{"title": "Ajal", "text": "Ajal (Arabic: الأجل , lit: limit or term) is a Qur'anic term, which means something's timespan or the end of something's period. In humans, \"ajal\" means the time of their death . In the Qur'an, \"ajal\" and its cognates were used fifty six times concerning different issues. For example, each nation is said to have a specific \"ajal\" (term) that is not hastened or postponed. According to some Quranic exegetes , Quranic verses refer to two types of ajal for humans: ajal musamma (specified term) or the inevitable time of death, and ajal mu'allaq (suspended term) or the changeable time of death. Ajal is discussed in Islamic theology under the problem of free will and predestination . Notion and Significance \"Ajal\" refers to something's timespan or the end of something's period. With regard to humans, it refers to the end of one's life, that is, the time of death. The word, \"ajal\", and its cognates were used fifty six times in the Qur'an concerning different things, including the following: The creation of the sky and the earth has a specific term, and thus, they will expire after a specific period. [1] The movements of the sun and the moon will come to an end at a specific time. [2] God postpones the punishment of sins to a specific time, that is, the time of death or resurrection . [3] The fetus's stay in the mother's womb has a specific term. [4] Nations have specific terms, and when their end comes, it will not be delayed, nor hastened. [5] God specified a determinate lifespan for every human person. [6] Types Some exegetes appeal to the second verse of Qur'an 6 , \"It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a term and a specified time [known] to Him; then [still] you are in dispute,\" to show that there are two types of ajal: musamma (specified term) and mu'allaq (suspended term). Ajal musamma (specified term) is an inevitable and unchangeable time of a human person's death, of which only God is aware. Ajal mu'allaq (suspended term) is the natural time of one's death which is subject to changes. Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i explains these two types of ajal as follows, the suspended term is the time of one's death in accordance with his bodily conditions. And ajal musamma is the inevitable time of one's death. In his view, given one's bodily conditions, he might be able to live one hundred years, which is his suspended term, but his actual time of death may be sooner or later than one hundred years, which is his specified term . In Islamic Theology Muslim theologians discuss ajal under their discussion of human free will and predestination . Verses of ajal were first appealed to by the Asha'ira as objections to the Mu'tazila who believed in free will. They claimed that since these verses talk about pre-determined times of everything, all actions should be attributed to God. For example, when a person murders another, the murderer has no free will, because the murdered person's ajal (time of death) was already specified by God. The Mu'tazila replied that humans do wrong actions, and since wrong actions cannot be attributed to God, they should be attributed to human persons themselves.

{"title": "Ajal Musamma", "text": "Ajal musammā (Arabic: الأجل المسمى , literally: specified term or specified time) is a Quranic term meaning the specified and inevitable end of something. It is contrasted to ajal mu'allaq which means the non-specified or suspended end of something. In the Qur'an, ajal musamma is used about human beings as well, which has been subject to different views by exegetes : on one such view, it refers to the determined time of one's death , and on another view, it refers to the afterlife world. Notion \" Ajal \" refers to the last time or moment of something, and \"musamma\" means determined or specified. Thus, \"ajal musamma\" means the specified temporal span of something, which cannot be shortened or lengthened. It is contrasted to ajal mu'allaq , which is the temporal span of something, which can be shortened or lengthened, depending on certain circumstances. Different Interpretations Ajal musamma is a Quranic term. It occurs 21 times in the Qur'an for a variety of things. For example, in verse Quran 2:282 it is used about the specification of a deadline for the repayment of debts. The term is used in the Qur'an about human beings as well Qur'an 6 :2. Quranic exegetes have propounded different views concerning the meaning of \"ajal musamma\" in these verses. Some of them hold that it refers to the human temporal span from death to the beginning of resurrection, as opposed to his temporal span in this world (from birth to death) which is \"ajal mu'allaq\" (or a non-specified term). Some of them take it to refer to the afterlife world. Some others believe that \"ajal musamma\" refers to the end of lives of people who are still alive, as opposed to the end of lives of people who are dead. Others believe that \"ajal musamma\" refers to the death of human beings. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , \"ajal musamma\" and \"ajal mu'allaq\" both refer to the end of human life. However, the former is a time in which the human person inevitably and certainly dies and which is only known to God, whereas the latter is the time of one's death given his or her physical conditions, which can be shortened or lengthened due to external factors. Difference from \"Ajal Mu'allaq\" According to some scholars, including Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i , the difference between \"ajal musamma\" and \"ajal mu'allaq\" is that the former is inevitable and certain, with no bada' (or change) occurring to it, whereas changes are possible in the latter. In other words, some actions such as supplications , charity , and the like can affect ajal mu'allaq (by lengthening it), but they have no effect on ajal musamma. Moreover, some Quranic verses, particularly the verse 2 of Sura An'am in which ajal musamma is only known to God, have been cited to show that only God knows ajal musamma.

{"title": "Allah", "text": "Allāh (Arabic: الله) is a proper name referring to the essence of God which possesses all perfect attributes . This is the best-known name of God in Islam and has an Arabic origin. There are practical laws in fiqh pertaining to this word, such as the laws according to which it is not religiously permissible to touch the written form of this word without Tahara . One of the most important features of this word is that it appears in the Islamic slogan of Tawhid and the impermissibility of giving this name to anything or anyone other than God. Notion \"Allah\" is a proper noun for God—the necessary being that has all perfect attributes . Equivalents in other languages: perhaps the English equivalent of this word is \"God\". Here are other equivalents: Persian: Khuda. Hindi: Khida. Hebrew: Yahweh or Elohim. Syriac: Allāhā Chaldean: 'Elah Greek: Theos Latin: Deus French: Dieu Italian: Dio Lexicology Root \"Allah\" is originally an Arabic word. Some people take it to be similar to Hebrew words, originating from \"Il\", and some take it to be originated from Syriac or Chaldean, originating from \"Ilaha\". But others think that the mere similarity is not enough to show that the word is not Arabic. Etymology Here are disagreements about the derivation of this word. Some hold that it is not derived from any root, but most etymologists believe that it is derived. The latter dispute, in turn, about its root—according to some reviews, there are about 20 or 30 different views in this regard. The widely accepted view is that \"Allah\" is derived from \"al-Ilāh\" (Arabic: الإله ), from the root \" ʾ- l- h \" (Arabic: أله ) which means worshiping. Thus it means the one who is worthy of worship and admiration. There are other proposals in this regard as well. Grammar When the word \"Allāh\" is used as an addressee, sometimes the addressing word (\"yā\" [Arabic: یا ], lit.: O!) is omitted, and instead an intensified (Mushaddad) \"mim\" is added, which turns as \"Allāhumma\" (Arabic: اللهم ). There are other views about the word \"Allāhumma\" as well. Laws of fiqh To the word \"Allāh\" apply the same laws of fiqh that do to other divine names and attributes, such as the laws that touching them without tahara is Haram (forbidden). Features This name has ten distinctive features in comparison with other divine names and attributes : It is the best known and the most popular name of God in Islam . For the Quran , the word has the highest place among other divine names. It has a distinctive role at the occasion of praying and requesting something from God. It is the pioneer of all divine names. The slogan of Tawhid (there is no god except Allah) exclusively involves this name. Shahadatayn (the words for expressing one's belief in Islam) involves this name of God. It is the proper name of God and it cannot be applied to, or used about, anyone or anything except God, neither literally nor figuratively. The word denotes a sacred essence who possesses all divine attributes. It can never be used as an adjective for a noun. All divine attributes are called with this name, but the reverse is not true. [12] Quranic Frequency According to some sources, if we exclude cases in which Allah is referred to by pronouns and the like, it has been used in the Quran 2,699 times. And if we add to this the five times in which the word \"Allahumma\" is used, the number will rise to 2,704 times. Some people have said that, taking into account \" Bism Allah \" and other cognates of the word, it is used 2,807 times in the Quran.

{"title": "Building over graves", "text": "Building over graves (Arabic: البناء على القبور ) means building any construction or structure over graves. There is a disagreement among Shia and Sunnis with Wahhabis about the Islamic ruling for building over graves. Islamic schools, especially Shia, have built constructions over the graves of great people and Islamic leaders and some Islamic scholars. This – with a conceptual expansion Wahhabis make – has a history and dates back to early Islam . According to historical shreds of evidence, it was not encountered with any objection from the Prophet (s) or the Followers . Wahhabis believe that building over the graves makes the grounds for worshiping them and polytheism in worshiping. Meaning of Building over Graves Building over graves, due to the many discussions related to it in fiqh , kalam and history, has become a term. It refers to any construction over graves, including qubba (dome), buq'a (mausoleum), darih , mosque , and even according to some, putting stones around the grave. It also includes constructions built prior to burial . Therefore, contrary to the meaning usually coming to the mind, it also includes leaving constructions built before burial. The Topic of Discussion and Dispute According to disputes made between Wahhabis and other Muslims, the discussion about building over graves refers to the religious ruling about constructing new buildings over graves and also Muslims' obligation regarding leaving built constructions over graves and its ruling. Historical Background Before Islam The grave of Prophet David (a) in Jerusalem and the graves of Prophets Abraham (a) , Isaac (a) , Jacob (a) and Joseph (a) in al-Khalil had tall buildings. At the time of the war led by Umar , Muslims did not destroy these graves and buildings. It shows that building over graves was neither reprehensible before Islam nor was it wrong in the views of Muslims in the early centuries of Islam. At the Time of the Prophet (s) The Holy Prophet (s) buried Fatima bt. Asad in a part of the mosque where was known as the grave of Lady Fatima (a) in Islamic history. Contemporary with Hudaybiyya peace treaty , the first construction or mosque was built over the grave of Abu Basir by Abu Jandal, and the Prophet (s) did not stop it while he (s) knew about it. At the Time of the Companions After the Prophet (s) passed away, he (s) was buried in his house, and preserving and repairing this house was made by Muslims and caliphs since the first years after his demise. First, 'Umar b. al-Khattab built a wall beside the grave of the Prophet (s) and separated it from the living place of Aisha . To expand the Prophet's (s) burial place, Walid b. 'Abd al-Malik (r. 86/705 – 96/715) destroyed the Prophet's (s) house, and in reconstruction, he appended the area surrounding the house to it and finally decorated the grave's chamber with alabaster. During the time of Mutawakkil (r. 228/847 – 242/861) and Musta'sim (ruling 640/1242 – 656/1258), this chamber was reconstructed. In 656/1258, the shrine of the Prophet (s) was decorated using the material the ruler of Egypt , Malik Mansur Ibak Salihi had sent, and the first dome called Qubba al-Zarqa was built over the chamber of the Prophet (s). In 765/1363-4, 852/1448-9, 881/1476-7, 886/1481-2, and 891/1486-7, it was reconstructed by Abbasid and Ottoman caliphs and domes were built over it. The lack of any objections to these reconstructions and expansions of the shrine by Muslims shows the legitimacy of this action and following the conduct of the Prophet (s) by Muslims and the permission for building over graves. Building over graves was a common action in the views of the Companions. When Al-Mughira b. Shu'ba expanded his house, the grave of Safiyya bt. Abd al-Muttalib , mother of Al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam , the aunt of the Prophet (s) was located inside the house, so a new structure was built over it. In the house of 'Aqil which gradually turned to become the dedicated place for the graves of Banu Hashim in Baqi' cemetery , the graves of Imams (a) and some companions had shrines. Ibn Athir reported sending an architect by Majd al-Mulk Qummi to repair the shrine and graves of four of Imams (a) and 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib. Ibn Jubayr, Ibn Najjar, Khalid b. 'Isa, Ibn Batuta and Awliya Chalapi in different times reported about the existence of some shrines over the graves of Imams (a). During the Time of the Followers The graves of Umm Salama and Umm Habiba , the Prophet's (s) wives, had a building over them. The graves of 'Aqil, his nephew, 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far b. Abi Talib , Ibrahim and some other children of the Prophet (s) had mausoleum and dome. Based on the report of Ibn Jubayr, the grave of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , Imam al-Hasan (a) and Ibrahim, son of the Prophet (s) were higher than the ground level. There are pieces of evidence that show that before 94/712, there was a building over the grave of Ibn 'Abbas . Second/Eighth Century The tradition of building over graves grew more in Islamic lands. The building over the grave of Ja'far, son of al-Mansur al-Abbasi (r. 136/754 – 158/775) shows the existence of building and dome over some graves in the 2nd/8th century; the building Harun al-Rashid (r. 170/786 – 193/809) built over the grave of Imam Ali (a) and the building over the grave of Sayyida Nafisa , a descendant of Imam al-Hasan (a) in Cairo are among the examples of this growth. Ibn Batuta reported about the existence of a mausoleum and mosque over the grave of Talha . Also, a mosque existed near the grave of Zubayr . Other examples of building over graves are the building and mausoleum over the grave of Salman Farsi in Mada'in and over the grave of Uways al-Qarani in Syria, a mosque over the grave of Sa'd b. 'Ubada , chief of Khazraj tribe, and also dome and mausoleum over the graves of Mu'adh b. Jabal , 'Aqaba b. 'Amir, Muhammad b. Abi Bakr and his sister Asma', Ibn Zubayr and Abu l-Hasan Dinawari, among the great Egyptian scholars in fiqh, Anas b. Malik , servant of the Prophet (s) and Sahl b. 'Abd Allah al-Tustari. After Third/Ninth Century In the first centuries after Islam, many cases of building constructions over graves and building mausoleums were seen. It happened in many consecutive centuries before the eyes of Muslims while none of the scholars, Shia or Sunni objected to these constructions, and no one believed that it is an act of polytheism or would deviate Muslims toward polytheism and idol-worshiping and worshiping other than God. Graves of Sunni leaders had dome and building too. The grave of Abu Hanifa (d. 150/767-8), leader of Hanafi school of fiqh in Baghdad had a dome and mausoleum which were built in the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries. Also, the grave of Malik b. Anas (d. 179/795), the leader of Maliki school , in Baqi' cemetery had a small dome. The grave of Muhammad b. Idris (d. 150/767), leader of Shafi'i school in Egypt and also the grave of Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 241/855), leaders of Hanbalis in Baghdad have had domes and have been reconstructed several times. The third/nineth century was when building domes over graves grew and since the fourth/tenth century, visiting them became common. An example of such graves is the grave of Muhammad b. 'Isa al-Tirmidhi (d. 296/892), which possibly belongs to the end of the third/ninth century and early 4th/10th century. In Aswan region in Nuba, which was one of the battlefields of Muslims with enemies, there are mausoleums from the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries over the graves of the martyrs of those wars. Since the sixth/twelfth century, many tombs were built around the Islamic world. In that century, when Sufism grew among Muslims, building Sufi tombs grew up; such as the tomb of Shaykh Ahmad Jam in Turbat Jam possibly built in sixth/twelfth century and the tomb of Bayazid Bastami built in eighth/fourteenh century. According to historical sources, Muslims have preserved and visited these buildings. Thus, the destruction of some buildings by caliphs, such as the destruction of the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) in 236/850-1 by Mutawakkil made Muslims upset and repulsive toward his action. Building over the Graves of Imams (a) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) The tradition of building mausoleums and shrines over the graves of Imams (a) is another historical evidence Muslims considered by Muslims. The grave of Imam Ali (a) has had a glamorous dome and building, and according to historical reports, its dome and building were built by Harun al-Rashid in second/eighth century and it was among old buildings over graves. Muhammad b. Yazid , a Shia ruler of Tabaristan , reconstructed this dome in 287/900-1. In an ode, Ibn Hajjaj Baghdadi, a poet of the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, mentioned the grave and dome of Imam Ali's (a) shrine . The first building over the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) was built when Mukhtar al-Thaqafi came to power. Later in 371/981-2, a darih made of teak was placed over the grave by order of 'Adud al-Dawla. Khatib Baghdadi mentioned the grave of Imam al-Kazim (a) among the graves of Quraysh which was visited and made entreaty to by Shias and some Sunni scholars. The shrine of Imam al-Rida (a) in Mashhad is such a building. Muhammad b. Mumal, a Hanafi scholar reported about the existence of Imam al-Rida's (a) mausoleum and shrine in Tus and also reported about visiting it by Sunni scholars. Ibn Habban introduced it a refuge for the helpless. In 333/944-5, Nasir al-Dawla Hamdani built a mausoleum over the graves of Imam al-Hadi (a) and Imam al-'Askari (a) in Samarra . Until the half of the second/eighth century, there was a shade over the grave of Lady Ma'suma (a) in Qom . In the second half of the third/ninth century, a mausoleum was built over it by Muhammad b. Zayd, da'i (caller) of Alawis (descendants of Imam Ali (a)). The brick entrance of the major gate to the shrine of 'Abd al-'Azim was made by Majd al-Din Barawistani, minister of Bakiyaraq Saljuki, in the fifth/eleventh century. The graves of Imams (a) in Baqi' cemetery, the grave of Banu Hashim and building dome over their graves, and also the grave of 'Abbas b. Abd al-Malik were constructed by order of Majd al-Mulk Barawistani in fifth/eleventh century and were reconstructed several times by caliphs. According to inscriptions available in these shrines, the first reconstruction was made by the Abbasid caliph Mustarshid Billah in 519/1125-6, and later in the early seventh/thirteenth century, Mustansir Billah made other repairs in the shrine. Islamic Ruling of Building over Graves In the two last centuries, Wahhabis issued a ruling for the destruction of constructions built over graves. The history of this ruling dates back to the seventh/thirteenth century and based on the theories of Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) and his pupil Ibn Qayyim (d. 751/1350) according to whom, destruction of these constructions and shrines is obligatory. Their first action was the destruction of the shrine and grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) in 1216/1801 and then, they destroyed the shrines of Imams (a) in Baqi' in 1221/1806. After reconstruction of destructed shrines, when Wahhabis took control of Hijaz in 1344/1926, they collected rulings of scholars in Medina on the issue and began destroying the mausoleums of the Companions and Infallible Imams (a) in Baqi'. This way, the issue of building over the graves turned into one of the controversial issues in the Islamic world. However, contrary to the beliefs of this group, other Muslims considered it permissible to build over graves, any construction including a mausoleum, mosque, or school. Shia and some Sunnis consider it in accordance with Muslims' tradition. Some Sunni faqihs, only in some cases, have considered it reprehensible, and some others consider construction over the graves of the Prophets (s), martyrs, and the righteous recommended. Some Sunni researchers believe that the disagreement made about the issue of construction around graves is because of Wahhabis' carelessness about hadiths prohibiting construction and their lack of attention toward justifications against them. Prohibitions in these hadiths are not general, and they are about special cases and are based on some reasons such as touching the materials of construction with fire, their heaviness on the buried body, or their separation from the graves of other Muslims and preventing the burial of other Muslims near them. According to principles of usul, a ruling which has its justification with it is specific to a certain case; the justification is given for and cannot be generalized for other cases. Moreover, contrary reasons are permitting the construction, which are even stronger in reference and chain of transmission than proscriptive narrations. Even proscriptive narrations regard this action as reprehensible. However, the graves of religious personalities, the righteous, and martyrs are out of this reprehension because they are considered among religious sacraments, and building mosques and mausoleum over their graves is honoring them because their graves are distinguished and people visit them. According to the glorious Qur'an , upholding religious symbols is a sign of spiritual health and sincerity in intention. The View of the Qur'an In the dispute between Muslims and polytheists over the bodies of the People of the Cave, the glorious Qur'an mentions the opinions of both parties. Some suggested building a mausoleum or wall in front of the cave, \"they said, 'Build a building over them.\" (18:21) so that they would be hidden from people's sight. Some others suggested building mosque or temple over their graves, \"'We will set up a place of worship over them.'\" (18:21) Finally, they decided to build a mosque over their graves so that people worship God there, and also the work of the People of the Cave would be kept and be blessed by their graves. In these verses, there is no mention of the polytheistic nature of this action, for if building construction or mosque was polytheistic, it must have been mentioned.

{"title": "Bodily Resurrection", "text": " Bodily resurrection (Arabic: المعاد الجسماني , al-Ma'ād al-Jismānī) is an Islamic doctrine according to which a human being will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment (Qiyama) with both of his or her body and soul . This is a belief over which all Muslims have consensus , though there are disagreements about its features and qualities. According to a popular view among scholars of theology , the very physical body in this world will be resurrected on Dooms Day. To support their view, they appeal to Qur'anic verses and hadiths . Islamic philosophers have different views about bodily resurrection, from a philosophical denial of the phenomenon to a version of bodily resurrection according to which human beings will be resurrected with bodies different from their material or physical bodies in this world, such as Mithali (analogical) or Hurqalya's bodies. According to Islamic philosophers, it is intellectually compromised to believe the apparent implications of the Qur'anic verses and hadiths. In order to solve the disagreement between the view of philosophers and the apparent implications of the Qur'an and hadiths, Mulla Sadra has propounded the theory of bodily resurrection with Mithali bodies. Notion The word \"Ma'ad\" (Arabic: المعاد ) literally means return or where people return to. In the terminology of the scholars of theology , the word means resurrection—the return of the dead to life in the afterlife —which is of two sorts: bodily (Arabic: جسمانی , Jismani), and spiritual (Arabic: روحانی , Ruhani). In this approach, the doctrine of the bodily resurrection is essential to Islam, the denial of which leads to infidelity. According to this doctrine, human beings are composed of a soul and a body. When their this-worldly life ends, they go to the world of Barzakh . When the Dooms Day arrives, they go back to life with both of their bodies and souls, and they go to God for an evaluation of their actions in this world. If they were righteous during their mundane lives, they will be rewarded by heaven , and if they were wrong-doers, they will be punished by the hell . Theories Different theories have been proposed about the bodily resurrection. Some people deny the doctrine, and some people have accepted it. Proponents of the doctrine differ, in turn, over what bodily resurrection will be like. Here is an outline of such theories: The return of the very mundane material body : scholars of theology have appealed to the apparent implications of the Qur'anic verses and hadiths to show that on Dooms Day, the very body one had during his or her life in this world or something like it will be resurrected together with his or her soul. The conjunction of the soul with a Mithali body : in order to reconcile evidence from the Qur'an and hadith with philosophical principles, Mulla Sadra presented a new theory about bodily resurrection. According to this theory, after its separation from the material body, the human soul will create a body for itself which is congenial to the worlds of Barzakh and Qiyama and is nonetheless qualitatively similar or indistinguishable from its this-worldly or mundane body. The Mithali body is not identical with the mundane body, rather it is just qualitatively similar to it, and while it has material features (such as shape and size), it is not material (it has no matter—no mass or volume). The return of the elemental body to the immaterial soul : some proponents of the Transcendent Philosophy of Mulla Sadra , such as Aqa Ali Zunuzi , maintain that, unlike what Mulla Sadra thinks, the body is not created in the afterlife by the soul. Instead, the mundane body (the one we have in this world) continues its development and perfection after its separation from the immaterial soul. This substantial motion continues to the point where the body is so developed that it can be conjoined with the immaterial soul once again. Therefore, in the afterlife, it is not the soul that returns to the body; rather it is the body that develops towards to the soul and returns to it. Bodily resurrection with a developed elemental body : other proponents of the Transcendent Philosophy, such as Sayyid Abu l-Hassan al-Rafi'i al-Qazwini , take Mulla Sadra's view to be in direct contradiction with the apparent implications of Qur'anic verses and hadiths . According to his own view, the human soul attaches to a Mithali body after its separation from the material body. And when the elements of the material body undergo a natural evolution and are capable of appearing in the afterlife, the bodily resurrection occurs. The afterlife body is created by the earth and mundane materials, and it can be adapted to the afterlife through a gradual development, so that it can be attached to the immaterial soul. Resurrection with a Hurqaliyati body : according to the view propounded by Ahmad b. Zayn al-din b. Ibrahim al-Ahsa'i , the founder of Shaykhiyya sect, human beings have two physical bodies. The first one is the mundane body they have in this world, which will turn into earth after death and will be destroyed. The second one is not visible; it is the \"Tinat\" (nature or innate) that survives the destruction of human bodies in graves. At the time of death, the soul is separated from the first body, but the second body survives and attaches to the soul in the afterlife. The resurrection will occur with this latter body, and it is the body with which people go to heaven or hell . Origin of Controversies Some disagreements about the bodily resurrection have their origin in some objections to the doctrine. Some people accept these objections, believing that the material, elemental body does not return to existence after the death, but some people try to counter the objection in different ways. Some evidence for the doctrine of the bodily resurrection are intellectual or philosophical, and some are from the tradition of Qur'anic verses and hadiths. And some objections to the bodily resurrection include: the impossibility of repetition of nothingness (or I'ada al-Ma'dum), the Eater and the Eaten objection , and the impossibility of metempsychosis (or Tanasukh ). The second origin of controversies are the different views concerning the nature of human beings. Thus people, such as Islamic philosophers, who believe that human beings have immaterial souls, accept only the spiritual resurrection. Some people who deny the immaterial soul, such as scholars of theology, subscribe only to the bodily resurrection, and some people, such as atheists (who take the human beings to be identical to its body), deny both the bodily and the spiritual resurrections. Qur'anic Verses There are three verses of the Qur'an regarding cases of reviving the dead which might be appealed to in favor of the bodily resurrection: The story of the prophet, 'Uzayr (a) (Ezra), or Irmiya (a) (Jeremiah) the prophet, The revival of birds by Prophet Ibrahim (a) , The revival of a person from Israelites . These cases might show the possibility of the bodily resurrection. Moreover, there are some Qur'anic verses referring to the dead coming out of their graves in the resurrection, such as verses 24 and 25 of Qur'an 7 and verses 66-68 of Qur'an 19 , as well as verse 7 of Qur'an 22 . Quality In order to explain the bodily resurrection in terms of the Qur'anic verses and hadiths, there are some points to be taken account of: According to the apparent implications of such textual evidence, the elemental, material body returns with its main parts. The afterlife and the mundane bodies are exact, indistinguishable duplicates, rather than being identical. According to hadiths , whatever turns into earth or whatever is eaten by animals will not be missed in divine knowledge. All the earths (to which human bodies have turned) will be reassembled and by the leave of God, it will go where the soul is, regaining its previous human shape and form, and finally attaching to the soul. According to some other hadiths, though people's bones and flesh turn into earth, their Tinat (the nature) or the main parts from which the person was created will survive. These parts that can never be destroyed will regain their previous shape in the afterlife.

{"title": "Ajal Mu'allaq", "text": "Ajal mu'allaq (Arabic: الأجل المعلَّق ), or suspended time or term, is an indeterminate and changeable time of one's death. It is contrasted to ajal musamma , which refers to the determinate and inevitable time of one's death, of which only God is aware. In the view of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i , ajal mu'allaq is the time of one's death in accordance with his or her bodily circumstances, which can be hastened or postponed depending on external factors. According to Islamic sources, one's death is postponed by things such as charity , ties with one's relatives , good behaviors towards one's neighbors, quitting sins, and visiting Imam al-Husayn (a) . And there are things that shorten one's life, such as committing sins like fornication , offending one's father or mother, false oath , and cutting ties with one's family . Ajal In Arabic, \"ajal\" refers to something's time span or temporal period. When applied to humans, it means the time of death. In the Qur'an , humans are said to have two types of ajal: ajal musamma (or determined time or term) and ajal without any qualifications, to which exegetes have referred as \"ajal ghayr musamma\" (undetermined time or term), \"qada' ghayr mahtum\" (non-decided fate), and \"ajal mu'allaq\" (suspended time or term). Definition According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , ajal musamma is the determined and inevitable or unchangeable time of one's death, of which only God is aware. It is contrasted to ajal mu'allaq, which refers to the natural time of one's death, which is changeable. In his view, ajal mu'allaq is the time of one's death depending on his or her bodily conditions. Thus, a person whose bodily conditions allow him to live one hundred years, his \"suspended term\" (that is, the time of his death) is one hundred years. However, the same person might indeed die sooner or later because of other factors, and this is his \"determined term\" (ajal musamma). Origin Ajal mu'allaq (suspended time or term) and ajal musamma (determined term) were debated under Quranic verses , particularly the verse 2 of Sura al-An'am (4), in which two \"ajal\"s or terms for the human being are referred to: \"It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a term (ajal) and a specified time (ajal musamma) [known] to Him.\" Some exegetes appeal to this verse to show that there are two ajals or terms for the human being: inevitable and suspended; the Qur'an refers to the former as \"musamma\", whereas the latter is mentioned without any modifiers, and was later called \"mu'allaq\" (suspended) by scholars. There are other interpretations of the two types of ajal as well. For example, some people believe that \"ajal musamma\" in the verse refers to one's life span from death to the beginning of resurrection , and the other type of ajal is one's life span in this world. It is also said that \"ajal musamma\" is the end of the life of people who are still alive, in contrast to another type of ajal which is the end of the life of people who are dead. Affecting Factors According to Quranic verses and hadiths , some actions postpone or hasten one's ajal mu'allaq. Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i cites verses 3 and 4 of Sura Nuh (71) to show that worshiping God , piety , and obeying the Prophet (s) postpone one's death. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi quoted Imam al-Sadiq (a) as saying: \"people who die because of sins are greater in number than people who die of natural causes, and people whose life is lengthened by their good conducts are greater in number than people whose life is lengthened by natural causes.\" According to hadiths, one's ajal mu'allaq is postponed by charity, ties with one's relatives , good behaviors towards one's neighbor, quitting sins, visiting Imam al-Husayn (a) , frequently thanking God , and reciting Sura al-Ikhlas (112) after every prayer . Moreover, some actions hasten ajal mu'allaq, such as fornication , offending one's father and mother, false oath , and cutting ties with one's family .

{"title": "Al-Sirat", "text": " Al-Ṣirāṭ (Arabic: اَلصِّراط ) is a bridge over the Hell that all people should cross on the Day of Resurrection . According to Islamic sources, this passage has some stations in which one's beliefs and deeds are evaluated. Due to their performance in this world, some people cross the bridge faster than others, and some people will stay there for thousands of years, and some of them will fall from the bridge to the Hell. The belief in Sirat is one of the basic tenets of Islam. Lexicology In the Holy Qur'an , the words \"ṣirāṭ\", \"ṭarīq\" (Arabic: اَلطَّریق ) and \"sabīl\" (Arabic: اَلسَّبیل ) are very close in meaning: they all mean the path or the way. According to al-Raghib al-Isfahani , the difference between these three words is as follows: \"sirat\" is a main way or an obvious path, \"sabil\" is an easy, smooth way, and \"tariq\" is a way that can only be traveled on foot. Nature According to 'Allama Tihrani , sirat is a metaphor for the closest internal path to knowing God. He maintains that every person has in oneself paths to knowing God. This is embodied in the resurrection as a bridge to the Heaven. He holds that the Infallibles (a) have traveled the closest and the fastest way to God, and this is why their way of knowledge is called \"al-ṣirāṭ al-mustaqīm\" (Arabic: اَلصِّراطَ المُستَقیم ) (the right path); a path that is sharper than a sword and narrower than a hair string. In the Holy Qur'an The word \"sirat\" occurred 45 times in different verses of the Holy Qur'an, all in its singular form. And in 32 of these verses, the word is modified with the adjective \"mustaqim\" (right or straight). In exegetical books, the word is discussed mostly under the Holy Qur'an 1:6: “ Guide us to the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim) ” According to hadiths , the belief in sirat is a basic Shiite belief. Al-Sirat al-Mustaqim (the Straight Path) In many cases, sirat is characterized in the Holy Qur'an by the adjective \"mustaqim\" (straight). In an interpretation of the well-known quote, \"the paths to God are as many as people's souls\", 'Allama Tihrani says that although there are many ways to God, the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim) is the only and the best path of closeness to God. Those different paths can take people to God insofar as they are close to the straight path. Here are some instances of the straight path in the Holy Qur'an and hadiths: A path that leads to knowing God The Prophet (s) Amir al-Mu'minin (a) Infallible Imams (a) God's religion Worshiping God Relation with God. Given that there is only one straight path, Imam Khomeini writes that all the above are instances of one and the same path. The application of the straight path to humanity, its leader (the Prophet (s) and Imams (a)), the religion, and the bridge on the Hell is compatible with there being only one such path, since they are all paths to the Heaven and to God. Features According to hadiths from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , sirat is a bridge over the Hell which is sharper than a sword and narrower than a hair string. The Hell mediates between people and the Heaven; all people should cross the bridge. Some of them cross it as fast as light, some cross as fast as a horse, and some crawl on it, and some cross it with a lot of difficulty while hanging from it, with fire on parts of their bodies. Some scholars assimilated the narrowness of sirat to Imam 'Ali (a) 's lifestyle that was very cautious with his painstaking attitude to comply with divine orders. Some hadiths that take Imam 'Ali (a) as an instance of sirat support such an analogy. It is not known whether sirat passes through the Hell or is placed over it. Stations One difficulty of the sirat is that there are stations ('aqaba), or checkpoints, so to speak, on it. According to al-Shaykh al-Saduq , these stations are obligations and prohibitions that have to be observed in this world. Each of the stations is called after one of these obligations and prohibitions. If one failed to comply with any of these in this world, then he or she will be questioned for thousands of years, and if one complied with it in this world, then he or she will pass it fast to the next station, and so on to the Heaven. Here are some important stations of sirat: The wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) Honesty and family ties Helping the oppressed people Saying prayers How one has earned money and how one has spent it Khums Zakat Hajj and 'umra Fasting Factors that help one to keep on the sirat According to Quranic verses and hadiths, there are things that help one not fall from the sirat to the Hell: Hoping divine mercy Reciting salawat Wilaya of Ahl al-Bayt (a) Loving Ahl al-Bayt (a) Visiting Ahl al-Bayt (a) Having perfect wudu Taking care of the five daily prayers Continuous attendance of congregational prayers Saying night prayers Helping a believer Lending money to a Muslim brother Removing the worries of a Muslim brother Paying sadaqa , especially in Laylat al-Qadr 10 days of fasting in the month of Rajab 26 days of fasting in the month of Sha'ban Istighfar in the month of Sha'ban Vigilance in the 23rd night of the Ramadan month, and saying 100 rak'as of prayers in that night Taking care of a patient Intercession for people's affairs Being ashamed before God Being content to the divine fate First People Who Cross the Sirat According to hadiths, the Holy Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) are the first people who cross the sirat.

{"title": "Embodiment of Actions", "text": " Embodiment of Actions (Arabic: تَجَسُّمُ الأَعْمال ), incarnation of actions or symbolization of actions is an expression in Islamic philosophy and theology meaning the embodiment of human actions in front of them on the Day of Judgment . It means that people's good deeds in this world will take form in the hereafter as heavenly blessings, while bad deeds will take form as fire, chains ,and different forms of punishment . Since it is a good explanation of the relation between action and its reward, this teaching is very important in discussions regarding the hereafter and scholars of theology, philosophy and exegesis have always discussed it. Mulla Sadra was among the advocates of the embodiment of actions and al-'Allama al-Majlisi was among its critics. Although there are different views about embodiment of actions, but after Mulla Sadra could present better explanations about embodiment of actions, it was welcomed by a majority of scholars. Meaning of the Embodiment of Actions According to the principle of the embodiment of actions, reward and punishment of people's good or bad deeds is not something other than those deeds themselves and the deeds and their rewards are related in creation and an outside agent of punishment is non-existent; for example, if it has been said that the punishment for a sin is the hellfire , that fire is nothing separate from that sin, but it is rather the reality of that sin which will be embodied and appear as fire. Everything people do, whether good or bad has a form in this world and a form in the hereafter which is hidden in the essence of that action and on the Day of Resurrection , it will lost its form in this world and will appear in its form in the hereafter and causes happiness and pleasure or sadness and grief. Beside the embodiment of actions, the issue of the embodiment of intentions or states of the soul have been discussed as well, which means that the true appearance of human being depends on those intentions, qualities and states of his soul. Therefore, although people are similar in form but they are different regarding spiritual appearance i.e. qualities and states. Embodiment of Actions in the Qur'an and Hadiths The concept of the embodiment of actions can be found in many verse of the Qur'an as well as in hadiths . In the glorious Qur'an, there are verses suggesting that on the Day of Judgment , anyone will see his actions themselves, such as: \"On that day, mankind will issue forth in various groups to be shown their deeds.* So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,* and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it. \"The day when every soul will find present whatever good it has done\" Of course there are other verses which suggest the legal nature (not in creation) of punishment and the existence of outside agents of punishment including: \"So that Allah may reward every soul for what it has earned. Indeed Allah is swift at reckoning. \"If You punish them, they are indeed Your creatures; but if You forgive them, You are indeed the All-mighty, the All-wise.\" Also, in some hadiths, embodiment of actions has been explicitly mentioned; for example, the noble Prophet (s) addressed one of the companions : \"Surly, you will have companions buried with you in the grave. If it is honorable, it will make you honorable and if it is dishonorable, it will make you so. It will not be resurrected unless with you and you will not be resurrected unless with it. You will not be questioned unless with it, so make it honorable, because if it is worthy and good, you will love it and if it is unworthy and corrupt, you will just be afraid of it and it is your deed.\" Also Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"when God resurrects a believer from grave , a symbolical being comes out of the grave and goes before him. The believer tells him, \"who are you?\" he answers, \"I am the happiness and joy you made in your brother. God created me to bring you good news.\" In these two hadiths, appearing deeds in symbolical forms have been clearly stated. Critics to Embodiment of Actions These verses and narrations have made different opinions to be presented about rewards of actions. Some scholars considered verses in contradiction with embodiment as fundamental and interpreted the verses suggesting embodiment so that they do not have any contradiction with the verses in contradiction with embodiment; for example, in the verse mentioned from the Qur'an 99 , most commentators, especially the early ones, interpreted \"to be shown their deeds\" as seeing the rewards of their deeds or the report of their actions, not their deeds themselves. Most early commentators supported this view. Some of these commentators including Fakhr al-Razi and al-Tabrisi defended this interpretation saying that, actions are accidental properties and they are not permanent and their return is impossible; thus, saying that actions themselves will be embodied is wrong. Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi was also among critics of the embodiment of actions. His justification is that the embodiment of actions is in contradiction with the belief in Bodily Resurrection . He disapproved al-Shaykh al-Baha'i 's view and suggested that believing in the embodiment of actions will lead to denial of Islam . This opinion caused a serious reaction from the advocates of the embodiment of actions. Advocates of the Embodiment of Actions On the opposite side, most contemporary commentators and theologians have accepted the verses regarding the embodiment of actions as they are understood literally without any extra interpretation, including al-Shaykh al-Baha'i who did not consider reward for actions, a presumption in interpreting verse 6 of Sura al-Zilzal, and believed that actions themselves will be seen. He was among serious advocates of the embodiment of actions, and in this regard, refers to the mentioned verses and different narrations – which he says both supporters and critics have narrated. He says that the serpents and scorpions promised for the hell are the reprehensible actions, beliefs and morals which will be represented as such, while virgins and the green and as such are righteous acts, beliefs and morals and this difference in representations is due to the difference in gradation. Before al-Shaykh al-Baha'i, this view had advocates among mystics including Rumi . Mulla Sadra and Explanation of the Issue in Transcendental Philosophy Using his principles in Transcendental Philosophy , Sadr al-Muta'allihin could propose better explanations about the embodiment of actions, so that after him, this belief received approval of the majority. He brought up issues such as the essential movement , corporal resurrection , unity of the intellectual and the intellect and presented a special intellectual framework and tried to make a rational explanation of the embodiment of actions. According to Mulla Sadra, the same way material things influence the mind, mental things influence material things as well. The influence of material things on other material things and mental things are not the same; for example, wet things in contact with non-wet things make them wet, but when imagined, does not make imagination wet, but makes an imaginary form of itself there and when thought of, forms a general intellectual form in the mind. Thus, one reality can make different influences in different places. Moreover, a state like anger which is a mental state can be manifested outside in a materialistic form such as redness of the cheeks or rapid heartbeat. Thus, it is not impossible that this anger would be manifested as fire. Humans' actions can turn into spiritual states and dispositions, i.e. it might be manifested in non-corporal form. In the hereafter too, the same spiritual states and dispositions can turn into that world forms. After Mulla Sadra, this theory received many supporters including al-Fayd al-Kashani and Mulla Hadi Sabziwari . Among contemporary scholars, too, critics and advocates of this view have spoken. However, some contemporary scholars believe that accepting the embodiment of actions has no contradiction with accepting the existence of punishments and rewards of legal nature, since some verses in the Qur'an (some examples of which were mentioned) appear to mean so and there is no problem in believing both.

{"title": "Barzakh", "text": " Barzakh (Arabic: بَرزَخ ) is a world between this world and hereafter ; it is also called the imaginal world or the world of grave . Brazakh exists for both believers and non-believers, though it is similar to the Heaven for the former, and similar to the Hell for non-believers. Meaning 'Barzakh' in Arabic literally means an interval or a barrier between two things, and technically it means an interval between the end of this-worldly life (death) and the beginning of hereafter. The world is called 'Barzakh' because it is an interval between this world and the hereafter. The world is also called the world of grave and the imaginal world. In the Qur'an The word 'Barzakh' has been mentioned three times in the Qur'an . but only in Qur'an 23 :100 it has been used in the meaning in question: “ حَتَّى إِذَا جَاء أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ (۹۹) لَعَلِّی أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِیمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّا إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَائِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى یوْمِ یبْعَثُونَ \"When death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord! Take me back (99) that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.' 'By no means! These are mere words that he says.' And ahead of them is a Barzakh until the day they will be resurrected.\" ” — Qur'an, Qur'an 23:99-100 According to this verse of the Qur'an, the request of some people at the time of their death to return to the world in order to do the good deeds that they have not done is not in place, and they face a barrier or an interval—a Barzakh—until the Day of Judgment . The phrase \"until the day they will be resurrected\" indicates that Barzakh is an interval between this world and the hereafter, that anyone experiences after their death and before the Day of Judgment. Proof in the Qur'an In addition to verse 100 of Qur'an 23 that explicitly shows the existence of Barzakh, some verses prove Barzakh without mentioning the word 'Barzakh'. These verses concern the life of martyrs after their deaths: And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their lord. [5] And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive. [6] Moreover, according to Qur'anic verses, Barzakh is not restricted to martyrs—a sinner like Pharaoh and his friends also experience Barzakh: In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the day that judgment will be established: 'cast ye the people of pharaoh into the severest penalty! ( Qur'an 23 :46) [7] The verse obviously points to a penalty for Pharaoh and his people before the penalties of the Day of Judgment, and that is the penalty in Barzakh. In Hadiths Definition In some hadiths , the word 'Barzakh' is used to mean an interval between this world and the hereafter. For instance, according a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , all (true) Shiites will go to the Heaven in the hereafter, and, the hadith goes on, 'I swear to God that I fear about you in Barzakh'. A person asked him about Barzakh, and Imam answered: '[it is] the grave, from one's death to the Day of Judgment'. This latter statement implies that the world of grave is the world of Barzakh —indeed, grave in this hadith does not mean a certain hole in the earth; it is a metaphor for Barzakh. Barzakh's Heaven and Hell Some hadiths state that the world of Barzakh has its own heaven and hell in which people are rewarded or punished for their deeds. The Prophet (s) says: \"the grave is either a garden of heaven or a hole of hell\". Question of the Grave A number of hadiths show that once people enter the world of Barzakh, they are questioned about their beliefs and deeds. This questioning is known as \"the question of the grave\". Barzakhi Body Human soul attaches to an imaginal or Barzakhi body. An imaginal body is one that is not of a material kind, and yet enjoys some characteristics of material objects, such as shape and size. In these respects, the imaginal body is like a person's natural body. In order to have a clear picture of an imaginal or Barzakhi body, one might reflect on the forms or images that one observes while dreaming. Such forms are undoubtedly non-material; they do not occupy any space and they do not have any mass, and yet they have a shape and a size and they have forms like those of material objects.

{"title": "Expiation of Sins", "text": "Expiation (takfīr) of sins (Arabic: تکفیر الذنوب ) is the elimination of sins or their consequences on the Day of Judgment as a reward of good deeds. In the Qur'an and hadiths , faith , righteous deeds, repentance , and alms-giving in secret, among others things, are counted among the actions that expiate sins. Twelver Shiites and Ash'arites accept expiation only in the cases mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths, but the Mu'tazila believes in expiation for all sins. Imami theologians maintain that the Mu'tazili view is against some Qura'nic verses according to which good deeds and evil deeds will be separately rewarded and punished separately. Definition Etymologically, takfir (expiation), means to cover and hide. This is why the word \"kafir\", from the same root, is used for the one who is ungrateful for God's blessings , as if he hides them. Takfir (expiation) in theology is the elimination of sins or their punishment with the reward of righteous deeds. Takfir stands in contrast to ihbat , which is the elimination of the reward of righteous deeds as a consequence of sins. The word \"takfir\" is also used in the sense of excommunication, or attributing kufr (disbelief) to a Muslim . Causes of Expiation In the Qur'an and hadiths, some deeds are introduced as expiating sins, including faith , righteous deeds, repentance , refraining from grave sins , alms-giving in secret, jihad , intercession , visiting the shrine of Imam al-Husayn (a) , reciting the Qur'an , and performing night prayers . Expiation in Theology Expiation for sins is also a theological issue, usually discussed together with the issue of ihbat. It is discussed under the topic of resurrection by some Shi'a and Sunni scholars, and under the topic of promise and threat (al-wa'd wa-l-wa'id) by Mu'tazili theologians. Muslim theologians agree that if a disbeliever converts to Islam , his prior disbelief and sins will be expiated. However, there is disagreement as to the sins committed by a Muslim while being a Muslim: The Mu'tazila maintains that all sins can be expiated and that a righteous deed can eliminate all kinds of sin. [17] The reason behind this belief, it is said, is that the Mu'tazila believes that a person who does righteous deeds deserves reward and the one who commits sins deserves punishment. Now, if a person's deeds were a mixture of righteous deeds and sins, he would deserve punishment and reward at the same time, [18] which is not possible. Thus, the Mu'tazila developed the theory of ihbat and takfir to avoid this problem. [19] Shi'a and Ash'arites [20] do not accept the theory of general ihbat and maintain that righteous deeds only expiate for those sins that are mentioned in the Qur'an or hadiths. [21] In this regard, they adduce verses such as \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it\" [22] , according to which righteous deeds and sins will be rewarded and punished separately. [23] Elimination of the Sin or Its Punishment? There is also disagreement as to whether the sin itself will be eliminated or only its punishment. It is reported that Abu Ali al-Jubba'i, a prominent Mu'tazili figure, maintained that the sin itself will be eliminated, but his son Abu Hashim, another outstanding Mu'tazili theologian, held that only the punishment will be removed. Muslim philosophers who believe that expiation eliminates the sin itself and at the same time maintain that no being goes out of existence give either of the following explanations: Sin is essentially non-existent. Just as the being of a sinner transforms into another being, his sins also transform into righteous deeds. [25] See Also Ihbat Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related Death Related"}
{"title": "Faith of Abu Talib", "text": "The faith of Abu Talib (Arabic: (إیمان أبی طالب(ع ) is one of the theological arguments between Shi'a and Sunni scholars. According to narrations from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , Shi'as have ijma' (consensus) on that Abu Talib , the uncle of the Prophet (s) and the father of Imam 'Ali (a) , had faith in the Prophet (s). But, Sunnis deny the faith of Abu Talib and refer to some narrations in some hadith and historical books which show that Abu Talib didn't believe in Islam and insisted on the belief of his ancestors until his death and died as a polytheist. Shi'a scholars, in addition to rejecting the reasons of deniers, stated their reasons on the faith of Abu Talib. Abu Talib describing the Prophet (s): \"Don't they know that our son is not a liar in our opinion? And he does not consider the word of the evil people. A protector of the orphans, a supporter of the widows. And a whiteface by whose face the rain is asked from the cloud. Don't they know that indeed the Prophet Muhammad, is the trustworthy prophet whose name is written in the previous books?\" Al-Mufid , , PP.283-4 Reasons of Deniers Verse of Prohibition of Asking Forgiveness for Polytheists The narration is: \" Sa'id b. Musayyib narrates from his father that Abu Talib didn't accept the word of the Prophet (s) about saying \"la ilah illa Allah\" (there's no god except Allah) (the profession of faith) and died on the faith of his father and ancestors, and the Prophet (s) said: \"I swear to God, I ask forgiveness for you until I become prohibited\". Then the verse 113 of Sura al-Tawba revealed: \"The Prophet (s) and the faithful may not plead for the forgiveness of the polytheists, even if they should be [their] relatives, after it has become clear to them that they will be the inmates of hell.\" Answer In the chain of the transmitters of this narration, there is somebody called Sa'id b. Musayyib. It is said that he had deviant and hostile behaviour towards Imam Ali (a) even in public. [2] . Allama Amini considers this narration in conflict with a sahih (true) narration which many Sunni scholars transmitted in their books: it's narrated from 'Ali (a): \"I heard someone asking forgiveness for his polytheist parents, I informed the Prophet (s) and the verse was revealed.\" [3] Al-Na'y (Avoidance) Verse Some consider the verse 26 of Qur'an 6 (al-Na'y verse), \"They dissuade [others] from him, and [themselves] avoid him\", is about Abu Talib, referring to this narration: Someone heard Ibn Abbas saying: \"Abu Talib was dissuading people from 'harassment' of the Prophet (s) but didn't himself become a Muslim.\" Answer The narration is mursal because the identity of the one who had heard from Ibn al-'Abbas is not clear. Habib b. Abi Thabit who transmitted this narration, is considered da'if (weak) even among Sunni scholars. [5] Jami' al-bayan interprets the verse differently: the verse is about the polytheists who were dissuading others from 'following' the Prophet (s) and themselves were avoiding him. [6] Next and previous verses confirm this meaning. Al-Dahdah Hadith Also a hadith named \"Dahdah\" is cited: Someone mentioned Abu Talib before the Prophet (s), and the Prophet (s) said: \"hopefully my shafa'a (intercession) will be beneficial for him in the Day of Judgment , he will be placed between two waters boiling by fire, which reaches his ankle and from there boils his brain.\" Answer Mughira b. Abi Shu'ba narrated this hadith and he -as stated by al-'Allama al-Majlisi - was famous for his animosity and hatred of Banu Hashim and especially 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and his fisq (lewdness) is obvious. [8] Assuming that Abu Talib was a polytheist, hoping shafa'a for him doesn't have any meaning, because it's clear that shafa'a doesn't include polytheists. [9] Reasons of the Supporters Shi'a scholars in addition to answering the reasons of the deniers, stated their reasons for the faith of Abu Talib: Activities of Abu Talib Abu Talib had invited his wife Fatima bt. Asad , his children, and the king of Abyssinia to Islam . When he saw his son, 'Ali (a) , was praying with the Prophet (s) , ordered his other son Ja'far to pray with them. He bore all of suffers, supporting the Prophet (s), and didn't give up supporting and following the Prophet (s) until his death. His last word was: \"O, you group of Banu Hashim , if you want salvation and guidance, confirm and obey Muhammad (s) .\" It was because of him that Banu Hashim supported the Prophet (s) in Mecca and tolerated the blockade in Shi'b Abi Talib (the valley of Abi Talib). Ibn Abi l-Hadid says: \"every Muslim owes Abu Talib until the Day of Judgment because if there wasn't him, Islam was not going to be around for long. It is narrated within many chains of narration from Ibn 'Abbas and others that he didn't die until he said shahadatayn (profession of faith).\" In another place, he says: \"if Abu Talib disclosed his faith he would lose his respect and credit among polytheists and could not support Islam as a head of Tribe.\" Poems Poems of Abu Talib are famous and reach a thousand lines. What came in these poems are all about verification and acknowledgement of the Prophet (s) : “ اِن ابن آمنة النبی محمدا عندی یفوق منازل الاولاد \"Truly, the son of , the Prophet, Muhammad, is upper than my children, for me.\" ” His most famous poem is named \"' Qasida al-Lamia \"' which begins with: \"O, my friends, I never hear the blame of the reprover, and I have no tendency to evil.\" 'Allama Amini says: \"I ask if the profession and admittance of the apostleship of the Prophet Muhammad (s) , with all these different expressions in the poems of Abu Talib, is not considered as a confession of faith! If one of these descriptions was in poems or words of someone else, everyone would say that he is a Muslim . But in the opinion of the deniers, given all these verbal and written descriptions, doesn't mean that Abu Talib is a Muslim. This denial is a matter of wonder!\" Ibn Abi l-Hadid says: \"Although these poems don't reach the extent of certainty, they are mutawatir (frequent) as a whole and all have one thing in common: Abu Talib acknowledges the prophecy of the Prophet of Islam (s) \". In one of these poems Abu Talib says: \"O, you witness of Allah to me, testify that I'm on the religion of the Prophet, Ahmad (s). If someone has a deviation from the religion, [I don't care because] I'm guided.\" He also says: \"The best of Banu Hashim is Ahmad (s) , the Prophet of God after a time (without any prophet).\" Also: \"I supported the Prophet (s), the Prophet of the Lord, with a sword shining like the flash of lightning. I will support and help him as a person cares for him.\" Hadiths of Ahl al-Bayt (a) On the virtues of Abu Talib, the Prophet (s) , Imam 'Ali (a) , and other Imams are all confirming that Abu Talib was a believer and died as a Muslim based on a related series of narrations. In a Qudsi hadith (Divine hadith) it's said that Gabriel came to the Prophet (s) and said: \"O, Muhammad, Allah greets you and says: I prohibited the fire from the loin and the womb which gave birth to you, and the arms embraced you.\" The Prophet (s) said: \"O, Gabriel, explain that to me.\" Gabriel said: \"the loin means your father, 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , the womb is your mother Amina bt. Wahb , and the arms is Abu Talib b. 'Abd al-Muttalib.\" Hadiths of the Prophet (s) As the Prophet (s) enjoyed the backing of Abu Talib in the most challenging periods of Islam, he was always mentioning him with respect and regard. The Prophet said to Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari : \"In the journey of Mi'raj , I saw 4 lights. Allah said: 'this is 'Abd al-Muttalib, this is your uncle Abu Talib, this is your father Abd Allah , and this is your mother Amina \" . He also said: \"In the Day of Judgement , Abu Talib will come as a king and with a face like a prophet .\" The Prophet further said: \"Indeed Allah promised me about the intercession ( shafa'a ) for four, one of them is Abu Talib\". Hadiths of Imam Ali (a) All the words of Imam 'Ali (a) , describing his father, are about his virtues and greatness. Imam 'Ali (a) said: \"The light of Abu Talib will dominate all lights except the light of The Five (a) . The light of Abu Talib is from our light which Allah created two thousand years before Adam.\" Also, he said: \"When my father was at his last moments, the Prophet (s) came to his bed and gave me glad tidings (promises) about him which seemed more appealing to me than the world and what is in it.\" Hadiths of other Imams Imam al-Sajjad (a) was asked about the faith of Abu Talib, he answered: \"I wonder at your question! God proscribes his Prophet (s) over a Muslim woman staying in the marriage of a polytheist. But Fatima bt. Asad was among the first Muslims who stayed in the marriage of Abu Talib until his demise. (So Abu Talib was not a polytheist)\". Imam al-Baqir (a) says: \"If the faith of Abu Talib is put in one side of a scale and the faith of these people on the other, the faith of Abu Talib will be preferred.\" Imam al-Sadiq (a) says: \"Abu Talib is like the Seven Sleepers (Ashab al-Kahf) who hid their faith and declared themselves as polytheists and God gave them their reward twice.\" In another hadith, he tells Yunus b. Nubata : \"The enemies of Allah are lying. He is a companion of the prophets, and the truthful, and the martyrs, and the righteous, and the excellent companions are they.\" Someone wrote to Imam al-Rida (a) that he had doubt in the faith of Abu Talib. Imam al-Rida (a) wrote to him the verse 115 of the Sura al-Nisa' : \"But whoever defies the Apostle, after the guidance has become manifest to him, and follows a way other than that of the faithful, We shall abandon him to his devices and We shall make him enter hell, and it is an evil destination.\" (Quran 4:115) And continued: \"Then if you do not confess to the faith of Abu Talib, your destination is the hell.\" Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) says: Allah told his Prophet (s):\"I helped you with two groups of followers: First the followers who helped you secretly, and second the followers who helped you openly. As for who helped you secretly, their eminent and the most virtuous is your uncle, Abu Talib, and as for who helped you openly, their eminent and the most virtuous is his son, 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) .\" Imam Hasan al-'Askari continues: \"indeed, Abu Talib was like Mu'min Al Fir'awn (the faithful of the family of Pharaoh ) who had hidden his faith.\"<refIbn Maʿadd, , p. 362.</ref> Words of Religious Scholars Al-Shaykh al-Tusi : \" Shi'as have ijma' (consensus) that Abu Talib was a Muslim and they have no disagreement on this.\" Al-Tabrisi : \"Ijma' of Ahl al-Bayt (a) is on the faith of Abu Talib.\" . Al-Fattal al-Niyshaburi : \"The rightful Shi'a have ijma' that Abu Talib, 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , and Amina bt. Wahb were all faithful and their ijma' is a proof.\" Ibn Ma'add : \"In the matter of the faith of Abu Talib, ijma' of Ahl al-Bayt (a) and ijma' of Shi'a scholars is enough for us and it could be trusted.\" Al-Sayyid b. Tawus : \"Ahl al-Bayt (a) have consensus that Abu Talib was faithful.\" He also says: \"it's obvious that Ahl al-Bayt (a) are more aware than foreigners about the inside of Abu Talib and also followers of Ahl al-Bayt (a) (Shi'as) have ijma' on it and they wrote books on it.\" Al-'Allama al-Majlisi : \"Shi'as have ijma' that Abu Talib was a Muslim and he had faith in the Prophet (s) from his bi'tha and that he never worshipped an idol. Rather he was one of the successors of Ibrahim (a) (Abraham). This is famous among Shi'a to the extent that even their deniers attribute this belief to Shi'a. Mutawatir hadiths exists from both Sunnis and Shi'as about his faith and many scholars have written books on this issue so it would not remain hidden.\" Bibliography of the faith of Abu Talib Agha Buzurg Tihrani mentions 9 books titled \"Iman Abi Talib\" (The faith of Abu Talib). Some other books are as follows: Iman Abi Talib (The faith of Abu Talib), by al-Shaykh al-Mufid (d. 413/1022).

{"title": "Fall of Adam (a) and Eve", "text": "The fall of Ādam (a) and Eve or Hubūṭ (Arabic: هُبوط ) is the ouster of Adam (a) and Eve from The Garden of Eden to the Earth. Some exegetes of the Qur'an interpreted the \"Fall\" not in physical or spatial terms as going out of the Heaven down to the Earth, rather in spiritual terms, that is, God has degraded the spiritual positions of Adam (a) and Eve, which is referred to as the \"Fall\". Other people believe that the Fall was not a punishment for Adam (a) and Eve, rather it was in their interest to fall to the Earth and undergo obligations and sufferings in order to achieve true happiness. Literal and Terminological Meanings The word, \"hubut\" ( هبوط ), literally means to fall down in a coercive way. Sometimes, the word is used as a humiliation, e.g. in the case of Iblis . And it is sometimes used as an honor, for example, the word has been used in the case of the prophet Noah 's (a) getting off his ship. The word, \"hubut\", is also used in other meanings. Fall of Adam (a) and Eve : Terminologically, the word, \"hubut\", refers to the story of Adam (a) and Eve going out of the Heaven. The Qur'an narrates the story as follows: \"He said, 'Get down both of you from it, all together\". After the Fall from the Heaven, Adam (a) and Eve resided on the Earth. Some exegetes believe that divine obligations—commands and prohibitions—were not in place prior to the Fall. Fall of Iblis : Iblis was once ordered by God to go out of His kingdom after refusing to prostrate for Adam (a). Once again, he was ordered to fall after tempting Adam (a) and Eve to eat the Forbidden Fruit: \"He said: So, fall from it\". Exegetes of the Qur'an provided different accounts to reconcile the two orders and to explain how Iblis entered the heaven while he was already ousted from the divine kingdom. Story When Adam (a) and Eve resided in the heaven , God gave them the permission to eat the fruits of every tree in the garden. He only forbade them from approaching a certain tree and being deceived by the devil. Adam (a) and Eve were tempted by Iblis (Satan) and ate the fruit of the Forbidden Tree. Iblis deceived them by saying that if they eat the fruit of the Forbidden Tree, then they will turn into angels or will have an eternal life. When they ate the fruit of the Forbidden Tree, the shameful parts of their bodies became apparent, and they were ousted from the heaven. According to Quranic verses, when Adam (a) and Eve learned about their mistakes, they repented and asked God to forgive them. God accepted their repentance , but they were ousted from the heaven, nonetheless. At God's command, they lived on Earth and started a new life. God made Adam (a) His successor on Earth and appointed him as His prophet . Heaven of Adam (a) and Eve In its reference to the creation of Adam (a) and Eve, the Qur'an refers to the first residence of the couple as \"heaven\". There are different views about where this heaven was. Al-Fakhr al-Razi points to three views and their arguments: a garden on the Earth, a heaven in the sky other than the promised Heaven, and the Promised Heaven. The Fall: Required by Divine Wisdom Some exegetes believe that the Fall was not intended as a punishment for Adam (a) and Eve. Sadr al-Muta'allihin and al-Tabrisi maintain that the Fall of Adam (a) and Eve from the Heaven to the Earth was not a punishment, because there are good reasons to believe that prophets never do what leads to divine punishments. God ousted them from the Heaven, because His wisdom required that they fall to the Earth and undergo obligations and sufferings in order to achieve true happiness at the end. Thus, the Fall and obligations subjected Adam (a) and Eve to Divine Rewards and happiness, and so, the Fall cannot be considered as a punishment. The Spiritual Fall Some exegetes believe that Adam’s (a) Fall was not a spatial fall—a fall from one place to another. Rather, it was a fall in his spiritual degrees. God degraded the position of Adam (a) and Eve because they did what they had better not do. Thus, they were deprived of heavenly blessings and suffered mundane pains. Notes References"}
{"title": "Day of Separation", "text": "Day of Separation or Yawm al-Faṣl (Arabic: یَوْم الفَصْل ) is a term in the Qur'an referring to the Day of Judgement . Exegetes of the Qur'an maintain that the Day of Judgement is referred to as such because it is on this day that the truth and falsehood will be separated. Meaning \"Al-Fasl\" literally means to \"cut off\" or \"separate\" in a way that a distance is created there between. In the Qur'an The term, \"Yawm al-Fasl\", is used in the Qur'an to refer to the Day of Judgement mainly for the purpose of reprehending and threatening polytheists or deniers. According to the Quran 37 :21 [2] and in Qur'an 44 :40 [3] , it is used to threaten the polytheists, and in its subsequent verses, the meaning of separation (al-fasl) is explained as follows: “ The day when a friend will not avail a friend in any way, nor will they be helped, except for him on whom Allah has mercy. Indeed He is the All-mighty, the All-merciful. ” — Qur'an 44 :41-42 In Qur'an 77 , the term, Yawm al-Fasl, has been used three times to refer to the Day of Judgement. In verses thirteen and fourteen, the greatness of the Day is characterized as follows: “ For what day has [all] that been set [to occur]? For the Yawm al-Fasl! And what will show you what is the Yawm al-Fasl!? Woe to the deniers on that day! ” — Qur'an 77 :12-14) And in Qur'an 78 :17, the Yawm al-Fasl is characterized as an appointed time in which all peoples are assembled [4] Interpretation 'Allama Tabataba'i holds that Yawm al-Fasl refers to the Day of Judgement because, according to the verse seventeen of Qur'an 22 , it separates people. And the Day of Judgement is called Yawm al-Fasl because it is on this day that the truth is separated from the falsehood and pious people are separated from sinners . He takes the verse fifty nine of Qur'an 36 , \"And Get apart today, you guilty ones!\", to be evidence for his interpretation . According to Tafsir-i nimuna , Yawm al-Fasl means the Day of Judgment in which God will adjudicate His servants. In this world, truths and falsehoods are intertwined, but on the Day of Judgement, they will be separated and the secrets will be revealed. Morteza Motahhari interprets Yawm al-Fasl as follows: \"Human beings form communities in this world on the basis of their appearances, but in the Day of Judgement, the reign is grounded in people's interiors and internal habits. In the afterlife , an angel -like person will not be able to communicate with evil people. Thus, there will be a separation between them. People will be resurrected with their leaders in flocks, with some of them having a leader in the Hell and some others having a leader in the Heaven .

{"title": "End Time", "text": " End Time or Akhir al-Zamān (Arabic: آخر الزمان ) is a religious title referring to the final period of the world which has been mentioned in all divine religions. In Islam , it has been mentioned either referring to a period of time related with the mission of the Prophet (s) , or referring to the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi . In common beliefs, End Time is known with extraordinary happenings. The most important characteristics of this period are the decline in people's religious practice and then the coming of a savior . The exact date of coming of the savior of the End Time is unknown and can only be determined with the ending period of time, which continues up to the Apocalypse and the end of the world. In the Qur'an The title \"Akhir al-Zaman\" ( آخر الزّمان ; End Time) is not mentioned in the Qur'an , but there are verses which are about the future of human society and suggest the government of monotheism and justice in the future of human life, inheriting the earth by righteous people and victory of the truth over falsehood. In Hadiths The expression of Akhir al-Zaman has been used in hadiths in two meanings: The Time of the Prophet (s) The time beginning with the mission of the Prophet (s) until the Resurrection . In some hadiths, the Prophet (s) has been referred to as the Prophet (s) of the End Time. Such a description is related to the fact that the Prophet (s) was the Last of the Prophets (s), and his religion is valid until the end of the time due to its perfection, and he (s) is the Prophet (s) of the last part of the time on earth. The Time of the Coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a) In many hadiths, End Time refers to the time when the Savior (the Promised Mahdi) comes and the certain occurrences happening at three different times: Difficult trials of the End Time including the Battle of Kirkisia [5] Coming of the Savior and the battle between the truth and the falsehood [6] Victory of the truth over falsehood and the golden age of the world [7] Determining its Time The exact time for these signs has not been mentioned in hadiths and even determining the exact time for them has been rejected. No one knows the exact time of coming of the Savior other than God and it is one of the issues of the Unseen . Imam al-Rida (a) quoted from the Prophet (s) that the time of the uprising of the Promised Mahdi (a) is like the Day of Judgment which no one knows of its time other than God and will happen all of a sudden. Signs The signs mentioned for this age in Islamic hadiths are known as the signs of the End Time. Thus the coming of the Promised Mahdi (a) has been likened to the Resurrection because the same way the Resurrection has various signs ( Ashrat al-Sa'a ), the coming of the Promised Mahdi (a) has signs which happen before it. In some books, these signs have been called as Signs of the Reappearance ('Ala'im al-Zuhur) as one of the most significant happenings of this age is the coming of the Savior. Some of these signs are: Emergence of Sufyani [12] Emergence of Sayyid al-Hasani , dispute among descendants of Abbasids over kingdom [13] Eclipse of the sun in the middle of the month of Ramadan and the eclipse of the moon at the end of it [14] Rising the Sun from the west [15] Murdering al-Nafs al-Zakiyya (the Purified Soul) [16] Destruction of Kufa mosque , Emergence of Yamani , the permissibility of shedding the blood of people and taking their property [17] Emergence of Anti-Christ (Dajjal) [18] about which it is mentioned in hadiths that he will stay for forty days after emergence [19] and many people having weak faith will turn to him and this is because of extraordinary thing he will do. [20] Emergence of wars, massacres, and obliteration of the proofs of the truth [21] Emergence of great corruptions in the world [22] Escalation of chaos and weakening of people's faith [23] Taking the positions of the management of the society by incompetent people, the obedience of men from their wives, overvaluation of the world, lack of security [24] Emergence of different mischief and trials among Arabs [25] Disappearance of modesty among women and children [26] Prevalence of usury [27] Occurrence of great massacres in the world and emergence of trials [28] Men's needlessness of women and women's needlessness of men [29] Drinking alcoholic drinks and wearing silk [30] Differences with the Signs of the Apocalypse In the Qur'an and hadiths, there is another similar term called \" Ashrat al-Sa'a \" (signs of the moment) which refers to events happening of which is a sign of approaching the Apocalypse. In many Sunni sources and some Shia hadith collections , the signs of the coming Imam al-Mahdi (a) are mixed with the signs of approaching the Apocalypse, and even sometimes the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a) itself is mentioned as a sign of the Apocalypse. Generally, authors of Sunni hadith collections have assigned a section called Ashtrat al-Sa'a and even with the content of these hadiths is so much common with the hadiths about the End Time. Many of the signs have been mentioned in both groups of hadiths. Still, the issue of the End Time has always been clearly distinguished from the Apocalypse because the End Time refers to the last age in this world, but Ashrat al-Sa'a are the signs before the Resurrection. After the Coming of the Savior After the emergence of these signs, the coming of the Savior will happen, which is among the most important events of the End Time. From the most important events after the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a), some facts can be mentioned: Fighting oppression and corruption and eradicating them [36] Saving humanity from dilemmas of sins , oppression, and corruption is among the Savior's goals which will be fulfilled at his time as Imam Ali (a) says, \"at the time of the al-Mahdi's (a) rule, the issues of adultery , drinking [alcoholic drinks] and usury will be eradicated.\" [37] Establishment of true Islam and worshiping God and monotheism in the whole world [38] Prevalence of religion [39] Acting upon religious values and merits and precise observation of religious orders and rulings [40] Establishment of security, so that the life, property, and honor of people in the society will be safe from others' violation [41] and through the Savior, routes will gain security. [42] Establishment of welfare for all people [43] so that all edible things will be accessible by human beings and people would easily use properties. [44] Development of cities in all the world [45] Development of friendship, kindness, and friendliness among all people, so that people would take as much as they need from their religious brothers' reserves without any problem. [46] Perfection of intellects and human's readiness for benefiting from divine teachings. [47] Perfection and developments in science and knowledge in all aspects and benefiting from the perfect scientific fruits by all people in the society [48] Acting upon the Book of God and the conduct of the Prophet (s) [49] These are among the events happening at the time of the Savior and are considered among the characteristics of this age. Coming of Jesus (a) According to hadiths, one of the important happenings of the time of the coming of the Savior is the coming of Prophet Jesus (a) from skies. From these hadiths, it can be learned that the Prophet Jesus (a) will participate in the world uprising of the End Time and comes from the skies to establish justice but under the flag of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and would not be independent. Jesus (a) will come down on the land of Palestine and will greet Imam al-Mahdi (a) and will pray behind him and help him in killing Anti-Christ (Dajjal). Raj'a Raj'a (the return) is among other important events in the golden age of the world after the coming of the Savior and his actions. Raj'a refers to the return to life of given past historical figures, from some righteous and some bad people, after their physical death. In Other Religions The concept of the End Time has been mentioned in other religions in other forms as well. In Christianity Meaning Christians speak of a time when the return of Jesus (a) will happen. Coming of Messiah (a) has been mentioned in the Bible more than three hundred times and some complete chapters are about that. Jesus (a) will come again in the End Time and complete the program to rescue people. They believe that the world will meet happiness in his coming and will be in complete peace after his coming. War and bloodshed will be gone and no group will then fight another. The belief about the victory of the truth over falsehood is evident in Christian culture and the Bible and in their views, the Savior is Messiah(a). Signs For the coming of Messiah who is Jesus (a), some signs have been mentioned as following: Messiah will come when people are sinful and oppression has taken over the world. [59] \"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\" [60] \"Shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.\" [61] According to the Bible, the emergence of Anti-Christ (Dajjal) is among the events before coming the Messiah. In Judaism Meaning In Judaism , \"the last days\" or \"the Day of Yahweh (the Lord)\" have been mentioned in many cases, referring to the time when the glory of Jews will reach its peak and sinners will perish and a king of Jesse's (David's father) descent upon whom the spirit of God is and is wise and God-wary will come and will fill the world with justice, goodness and blessings , as then \"the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the young goat.\" The Day of the Lord is when the course of history will reach its peak and perfection. Events before the Coming of Mashiach: There will be bloody wars at the time of the coming of Messiah due to political unrest. As it has been said that, \"whenever you see that governments engage in war with each other, expect the steps of Mashiach, because at the time of Prophet Abraham (a) it happened so and when the states engaged in war with each other, Abraham (a) came to save.\" Coming of Mashiach will be together with great difficulties. Before his coming chaos and corruption in the world will reach their peak and life's difficulties will be almost unbearable. These conflicts and wars among states of the world are called wars of Gog and Magog . Events after Coming of Mashiach The happenings of the time of Mashiach are: Cure of the sick [69] Trees bearing abundant fruits [70] Reconstruction of the ruins [71] Reconstruction of Jerusalem al-Quds [72] Establishment of peace throughout the nature [73] Disappearing crying in the world [74] Disappearing death in the world [75] In Zoroastrianism In Zoroastrianism , the coming of a savior at the End Time has been mentioned as well. In Zoroastrianism, this issue has been mentioned in a certain way according to their beliefs. They believe that a cosmological power or \"spirit of good\" called Ahura Mazda and an opposite cosmological power or great spirit of evil called Ahriman exist. During history, these two powers fight each other until the End Time when the good defeat the evil and a period of peace, purity, and promotion of Ahura Mazda will come and with the coming Saoshyant , the End Time comes. In one of the clauses of Gathas, which are the compositions of Zarathusthra (Zoroaster), there is a mention of a man who will come in the future and find the way of saving. Also in Gatha, in some places, the name Saoshyant has been mentioned who is the savior in Zoroastrianism. The term Frashokereti (final renovation of the universe) is another term mentioned in Gatha and refers to the End Time, when after weakness and then the destruction of Ahriman and its forces, the universe returns to its original perfection (Gatha Yasna Vahat). Thus, Saoshyant is the person who will come at the end of the world and is called the victor Saoshyant and also astvat-әrәta (from whose life, all humans become immortal). In Avesta, the word Saoshyant has been mentioned at least eight times and astvat-әrәta at least twice. Events after the Coming of Saoshyant One of the actions of this promised savior after his coming is the renovation of the universe and eradication of evil and darkness. The companions of this promised savior have been described as thinking good, speaking good, doing good and having good religion, and never tell lies.

{"title": "Divine Reward and Punishment", "text": " Divine reward and punishment or al-Thawāb wa l-ʿiqāb (Arabic: الثواب و العقاب ), are two Qur'anic terms for good and bad deeds of human. \"Thawab\" is the reward which God grants to His faithful servants in return for their faith and good deeds. \"'Iqab\" is the punishment that an unbeliever or a sinner receives for his unbelief or unlawful and sinful deeds. Among the most important issues discussed about reward and punishment are the essentiality of faith for reward, whether it is given in return for a behavior or as a mere grace of God, the place of receiving reward and punishment, and the issue of embodiment of actions . Reward and punishment are a proof of human's free will; since without free will, there must be no reward for a good deed or a punishment for a bad one. Extensive discussions are held regarding the topic in Islamic theology , philosophy , mysticism , and the principles of jurisprudence . Meaning \"Thawab\" is an Arabic term. The root of the word means to return to a previous status. It is roughly an equivalent of \"reward\" in English. The technical meaning of thawab is the reward that God grants to the faithful in return for their righteous deeds. The root of the word \"'iqab\" means to follow something and go after it. In its technical sense, this term means the punishment and penalty that a person receives for his unbelief or practical sins. In the Qur'an and Exegeses The words \"thawab\" and \"'iqab\" and their derivatives are used 13 and 20 times respectively. In addition to these words, other terms are used, such as \"Ajr\" for the faithful and \"Jaza'\" for the unbelievers, or pairs such as \"tarhib and targhib,\" (frightening and encouraging) \"bishara and indhar\" (giving good news and warning) or \"wa'd and wa'id.\" Exegetes , following theologians, consider reward as a gain emanating from aptness and qualification (not only God's grace), given with respect and admiration (not just as a repay), and punishment as a deserved loss and harm, received with humiliation. Abu l-Futuh al-Razi claims that the difference between 'adhab and 'iqab is that 'iqab is always deserved, but not 'adhab. According to several verses of the Qur'an , even the smallest actions of people are recorded in \"Kitab\" and saved, and on the Day of Resurrection it is presented to them. Therefore, Kitab, which is sometimes referred to as the letter or the booklet of deeds, and some explanations have been provided by exegetes for the presentation of human actions. 'Allama Tabataba'i argues that what is saved in Kitab is the essence of the actions itself, rather than its written form as it is usual in this world. However, most of the exegetes described Kitab as a written being. Additionally, some believe that the booklet includes the amount of reward and punishment as well, and some state that people will receive reward and punishment justly according to their deeds recorded in Kitab. Seeing the Deeds There are different opinions among exegetes about the meaning of seeing the deeds in the Hereafter : Seeing the requital of deeds, seeing the booklet of deeds, receiving reward or punishment, seeing the essence of the deeds - according to the theory of embodiment of deeds - and knowing and true perception of what was done in this world. According to the 40th verse of Qur'an 53 \"and his endeavor soon will be seen\" 'Allama Tabataba'i says that probably one's deed is shown to him and other people. Embodiment of Actions There are two types of Qur'anic verses regarding reward and punishment: The ones indicating that reward and punishment are different from human actions; and Heaven is the reward for the good people; and Hell is the punishment for the sinners. The ones implying the embodiment of deed and the unity of deed and its requital on the Day of Resurrection. Many exegetes believe that these verses are metaphorical or figurative and phrases such as \"the presence of deeds on the final day\" are actually referring to the consequences and the booklet of deeds. On the other hand, 'Allama Tabataba'i believes that these two sets of verses could be literal and needless of any justification metaphorically or figuratively. He states that each of these two groups of verses is considering one aspect of the deeds in the Hereafter. Proportionality between Requital and Deed Proportionality between the requital and the action is another issue mentioned in the verses regarding reward and punishment. Some verses state clearly that on the Day of Resurrection humans are rewarded and punished exactly equal to their good and bad deeds. In others, the punishments fully match the sins, but considering God's grace, the reward of good deeds is more and better than the deeds. There is not much disagreement among the exegetes in explaining these verses. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , because of His grace, God compensates the deficiency of humans' good deeds and rewards them based on the best of their actions. The increase in the reward of good deeds are different in Qur'anic verses: several times, ten times, seven hundred times, and \"without reckoning.\" Exegetes give different explanations on the meaning of \"without reckoning\" some of which are as follows: God's reward is countless and in other words eternal, God's reward is beyond what the faithful deserve; nobody questions God about how much He rewards, nor he expect anything in return; God's rewards come from His endless fountain of grace and generosity. Faith, Condition of Reward According to some verses, faith is the condition of receiving reward; therefore, the good actions of the unfaithful or unbelievers do not deserve a reward in the Hereafter. Likewise, if the sinners who commit what equals unfaithfulness do not repent, in which case their whole faith is ruined, they do not receive any rewards. To explain this, exegetes indicate that actions like unbelief and apostasy negate the effect of the past good deeds in gaining eternal salvation, while faith is the enabling cause of good deeds' effects (such as receiving reward) in the Hereafter. On the other hand, some verses state that faith, repentance and good deeds (such as compulsory prayers, hajj , piety , refraining from major sins ) will wash away sins ( Takfir in its Qur'anic sense). In this World and in the Hereafter The Qur'an has mentioned the reward of this world in contrast with the reward of the Hereafter and the people who only seek the reward of this world in contrast with those who seek the reward of the Hereafter. According to Qur'anic verses, both rewards are in God's hands. He gives the reward of this world to its seekers and they do not receive anything in the Hereafter, while He gives both rewards to the seekers of the reward of the Hereafter. Explaining these verses, exegetes of the Qur'an have said that according to the context and occasion of revelation , the reward of this world means the war booty of the Battle of Uhud and generally everything that one enjoys and take advantage of in this world including: money, conquest in battle, honor, fame and so on. The reward of the Hereafter is the honor before God, high status in the Hereafter, Heaven and its blessings, forgiveness of God and so on. According to al-Tabrisi , calling the rewards of this world as \"thawab\" is a figurative usage. 'Allama Tabataba'i has said that using the adjective \"fair\" (husn) for the reward of the Hereafter (the verse read: \"So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the fair reward of the Hereafter\" Qur'an 2:148) and not using the same adjective for the reward of this world shows the high value of the reward of the Hereafter in contrast with that of this world. However, there is no contradiction between the reward of this world and that of the Hereafter, rather those who only seek the reward of this world do not receive the reward of the Hereafter and those who seek the reward of the Hereafter will receive both. Severe Punishment God has promised the following people of severe punishment: who deny His signs, who change His blessings, who disbelieve, who oppose Him and His Messenger, who are lazy in responding when He and His Apostle summon them and who disobey His rulings in Hajj. In Hadiths In Shi'a hadith sources the terms thawab and 'iqab have been used very much. There are several chapters related to this topic in the Four Books and many hadiths have been narrated explaining the reward and the punishment of various actions (form the reward of believing in Tawhid to the reward of minor good deeds and from the punishment of polytheism to the punishment of minor sins). Among Shi'a and Sunni hadiths, hadiths about reward are more than hadiths about punishment. According to the Qur'an and hadiths, only the faithful receive the reward of their good deeds in the hereafter and unbelievers will not receive anything in the hereafter. In many hadiths the reward of ziyara of Infallible Imams (a) is compared to that of fighting and martyrdom or the reward mentioned for fulfilling a need of a faithful person is fulfillment of one hundred prayers, one of which is going to Heaven or forgiving of all sins and if death occurs in that moment, entering Heaven and receiving eternal reward. It is also narrated that if someone makes the heart of a faithful person happy, not only does God make his heart happy in the hereafter, but also gives him what he wishes and even more than he wished that he could not imagine. Moreover, it is mentioned that the reward of taking care of an orphan is being with Prophet Muhammad (s) in the heaven and the reward of helping widows or the needy is like the reward of fighting on the way of God. By referring to hadiths it can be inferred that the amount of reward depends on several factors, such as: the importance of that action, the knowledge of the doer, his/her intention , place and time of action. Likewise, the amount of punishment changes by some factors, such as the lineage of the doer, as it is narrated that the descendants of Lady Fatima (s) who become obdurate and do not recognize the right of the infallible Imams (a) will face a double punishment. Among Shi'a Muhaddiths (narrators), al-Shaykh al-Saduq has given a considerable attention to the topic of reward and punishment by compiling a book titled as thawab al-a'mal wa 'iqab al-a'mal (the reward of the deeds and the punishment of the deeds). The terms thawab and 'iqab and their derivatives are rarely used in Sunni narrated hadiths, however some compilers and commentators of Sihah al-Sitta (the Six Authentic (books)) have used the terms in the title of some chapters in their books. The term \"Jaza'\" (requital) is also used about both reward and punishment. Sometimes in narrations the terms thawab and Jaza' are used interchangeably. Place of Receiving Various Qur'anic verses and hadiths talk about the stage in which reward and punishment starts for a person. People receive rewards of some good deeds and punishment of some sins in this world, however the true place of reckoning and reward and punishment is the hereafter in which the most minor good or bad deeds are reckoned and requited. Although all Muslims believe in the punishment in the grave , there are disagreement about those who receive reward or punishment in their graves. According to some hadiths reward and punishment in grave is only for the pure faithful of pure unbeliever, while other people will be requited in the Hereafter. In Islamic Philosophy and Mysticism In Islamic philosophy and mysticism , more than reward and punishment, the terms happiness and wretchedness were emphasized and it was tried to change the meaning of reward and punishment to happiness and wretchedness; even sometimes the asceticism and worshiping acts of non-mystic for receiving reward was counted as a kind of transaction. Philosophers usually have explained the religious concept of salvation by the term happiness. Reality of Reward and Punishment in Philosophy Among philosophers, happiness involves a kind of spiritual joy which is nothing except for perception and attainment of perfection and good; so the greatest happiness is most perception and the happiest human is the most successful one to attain good. Mulla Sadra explicitly said, the hereafter, which is the realm of reward and punishment, is a perceptional world. It should be noted that for Mulla Sadra perception and knowledge are grades of existence, or even they are existence itself. Muslim philosophers mostly considered reward and punishment as a necessary and inevitable consequence of one's deeds. According to Mulla Sadra, just as inappropriate foods cause illness of the body, wrong ideas and bad deeds cause illness of the spirit. According to Avicenna , there is no great evil in this world and if there is evil, it is little. Some of this little evil is from human being, but this evil is a necessity of their essence and they cannot be created without this little evil. Reality of Reward and Punishment in Mysticism Similar points can be found in Islamic mysticism. Ibn 'Arabi believes, it is the knowledge and negligence of human to his essence that makes him felicitous or wretched, and the essence of human is nothing except for Haqq (Truth) and its manifestation. Heaven, which Ibn 'Arabi calls Dar al-Sa'ada (the house of happiness), is an idea hidden in every one's essence, which is nothing except for real truth, and entering Heaven means returning to this idea and finding the true attributes manifested in it. Therefore, happiness means knowing God and the essential unity of existence and wretchedness is deprivation of this knowledge; the only criterion for happiness and wretchedness is knowledge. According to Ibn 'Arabi there is no external punisher or rewarder, rather punishments and rewards are the existential (Takwini) results of one's deeds. In Theology There are two mainstreams in explaining the teaching of reward and punishment in theological sources: 'Adliyya ( Imamiyya and Mu'tazila ) who discussed this topic in the chapter of Divine justice and the chapter of Resurrection (Ma'ad), and Ash'aris and Maturidis who discussed it only in the chapter of Resurrection (Ma'ad). Entitlement or Divine Grace Most of Mu'tazila argued that each person is entitled to reward and punishment as a result of his deeds. On the other hand, Ash'aris and Maturidis did not accept that. They believed that reward is Divine grace and punishment is Divine justice . Rejecting the rational good and bad (al-Husn wa l-Qubh al-'Aqli), they believed that nothing is obligatory for God and His justice is nothing except for His authority over His properties; He is the master and whatever He does is good and proper, rewarding or punishing. Shi'a theologians believe that the theory of entitlement cannot be proven by reason, rather it is proven by the Qur'an and hadiths . Eternity Mu'tazila and some of Shi'a theologians, such as Khwajih Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , believe that reason can justify eternality of reward and punishment; however, most of Shi'a scholars believe that there is no rational reason for proving that, rather the only proof for eternality of reward and punishment is the Qur'anic verses and hadiths. Major Sins Mu'tazila consider the committer of major sins as Fasiq (evil-doer) and entitled to eternal punishment. Shi'a theologian do not agree with that opinion, as they believe there is no rational reason proving it, also, it is possible that God pardons a committer of major sins and does not punish him. Factors that Reject Reward and Punishment According to Islamic theologians, there are several factors that reject Thwab and 'iqab. There are disagreements between Shi'a, Mu'tazila and Ash'aris about these factors. The most controversial factors are as following: Divine Pardon Shi'a and Mu'tazila of Basra believe that forgiving Fasiq or Kafir by God is rationally good (al-Hasan al-'Aqli), because He has the right to punish them and if He renounce it, His servant receives a benefit and there is no bad (Qubh). Ash'aris believe it is rationally possible that God forgives major sins, although it cannot be said that He will do so. Some of them said that God does not forgive some major sins, which we do not know. On the contrary, Mu'tazila of Baghdad believe that God does not pardon who are entitled to punishment. Ihbat and Takfir Mu'tazila believed in Ihbat and Takfir , which mean everyone's sins is compared to his good deeds, if his sins are more than his good deeds, the sins remove the good deeds and he would be entitled to punishment for remaining sins (Ihbat) and if the good deeds are more than sins, some good deeds are taken as atonement for the sins and due to remaining good deeds the person would be entitled to thawab (Takfir). Shi'a and Ash'aris do not accept the theory of Ihbat and Takfir. As Ash'aris believed that reward and punishment is not entitlement and nothing is obligatory for God, they rejected the theory of Ihbat and Takfir. According to Shi'a theology, committing a sin does not prevent a faithful Muslim from going to Heaven and does not entitle him to eternal Hell, because he is entitled to eternal reward for his faith; therefore, he would be temporarily punished for his sins. Repentance Another factor that dismisses punishment is repentance . The effective time for repentance is when the sinner still has the ability to commit the sin. Most of Mu'tazila believe that only major sins need repentance and the good deeds will atone for minor ones. Dismissing punishment by repentance does not mean the reward of repentance is added to other rewards and they atone for sins, rather repentance by itself cause dismissing of punishment. Ash'aris do not count repentance by itself as a factor of dismissing punishment. Intercession Mu'tazila did not believe in intercession of Prophet Muhammad (s) as a factor of dismissing punishment, rather as an extra reward. Ash'aris believed that intercession only applies to committers of major sins. According to Shi'a beliefs, Shafa'a, under specific conditions, erases sins (major and minor) or elevates the person, if he has no sins, through the grades of Heaven. Relation between Free Will and Reward and Punishment 'Adliyya (Shi'a and Mu'tazila) theologians counted reward and punishment as a sign of human free will . They argued that if human being do not have free will in his actions, praising or blaming him and rewarding or punishing him is unreasonable and unjust, while commanding him to do something was irrational, as he did not have free will in his actions. However, by presenting the theory of Kasb, Ash'aris said that reward and punishment are \"'Adat Allah\" (God's habit) and are not signs of free will. Theologians have linked the concepts of \"thawab and 'iqab\" with \"praising and blaming\" (Madh and Dhamm), therefore these topics have been tied to the more fundamental issues of Good and Bad (Husn and Qubh). In Usul al-Fiqh Shi'a scholars of principle of jurisprudence have tried in their works to define \"Good and Bad\" by the concept of thawab and 'iqab, and thereby they linked one of the most important ethical concepts to a jurisprudential one. Contrary to the majority of Shi'a scholars, Mirza Muhammad Husayn Na'ini questioned the theory of Entitlement and argued that because human being are God's servant, they must obey Him and it is not rationally prohibited that a master give rewards to his obedient servants; basically, reward is God's grace upon His servants. Mirza Shirazi accepted the theory of Entitlement and added that not giving reward to one who is entitled to it is bad (Qabih). But it should be noted that Mirza Shirazi, contrary to theologians, believes that independent reason does not see an act of obedience entitled to benefits and profits, rather only entitled to proximity to God; the benefits and profits are divine grace, though. According to his viewpoint, independent reason realizes that a sinner is entitled to punishment; however, forgiving him is good (Hasan). The theory of Entitlement is very popular among Shi'a scholars of principles of jurisprudence ; however, a group of them along with some Muslim philosophers accepted the theory of Embodiment of Actions (Tajassum al-A'mal). The advocates of this theory believe that reward and punishment are not inevitably and necessarily a result of deeds, rather in fact they are nothing but manifestation of the reality and essence of one's deeds. In other words, in the Hereafter evil deeds are embodied as fire of the Hell and good deeds are embodied as blessings in Heaven. Scholars of Usul have mentioned that the intention of obedience and compliance or the intention of proximity to God is a necessary requirement for entitlement to reward, and without that no deed is entitled to reward. Undesirability of Punishment without Prior Infroming/Warning This is an Usuli rule meaning that from the viewpoint of the reason, God does not punish human being for disobeying a ruling that was not expressed by Him, as it would be unjust, and He never do injustice. Scholars of Usul believe that what entitles a person to punishment is disobedience to God's commands; but as disobeying a command that is not expressed is rationally impossible, expressing and stating the ruling is a necessary requirement for entitlement to punishment. Other than expressing the ruling, it must be delivered to Mukallaf , in a way that if he tries to find that ruling he could reach it.

{"title": "Evil Eye", "text": "Evil Eye is a damage to humans or other beings thought to be caused by being looked at by a person. The notion does not explicitly occur in the Qur'an , but the majority of Quranic exegetes believe that Wa In Yakad Verse was revealed about the evil eye. There are hadiths which are explicit about the reality of evil eyes, providing recommendations for protection against them, including the recitation of al-Mu'awwidhatayn , Qur'an 2 (sura al-Baqara), al-Kursi Verse and Wa In Yakad Verse. The Notion The evil eye is a damage to a human person or other animals and objects thought to be caused by being looked at by some evil-eyed person. The evil eye is a non-volitional state arising from a feeling of envy for a person's happiness, success, beauty, admiration, and the like. Some people believe that the evil eye is an effect of one's psychological faculties. The evil eye is closely tied to envy, and in some hadiths, envy is said to be the origin of evil eyes. According to al-Allama al-Majlisi , some exegetes of the Qur'an take the verse 5 of Qur'an 113 in which the envy of envious people is mentioned to be about evil eyes. The Reality of Evil Eye In the Qur'an There is no explicit word in the Qur'an which means evil eye, but many exegetes of the Qur'an take the verse Qur'an 68:51 , “ Indeed the faithless almost devour you with their eyes when they hear this Reminder, and they say, ‘He is indeed crazy. ” to imply the existence of evil eyes. With regard to the occasion of the revelation of this verse, it is said that polytheists had asked an evil-eyed man to cast an evil eye on the Prophet (s) . When the man decided to do so, Jabra'il (Gabriel) revealed Wa In Yakad Verse , thereby protecting the Prophet (s) from the evil eye. However, there are other exegetes who do not take the verb, \"izlaq\", to be meant \"to have an evil eye\", taking it, instead, to mean to look at someone with hostility and harshness. They say that in this verse, the word is used in this meaning. Some exegetes of the Qur'an take the verse 67 of Qur'an 12 to be concerned with the evil eye. In their exegesis of the verse, \"And he said, 'My sons, do not enter by one gate, but enter by separate gates\" , they say that since the Prophet Jacob (a) 's sons were handsome, numerous, and strong, he recommended them to enter Egypt from different gates lest they are hit by an evil eye. However, al-Shaykh al-Tusi has pointed to other exegetic accounts of the verse provided by those who deny the evil eye in the Qur'an. They propose other possible accounts such as the fear from being hurt by governmental agents. Ayatullah Ma'rifat appealed to the next verse in which it is said that \"it (that is, Jacob's (a) plan) did not avail\" (or did not work), in order to show that Jacob's (a) recommendation was not concerned with evil eyes. In Hadiths According to hadiths cited in both Shiite and Sunni sources, evil eyes are real. There is a hadith that says, \"If something could overcome the predestination , it would be the evil eye.\" Hadiths from Shiite Imams (a) have also been explicit on its reality and have proposed ways to protect one against it. Some Views In his Sharh al-isharat , Nasir al-Din al-Tusi says that Ibn Sina believed that evil eyes were not certain (rather they only probably existed). But Mulla Sadra maintained that some souls come to a degree of power in their \"estimative faculty\" (al-quwwa al-wahmiyya) that they can exert their influence on external matters, and evil eyes are of this category. Also, there are some scientists who believe that there is a magnetic force in the eye that can be strengthened through training. Relationship with Predestination Template:Mian Some people take the idea of evil eyes to be contrary to the doctrine of predestination (al-qada' wa l-qadar) and trust in God . This has led to questions and answers with regard to evil eyes. According to Shiite scholars, evil eye does not contradict the divine Power , because what has the influence is God's Power, not such factors. Also, the hadith in which the effect of evil eye is taken to be equal to the predestination is taken to be exaggerative . Such a conception is rooted in hadiths in which the evil eye is confirmed; hadiths such as \"an evil eye can lead a man to the grave and a camel to the furnace\" and \"if graves are dug, you will see that most of the dead had died because of an evil eye\". Jurisprudential Ruling There is no discussion of the evil eye in Shiite jurisprudential books, and no jurisprudential rulings have been inferred from hadiths in this regard. However, it is said that in some areas in North Africa, if it is proved that a famously evil-eyed person damages someone or something with his or her evil eye, then they will have to compensate for the losses. It is also said that some Sunni jurists issued rulings on famously evil-eyed people, such as preventing them from interacting with people, keeping them in their homes, and allocating an allowance for them from the public treasury . Protection from the Evil Eye Ta'widh and hirz are used for protection against the evil eye. In supplications transmitted from Shiite Imams (a) , they asked God to protect them from the evil eye. Imam al-Sajjad (a) asked this from God in the 23rd supplication of al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya . Shiite hadiths have recommended the recitation of al-Mu'awwidhatayn , al-Kursi Verse and Wa In Yakad Verse for protection against evil eyes. According to a hadith from the Imam al-Rida (a) , the recitation of Qur'an 2 (sura al-Baqara) and al-Mu'awwidhatayn is recommended for neutralizing the effect of an evil eye. Imam al-Rida (a) was quoted as saying that a written form of Qur'an 1 (Sura al-Hamd), al-Mu'awwidhatayn, and al-Kursi Verse should be put in a glass contained for protection against evil eyes. Also, Shiite Imams (a) are quoted as saying that it is recommended to mention God whenever something makes you wonder; for example, say dhikrs such as Takbir , Hawqala , and [[Ma Sha' Allah]. Supplication for Neutralizing the Effect of an Evil Eye In some books, certain supplications are cited for protection from evil eye, such as: اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ مَطَرٍ حَابِسٍ وَ حَجَرٍ يَابِسٍ وَ لَيْلٍ دَامِسٍ وَ رَطْبٍ وَ يَابِسٍ رُدَّ عَيْنَ الْعَيْنِ عَلَيْهِ فِي كَيْدِهِ وَ نَحْرِهِ وَ مَالِهِ فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرى‏ مِنْ فُطُورٍ ثُمَّ ارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنْقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ الْبَصَرُ خاسِئاً وَ هُوَ حَسِيرٌ \"O God! The Lord of protective rain and dry stone and dark night and moist and dry! Return the [evil] eye of an eye to him in his trick and his camels and his property. Look again! Do you see any flaw? Look again, once more. Your look will return to you humbled and weary.\" Folk Beliefs There are different ways to neutralize the effect of evil eye in different cultures. In some Asian areas, it is widely believed that burning peganum harmala (esfand or aspand) and breaking egg are good for counteracting evil eyes. However, there is nothing in religious sources to confirm such practices; thus, some people take it to be superstitious. Also, blue beads are used as bracelets, necklaces, or adornments hanging from walls and the like in order to protect one against evil eye, but according to fatwas of some marja's , there is no jurisprudential evidence for this practice. Evil Eyes in Other Religions Followers of pre-Islamic religions also believe in evil eye. It is said that the Jews considered 99 percent of deaths to be caused by evil eye. Arabs in the Age of Ignorance did not restrict evil eye to humans; they believed that some animals could also have evil eyes, and they deployed different tricks to protect themselves against evil eyes. For instance, when someone came to have 1000 camels, he blinded the eyes of his best camel. Before Arabs, the same beliefs were held by Semitic and Indo-Aryan people. Notes References"}
{"title": "Caliphate", "text": "Khilāfa (Arabic: خِلافَة , caliphate) is a political-religious term which refers to the succession of the Prophet (s) in political, governmental and religious matters. According to Shiites , the succession of the Prophet (s) extends to both mundane and afterlife matters, and the Prophet's (s) caliphs are Twelve Imams (a) from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the only difference between them and the Prophet (s) being that God does not make any revelation to them. After the demise of the Prophet (s), the official caliph [except for the short term rule of Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Hasan (a) ] was undertaken by non-infallibles (people who were not ma'sum ). For about 13 centuries, numerous persons and dynasties occupied this position, introducing themselves as successors, that is, caliphs of the Prophet (s). In historical terms, caliphate is a structure of government in terms of which the administration of the Islamic community took shape after the demise of the Prophet (s), and its occupant, who is called 'Khalifa' or 'caliph', counts as the Prophet's (s) successor in the Islamic government. Meaning The Arabic word \"Khilafa\" is originated in the root of \"kh-l-f\" (Arabic: خ‌ ل‌ ف ) which denotes succession, and the word \"Khalifa\" ( خَلیفَة , plural: Khulafa' خُلَفاء and Khala'if خَلائِف ) means successor or surrogate. The words \"Khalifa\", \"Khulafa\" and \"Khala'if\" have been used in the Qur'an in just this literal meaning. In the wake of the demise of the Prophet (s) followed by political developments, the words \"Khilafa\" and \"Khalifa\" were used to refer to the political succession of the Prophet (s) in governing the Islamic community, or any Islamic government after the demise of the Prophet (s). Such uses have turned these words into key notions of the political culture of Muslims, and some people tried to ground the legitimacy of the political system of Khilafa or caliphate in the use of the word \"Khalifa\" in the Qur'an. The words imamate and Imam have also been used in the work of early Muslim authors in the same meaning, which is different from what Shi'as mean by the words. History In the historical approach, caliphate is a structure of government in terms of which the administration of the Islamic community after the demise of the Prophet (s) took shape, and its occupant, the Khalifa or caliph, counts as the Prophet's (s) successor in the Islamic government. Event of Saqifa Bani Sa'ida The formation of caliphate dates back to an assembly in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida in which a group of companions sought to determine the Prophet's (s) successor immediately after his demise. The architects of caliphate as a political system seem to have had a remarkable grasp of the system, which is the origin of the most important ideas about caliphate that left a profound impact on the subsequent views of Muslims. The assembly in Saqifa displayed the strong influence of the pre-Islamic cultural and social traditions of Arabs on the formation of the structure of an Islamic government. Conditions of Caliph The founders of the caliphate emphasized that the caliph should be from Quraysh , thereby making the tribal approach the most significant basis of the caliphate. Given its consistency with the cultural and social life of Arab people, the approach received wide acceptance. It was in line with such an approach that Al-Abbas b. Abd al-Muttalib , the Prophet's (s) uncle, emphasized the family inheritance of caliphate, and Abu Sufyan opposed the rule of a low-ranking kinsman of Quraysh, that is Taym , the tribe of Abu Bakr . In spite of this, there were still people at that time who did not subscribe to such a notion of the Prophet's (s) succession. Opponents Given their crucial contribution to the progress of Islam , Ansar (the helpers)) wanted a ruler from themselves with the same position as the ruler from Quraysh. Ahl al-Bayt , some people of Banu Hashim , as well as some of companions , opposed the assembly in Saqifa. They did not recognize the notion of the caliphate as assumed by parties in the Saqifa meeting. Instead, they refused to accept what was later known as the religious and mundane authority of the caliph as the successor of the Prophet (s), taking it to be a privileged feature of an Imam who is appointed by God and the Prophet (s). Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa The system of the caliphate was established by choosing Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa as the first successor of the Prophet (s), though the choice was later known as \"Falta\" (Arabic: فَلتة , lit. a sudden, snap and unexpected event) by 'Umar b. Khattab . Since the decision was opposed by many of Companions, Banu Hashim and in particular, Ahl al-Bayt (a) , it was difficult to make people pledge allegiance for the caliph. Since the legitimacy of the new government did not seem obtainable except through people pledging their allegiance to the \"caliph\", proponents of the new government tried to get people to pledge their allegiance in whatever ways they could. While oppositions to the First Caliph were so frequent that he once decided to resign from power, the most important opponents were quenched in different ways in order to keep the First Caliph in power. He was called 'Khalifat Rasul Allah' (the successor of the Prophet (s)). Abu Bakr is the first of Rashidun Caliphs , and the procedure for his election as a caliph is the ground of the theory of ahl al-hall wa l-'aqd (people of solution and convention) in the political jurisprudence of Sunni Muslims. Abu Bakr's practice during his two years of caliphate unveils his broad conception of the caliphate as the successor of the Prophet (s) in religious and mundane matters. Performance All the authorities and powers of the Prophet (s) were conferred to the caliph, the only difference being the sources of their powers. Such a conception of the caliphate was exhibited most obviously when Abu Bakr declared that Muslims who refuse to pay their zakat to him are apostates (Murtadd). He was so strict in his reaction to these people that other Muslims objected to him. In fact, unlike the early statements of Abu Bakr as taking himself to be equal with other Muslims, asking people to enjoin the right (Amr bi l-ma'ruf) on him and forbid him from the wrong (Nahy 'an al-munkar) and obey him only insofar as he is on the right path of God, his performance during his caliphate displayed an authoritarian character, not only extending to the broad area of the caliph's authorities, but also to his preferences for the Quraysh tribe to which he belonged. He explicitly declared his preference for Quraysh and even in practice, he did not punish some criminals who were from this tribe, such as Khalid b. Walid . Umar b. al-Khattab A short time before his death ( 13 /634), Abu Bakr appointed 'Umar b. al-Khattab as his successor and obligated Muslims to pledge their allegiances to him. He has been reported as having said that the reason for such an appointment was to prevent riots ( fitna ) in the Islamic community. It is not clearly known what he meant by 'riot', but insofar as the structure of caliphate is concerned, this reveals the lack of any unified approach to the selection or election of the caliph—the selection being subject to personal interests and preferences—which opened the way for the inheritability of the caliphate, turning it into the sultanate. Since Abu Bakr was called the Prophet 's (s) successor, and 'Umar b. al-Khattab was Abu Bakr's successor, he was called \"Khalifat Khalifat Rasul Allah\" (Arabic: خليفة خليفة رسول الله , the successor of the successor of the Prophet (s)), but he preferred to be called \" Amir al-Mu'minin \" (the ruler of the believers), instead. The title, Amir al-Mu'minin, remained the most popular and the most significant title for caliphs until the end of the age of caliphate. At the time of the second caliph, widespread changes were made in different dimensions of the emerging Islamic community, exhibiting an extension in the notion of caliphate, especially in its religious aspects. This view is supported by changes made by the caliph in some traditions of the Prophet (s) or some Islamic laws. Performance As a caliph, 'Umar took his authorities and power to be equal to those of the Prophet (s). Such a view was sometimes given a religious profile. While such a view came to be accepted among Arab Muslims, it gave rise to some worries even among the agents of the government. Even Umar himself was concerned that caliph would turn into a king or a sultan, despite his inflexible thoughts regarding the wide authorities of the caliph. Such worries were reinforced by his taking the election of Abu Bakr to have been sudden, that Abu Bakr took power without Muslims being consulted, and his different practice in selecting his own successor. However, such worries remained just that, since some of his governmental policies, such as his attempts to approximate the structure of caliphate to that of standard governments of that time, left serious impacts in the Islamic community; policies such as the constant propagation of the view that Arabs are superior to other ethnic groups ('Ajam) in contrary to the Prophet's (s) explicit anti-racist views, discrimination among people in their shares of the governmental treasury (Arabic: بیت المال , Bayt al-Mal , or the finance house), and the abolition of an equal sharing of war booties. Appointing the Council of Caliphate Umar left the election of his successor to a six-member council constituted by the Prophet's (s) companions . It seems that this was not his initial opinion since according to some reports, he frequently expressed his preference to appoint some of companions, who were not alive at that time, as his successors. These remarks, together with his views about the subsequent caliph, express his doubts in this regard. But he finally found it more practical to leave the decision to a council. The council was not independent enough in its election, since all its six members were from Quraysh and since they were required to elect the caliph from among themselves, the tribal approaches to the election of the caliph (emphasizing the superiority of Quraysh) would persist. Though the council resolved the problem of finding a successor for the Second Caliph, it turned into a new problem—because of raising new claims concerning caliphate—that deepened the disputes among Muslims. 'Uthman b. 'Affan 'Uthman b. 'Affan took power in 23 /643-4 or 24 /644-5. He was given the pledge for allegiance (Bay'a) on the condition that he acts upon the Qur'an and the Prophet's (s) tradition, and most importantly, follow the practice of the previous caliphs (called ' Shaykhayn ', the two old men). Imam 'Ali (a) refused to accept the latter condition, and 'Uthman himself did not remain committed to it. In fact, though his conception of the position of caliphate and its authorities was similar to that of his predecessors, his governmental policies were unexpectedly radical and deconstructive. Performance Some actions, such as appointing some people who were banished from the Islamic community by the Prophet (s) to important governmental positions, assigning important governmental affairs to Banu Umayya , and donations to some people, especially people of Banu Umayya, from the Islamic treasury, were in direct contradiction with the dominant conception of caliphate among Muslims. Though these took place in the last years of Uthman's caliphate, it was heralded by some of his approaches in the first days of his rule. It has been reported that, after 'Uthman received people's Bay'a, Abu Sufyan called him to return to pre-Islamic criteria, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf called him the supporter of Banu Umayya. Formation of Formal Ceremonies Some of 'Uthman's early practices were evidence of his different approach. It is reported that on the first night of his caliphate, when he went to the mosque to say prayers , some people with candles in their hands walked ahead, which was a sort of formal ceremony. And unlike the previous two caliphs who always sat below the Prophet's (s) seat on the minbar , he sat on the Prophet's (s) seat. According to al-Ya'qubi , he later called the custodian of the treasury his own custodian, which shows his tendency to treat the treasury as his own personal property. And this is what underwrites his donations to people from the treasury. And when his opponents asked him to resign from power, he rejected their request on the basis of the argument that God has given him the position. Such a conception was reinforced by 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar by saying to 'Uthman that \"[caliphate is] a cloth that God has put on you\". The fact that such conceptions of caliphate gave rise to serious objections and oppositions among Muslims, and in particular among the Prophet's (s) companions, is evidence that they were at odds with the concept of caliphate most Muslims had in mind then. Other characteristics The most important actions of 'Uthman that gave rise to objections include: not observing the rights, changing the laws of the Qur'an , increasing his personal wealth by the support of the public treasury, overlooking people's criticisms and their enjoining him the good (al-Amr bi l-ma'ruf) and forbidding him the wrong (al-Nahy 'an al-munkar), tendency to pre-Islamic traditions such as tribalism, instead of Islamic values, e.g. giving more power to Banu Umayya and in particular Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan , and overlooking the unjust behaviors of his agents with people. Murder of the Third Caliph When the Third Caliph overlooked frequent objections of people, Muslims asked for his resignation and punishment. Though the request was unprecedented, it shows that caliphate was, for people at that time, a position that may be subject to criticisms, and it is, on this conception, legitimate insofar as it is in accordance with the Islamic values, and it can persist only if people consent to it. Therefore, on this conception, if a caliph were not practically committed to religious laws, people had the right to object to him, remove him from power, and even rise against him. The Third Caliph was killed after a public riot. The event revealed a deep division among Muslims. There were two influential tendencies among Muslims: idealists who could not overlook any deviations in the caliphate from Islam, and some wealthy people who were only concerned with their mundane interests. At this point in history, social circumstances led to the victory of idealists and the election of Imam 'Ali (a) as the next caliph. Ali b. Abi Talib (a) Election People pledged their allegiance with 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) when, unlike the previous three caliphs, there was no particular procedure for his election and 'Uthman had not proposed any such procedures for the election of his successor. This was the result of the particular social and political circumstances of Muslims at that time. In these circumstances, the Third Caliph did not have the time and chance for proposing procedures for the election of the next caliph, nor was it feasible for Muslims to apply the previous methods. Thus the protesters who went to Medina found that the only legitimate way to elect the next caliph was a direct consultation to public opinions, and they finally agreed on the election of Imam 'Ali (a) as the caliph because of his numerous virtues. In spite of his own preferences to be an advisor, rather than a leader, Imam 'Ali (a) found it wrong to reject people's requests. In particular, he accepted to undertake the position because for him, the ultimate goal of a government was to maintain justice, and this was what people wanted then. Allegiance People pledged their allegiance (Bay'a) to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) on the condition of acting upon the Qur'an and the Prophet 's (s) tradition. He did not make the allegiance compulsory on the grounds that he was only obligated to call people to follow him, rather than coercing them to do so. Al-Iskafi has reported another allegiance that Imam 'Ali's (a) followers (Shi'as) made in order to befriend his friends and hate his enemies. This shows that the boundaries of Shi'a was being more clear-cut at that time. Performance Circumstances of caliphate in the period of Imam 'Ali (a) were distinct from those in the periods of his predecessors, both because of several political crises in which he was engaged from the very beginning, and because of his radically different approach to caliphate from the established, orthodox approach. One underlying reason for such a difference in approach was his rejection of Islamic caliphate both in its origination and its persistence—acquiescing it only out of exigence—but the most important reason underwriting such an approach of his was his firm belief that he himself was the immediate successor of the Prophet (s) both in political power and his spiritual position. Therefore, he was the elected leader of people and not only a caliph—a notion totally at odds with the system of caliphate. It is obvious that such a conception had particular consequences and implications for his conception of a government. Guidance in the Framework of the Divine Mission Unlike his predecessors, his religious leadership was not based on free ijtihad in modifying the Quranic laws and the tradition of the Prophet (s), but was in the framework of his divine mission, without taking himself equal to the Prophet (s) with respect to legislation. Political and Economic Dimensions In political and economic respects, like the religious ones, he followed the principles of the Prophet (s), including: Refusing from any coercion and oppression with respect to allegiance as well as his treatment of people who broke their allegiances ( Nakithun ) or people who disobeyed him. Undertaking the task of informing people of the right and wrong, both in public and in encounters with enemies—even those who drew their swords against him. Refusing to take military measures as much as possible. Determined combat against class, tribal and racist discriminations that were institutionalized during 25 years of the previous caliphs, and full commitment to justice. Conveyance of the Prophet's (s) Intellectual and Practical Tradition Imam 'Ali's main concern during the period of his caliphate was to convey the Prophet's (s) intellectual and practical tradition to people most of whom had forgotten, or were unfamiliar with, it; in fact, there was the fear that the essence of Islam was going to be dis-remembered. This is why he took the teaching of religion to be a main task of a government. He was determined to erect the flag of faith and inform them of halal (permissible) and haram (forbidden). The fact was even acknowledged by those of the Prophet's (s) companions who were still alive at that time. Problems of Imam 'Ali's (a) Government Because of such a conception of the government, Imam Ali 's (a) government encountered numerous problems, the most important of which were the occurrence of three civil wars during 4 years and branching of some Muslims into a different religious sect. There was once again a riot against the Caliph requesting his resignation. This time, without holding any talks or negotiations with the caliph, the riots announced his removal from power and, instead of a sit-in in the center of caliphate, they killed people. Unlike 'Uthman , Imam 'Ali (a), who believed in the effectiveness of dialogues, invited them to hold negotiations and make compromises, though to no avail. And whenever there was a military action, he first talked with them with reasoning and arguments and invited them to rethink their positions. The defeat of Khawarij in this battle could quench their riot since they had no foothold among people, but social and political diversities of that time left no opportunity for Imam 'Ali (a) to go on his reforms, and soon he was martyred by some Khawarij. al-Hasan b. Ali (a) Imam 'Ali's (a) martyrdom in 40 /661 complicated the critical circumstances of caliphate—in addition to political troubles, the geographical borders of caliphate were in danger, since Mu'awiya had declared the independence of Syria and Egypt from the center of caliphate. People nominated Imam 'Ali's (a) son, al-Hasan (a) for caliphate, since they deemed him to be competent to continue Imam 'Ali's (a) path. However, Imam 'Ali (a) left it to people to choose the next caliph. The election of Imam al-Hasan (a) as a caliph is evidence that some of Imam Ali's (a) doctrines were established among people. This is supported by the fact that people pledged their allegiance to Imam al-Hasan (a) on the condition that he acts upon the Qur'an and the Prophet's (s) tradition . Separation of Caliphate from Sultanate Later in one of his sermons, Imam al-Hasan (a) made a clear distinction between caliphate and sultanate in that the former has to be in accordance with the Qur'an and the Prophet's (s) tradition and should be based on justice. At that time, in Syria, Mu'awiya, who was an old enemy of Islam before the Conquest of Mecca and was appointed as the governor of Syria by the Second Caliph , was making a serious attempt to turn caliphate into sultanate, and of this Imam al-Hasan (a) and many Muslims were fully aware. That is why Imam al-Hasan's (a) priority, during his leadership, was to resist such attempts. Mu'awiya as the Rival of Caliphate The governmental system of Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan in Syria was a rival to the central caliphate. This was not resisted before Imam Ali's (a) caliphate, since Umar and Uthman who had appointed Mu'awiya as their agent in Syria, found it necessary to support him. However, Imam Ali (a) did not agree with this; he believed, instead, that the presence of Mu'awiya in power is pernicious for the Islamic nation, and this was why he took measures to remove him from power. Compromise with Mu'awiya Imam al-Hasan (a) tried to resist Mu'awiya, but the complicated predicaments of that time left him no choice other than to make a compromise with Mu'awiya. Thus six months after his election as the caliph, when there was an attempt to assassinate him, he resigned from caliphate and made a compromise or a peace treaty with Mu'awiya . According to al-Baladhuri , one of Imam al-Hasan's (a) conditions in his peace treaty was that Mu'awiya should not choose his successor on his own and should leave it, instead, to Muslims. Moreover, he is said to have disagreed with Mu'awiya's suggestion to overtake caliphate after him. These two positions reflect Imam al-Hasan's (a) worries about Mu'awiya's attempts to establish an inherited sultanate. These worries were soon confirmed, since on the very day when Imam al-Hasan's (a) peace treaty was signed, in a public speech Mu'awiya said that all his attempts were directed at establishing his power. Features of Rashidun Caliphs Imam al-Hasan (a) was the last caliph in the first chain of the Islamic Caliphate. He was one of the caliphs that came to be called Rashidun Caliphs who have had charismatic characters among later Sunni Muslims (Shia Muslims have a different view). Such a conception that can clearly be found in the work of Sunni authors of different periods, such as the fact that they were among the distinguished class of the Prophet 's (s) companions , their kinship with the Prophet (s) either by blood or by marriage , their early conversion to Islam, their assistance of the Prophet (s) in his goals, and their practical tradition (with the exception of the Third Caliph ). These features underpinned a significant difference between them and the later caliphs, and, above this, they turned into yardsticks against which the performance of political leaders in the Islamic community was evaluated. Governmental Approach of Rashidun Caliphs Their governmental approach was the basis on which some of the most important political and governmental laws of Sunni Muslims were founded. The following are some theories of this type in Sunni jurisprudence : Opinions of ahl al-hall wa l-'aqd (people of solutions and conventions) Principle of counseling (Shawra) Caliph should be from Quraysh Role of allegiance (Bay'a) as an expression of one's assent to a caliph Obligation of obeying the ruler and the prohibition of rising against him Permissibility or impermissibility of evicting a caliph Fighting with riots against a caliph. These are derived from the practice of Rashidun Caliphs as models of an Islamic government. Umayyad Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan The establishment of Umayyad Chaliphate in 41 /661-2 led to a legitimacy crisis for the Islamic caliphate. Mu'awiya was a caliph who was not seen by Muslims as similar to previous caliphs—he was not even well-reputed. In fact, most Muslims found it unbelievable to pledge their allegiance to him as a caliph, and this is why people of Kufa were coerced to pledge their allegiance to him. Even Mu'awiya himself stated that he had not seized caliphate with consent, rather by force. Ways of Legitimizing His Caliphate Mu'awiya had at his disposal some procedures to prove himself as a legitimate caliph. According to al-Jahiz, Mu'awiya called the year in which people pledged their allegiance to him \"the Year of Consensus\" ('Am al-Jama'a), that is, the year of consensus over one caliph. This was a widely accepted principle at that time that a caliph is legitimized by people's consensus. This is why some Sahaba refused to pledge their allegiance to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) in order to break consensus over his caliphate—ignoring another widely accepted principle at that time according to which a person agreed upon by people of al-Haramayn (that is, Mecca and Medina ), Muhajirun and Ansar is the caliph, which was exemplified in the case of Imam 'Ali (a). Such a pretext—that was later known, in the political fiqh of Sunni Muslims, as the principle of \"the rule of the dominant\"—was key to the legitimization of governments during the time of Mu'awiya and his successors, with which opponents were oppressed. The main goal of Mu'awaiya, as made explicit in his inauguration speech, was to turn caliphate into sultanate. He later called himself a king, declaring the end of caliphate. However, he finally came to see that he had better keep the titles of \"Khalifa\" (caliph) and \" Amir al-Mu'minin \" (ruler of the believers) for himself. Such a contradiction, though acceptable by his proponents in Syria who had been calling him \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" for a long time, wasn't so acceptable for others; but it was still believable since they used to conceive of Mu'awiya as the Kasra (King) of Arabs. It was obvious that the king of Arabs could not be similar to previous caliphs. He took himself to have the permission to deal with the Muslim treasury as his personal property and he even called himself the successor (Khalifa) of God and the king of God (Sultan Allah). He took his government to be a divine privilege for his own kinsman. This turned into a dominant view leading to the inheritance of caliphate among Banu Umayya , and turning the notion of Islamic caliphate into an Islamic sultanate. This was supported and confirmed by a hadith attributed to the Prophet (s) that \"there will be 30 years of caliphate and then there will be sultanate\". The Islamic aspect of such sultanate was the title \"Amir al-Mu'minin\", in addition to some superficial manifestations of Islam, such as moving the Prophet's (s) minbar and cane to Syria . Also, the title \"Sultan Allah\" (the King of God) was used to terrorize and oppress people. Such an approach—of terrorizing people—was key to establish Yazid as the caliph deputy. Yazid b. Mu'awiya The notion of caliph deputy or surrogate—which introduced the notion of an inherited crown prince in the structure of caliphate—implied that caliphate should continue among Banu Umayya , as it implied the demolition of the Islamic aspect of caliphate (especially with respect to the character of the caliph). However, things deteriorated when the caliph deputy became a caliph in 60 /679-80 he ignored all Islamic values and oppressed all opposition with violent force. In this period Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions were called \"Khariji\" (that is, outsiders of the religion), and people of Medina were forced to choose between death and pledging their allegiance to Yazid as slaves whose lives and properties were under the authority of the caliph. And in order to oppress al-Zubayris , they set Ka'ba to fire. This meant that the legitimacy of the caliph was no longer measured against his commitment to Islam; rather he was deemed as the yardstick of right and wrong. Even the rightest action, after testifying the oneness of God, was deemed to be the oppression of the caliph's opponents. However, uprisings such as Harra , Tawwabun and the uprising of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi , shows that such a conception of caliphate, though widespread, had serious opponents. In addition to the household of the Prophet (s) who expressed their position in the Battle of Karbala , some groups of Muslims, especially people of Mecca and Medina and Iraq expressed their opposition to such a conception. The arguments they made and the criteria they had for a desirable caliph are evidence of there being a strong intellectual movement whose adherents sought to put the caliphate back to its right track. One of these opponents who later claimed to be a caliph was 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr . 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr Though 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr did not rise as a caliph, he had such a claim a long time before that. After the death of Yazid in 64 /683-4, he called people to pledge their allegiance to him on the condition of acting upon the Qur'an , the Prophet's (s) tradition, and the practice of Rashidun Caliphs . This call was a return to the original form of caliphate as a political ideal. After the resignation of Mu'awiya b. Yazid from caliphate and the crises of Umayyad government, his caliphate went beyond Hijaz , where it began. Banu Marwan The caliphate of Banu Marwan began from 64 /683-4 and continued until 132 /749-50 with ten caliphs. They continued the Mu'awiya's heritage of sultanate and raised the spiritual authority of the caliph. A caliph as conceived by Banu Marwan was deemed as sacred, as manifested in titles such as \"Khalifat Allah fi l-Ard\" (God's successor on the Earth), \"Amin Allah\" (God's trustee), \"Ra'i Allah fi l-Ard\" (God's guardian on the Earth), \"Wali l-Haqq\" (the warden of the right), \"Wali 'Ahd Allah\" (the warden of God's promise), \"Imam al-Huda\" (the leader of guidance), \"al-Imam al-Mubarak\" (the blessed leader), and \"Khayar Allah li-l-Nas\" (God's choice for people). There were some people within the caliphate system that propagated such conceptions, such as those who fabricated some hadiths , especially poets who expressed a lot of sacred notions concerning caliphs. Hajjaj is quoted as using expressions such as the \"shadow of God\" or \"infallible both in speech and in practice by God's leave\" with respect to caliphs, claiming that wahy was still revealed to caliphs. It is indubitable that this approach had political purposes since under such conceptions it would be religiously legitimate to oppress the opponents. Opponents Shias , and groups of Muslims who were political proponents of Imam 'Ali (a) and his progeny, expressed their opposition to such a notion of caliphate by defending the uprisings of 'Alawis (as being qualified more than anyone else for the realization of Islamic ideals). Some of these people were attracted to the slogan of Banu 'Abbas , that is, \"the consent of the Prophet's (s) progeny\". They helped Banu 'Abbas, hoping that the caliphate comes back to the Prophet's (s) progeny. Things were different with 'Alawis. Some of them (Shiite Imams from the progeny of al-Husayn b. Ali (a) ) remained immune to the oppression of Banu Umayya , because they avoided public political and military activities, though they made attempts to propagate anti-caliphate ideas. Thus they could establish the intellectual and religious framework for Imamiyya Shiism. On the contrary, other groups of 'Alawis, such as Zaydis , took military action to be the best possible solution to oppose Banu Umayya. They had no success during the Umayyad period, because of strong oppressions, but they managed to establish governments in different parts of the Islamic world, though not always as caliphate. View of Khawarij Khawarij had a different position. They emphasized that caliphate was not restricted to Quraysh and this led to their deep political conflict with the standard idea of caliphate. They believed that every righteous, knowledgeable and brave Muslim could occupy caliphate. Even some of them believed that non-Arab Muslims and women could be caliphs. According to such a belief, they had their own non-Quraysh rulers who were called \"Amir al-Mu'minin\". They always conflicted with other Muslims with military action. Their rulers were elected by public appointments, and in case they deviated from religion or committed Major Sins , their followers could evict or kill them. More branching inside Khawarij and their dispersion in different areas of the Islamic world led to changes in their conception of the notion of caliphate. For instance, Najadat, a branch of Khawarij, rejected the need to an Imam or caliph if there is equality in the human community. According to this theory, Imamate or caliphate is not religiously obligatory, and when there is no need, it is not an obligation. Another branch of Khawarij, called 'Ajarida, believed that there can be two Imams or caliphs at the same time. Among Muslims Despite such diversity and plurality of views regarding the notion of caliphate, the political dominance and widespread propagations of Banu Umayya led to the prevalence of their conception of caliphate among Muslims in general, even after the Umayyad period. However, Banu Umayya themselves were not well-reputed among the majority of Muslims (both in their own time and later), because of the religious and political illegitimacy of their governments and their cruel treatments of the Prophet 's (s) Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Thus some Muslim authors refused to use the title \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" or \"Khalifa\" for Banu Umayya or appealed to the hadith according to which there will be thirty years of caliphate and then sultanate, in order to exclude the Umayyad rulers from caliphate. Even the reforms of two Umayyad caliphs, 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz and Yazid b. al-Walid , or attempts of some authors to justify the practice of Umayyad caliphs, did not improve Muslims' conception of Banu Umayya. Abbasid Abbasid was the third caliphate in Islam which lasted over five centuries ( 132 /74-50 - 656 /1258) by thirty-seven caliphs. Their motto was \"Al-Rida min Al Muhammad (s)\". Taking oath of allegiance to Saffah based on retaining Ahl al-Bayt 's (a) rights and return of succession as the divine heritage of Prophet Muhammad (s) and his family was the principles of Abbasid caliphate. Based on this governing system, hierarchy was an essential principle in the structure of the Abbasid caliphate. Taking the oath of allegiance to the caliph was carried out in a special ceremony written in the second and the third century after Hijrat . Ceremonies and rituals in different aspects of caliphate were necessary requirements for caliph and caliphate system. The first generations of Abbasid caliphs were holding high religious and political authority. They were able to rule with supreme political power as they were holding religious authority. However gradually their political authority declined, even the appointment and dismissal of caliphs, the longevity of their government and their lives were almost completely in the hands of Turk, Buyid and Seljuk military officials. Abbasid dynasty was eventually overthrown by the attacks of Hulagu Khan to Baghdad in 656/1258 which led to disappointment of those who regarded caliphate sacred. Also in different regions of Islamic territory some raised and claimed to be the caliph of Muslims. Fatimid Fatimid dynasty ruled for about 270 years (from 297 /909-10 to 567 /1171-2) by fourteen caliphs. They ruled over Egypt , Maghreb and the majority of Syria . Fatimids also managed to govern Diyarbakir, Rabi'a, Hijaz and Yemen in some periods of their caliphate. The intellectual system of the Fatimid caliphate had a complex and powerful administrative structure which was based on stabilization of caliphate and promotion of their religious outlook ( Isma'ili Shi'ism) all over the Islamic territories. Therefore, the Fatimid caliph was a caliph and an Imam (based on their own special meaning of Isma'ili Imam) who were holding a high spiritual status far more than Abbasid caliphs'. Fatimid caliphs had different titles including Amir al-Mu'minin, Wali Allah, Hujjat Allah, etc. After the death of Al-Mustansir in 487/1094-5 the court of Fatimid was divided into two groups who supported Musta'li and Nizari. They were competing over the succession and caliphate which led to the division of Fatimid territories and eventually their fall. Al-'Adid the last Fatimid caliph was entirely dominated by Salah al-Din Yusuf b. Ayyub, the Sunni Sultan who supported Abbasids. Al-'Adid's death in 567/1171-2 marked the end of the Fatimid caliphate. Ottomans Ottoman sultans were ruling over Russian Steppes to the Black Sea, a region in Europe and Africa, Iraq , Hijaz and Syria; they also managed to form a strong fresh government. When Ottomans conquered Egypt in 923 /1517-8 they officially attained caliphate. The Ottoman Sultan knew if they wanted to achieve caliphate, they had to relate themselves to the Abbasid caliph in Egypt; even Sultan Salim I, who founded Ottoman Caliphate tried to announce himself as an Abbasid caliph before claiming his caliphate. As Ottoman Sultans conquered parts of Iran, Anatolia, Hijaz , Syria, and north of Africa they made efforts to achieve caliphate of Muslims over Islamic territories. After the battle of Chaldiran in 920/1514-5 in which Sultan Salim defeated Safavids, he was then called \"Caliph of God and Prophet (s)\". However, the Ottoman caliphate never had a magnificent spiritual status. As they were non-Arab and non-Quraysh, and their lineage did not go back to Prophet Muhammad (s) Ottomans failed to attain spiritual authority. Also in the first century after caliphate of the Ottomans, a prominent Ottoman official wrote a Risala in which he tried to legitimate caliph and Imam for non-Quraysh (Ottoman) Sultans; it represents the fact that legitimacy of Ottoman caliphate was under question. In 1922-3 Grand National Assembly of Ankara, limited Ottoman caliphate to a spiritual level and separated it from ruling. After a year, Sultanate was replaced with Republic ruling system and Turkey became a Republic country. It was opposed with Muslims who favored caliphate especially notable figures including Sayyid Amir Ali Hindi a Twelver Shi'a and Aqa Khan (the leader of Isma'ilism), they traveled to Turkey and held meetings with the President and the Prime minister of the time to reconsider the decision. These actions failed eventually and in 1924-5 people of Turkey voted to abolition of caliphate ruling system. New Approaches to the Problem of Caliphate In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Muslim scholars proposed different theories regarding caliphate: 'Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi (d. 1320/1902-3) was an Egyptian intellectual who adopted an ethnic approach and sought the return of caliphate to Arabs, but he was not specifically an advocate of the caliphate system, rather he was an advocate of a form of a government which was not deemed sacred and did not lead to absolute power. Thus, he restricted the power of a caliph to that of a religious leader. Sayyid Jamal al-Din Asadabadi (1254/1838-9 ; 1314/1897): he had a positive view of caliphate and, in particular, the Ottoman caliphate. This approach is relevant to his ultimate motivations and goals, that is, the unification of the Islamic world, emancipation of Muslims from their regress and ignorance, and the recovery of their power and glory against colonialism. He believed in the revival of the power of caliphate (as an axis of the unification of the Islamic world), not in its traditional form, rather in a new framework (respecting citizen rights and mutual rights of the government and people). His positive optimistic approach turned into disappointment towards the end of his life as a result of misconducts of Istanbul 's caliphate and Abd al-Hamid II (the caliph of the time). Muhammad Rashid Rida (1282/1865-6 ; 1354/1935-6): he was a strong advocate of the caliphate. He was at first a supporter of the Ottoman caliphate. However, in the wake of the separation of the Ottoman caliphate from monarchy in 1922-3 and the spread of Arabic nationalism, he turned into an opponent of the Ottoman caliphate (taking it to be a deviation from the proper system of caliphate). Thus, Rashid Rida adopted the same approach as Kawakibi's to the problem of the Arabic caliphate. 'Abd al-Razzaq Ahmad Sanhuri (1313/1895-6 ; 1391/1971-2): in an attempt to merge the system of caliphate and the independence of Muslim governments, Sanhuri proposed the establishment of Islamic international organizations. These organizations were supposed to take the place of the institution of caliphate by creating cultural relations and an ideological-cultural unification among Muslim people. In this proposal, the caliph was an honorary head of all Islamic governments with religious power and without any political power. Abu l-Kalam Azad (1305/1887-8 ; 1377/1957-8): he gave an account of the system of caliphate as a government based on the Qur'an , decisively defended such a system, and emphasized on the election of the caliph through the votes of \"Ahl al-Hall wa l-'Aqd\" (qualified people). After the collapse of the Ottoman caliphate, he turned to nationalistic views and even justified the non-religious policies of Atatürk. Abu l-A'la Mawdudi (1321/1903-4 ; 1399/1978-9): he defended the system of caliphate on the basis of an ideal theory of caliphate. However, he did not take caliphate to be restricted to the Quraysh or any other tribe, ethnicity, or group. He also considered the power of the caliph to be limited and restricted. He also emphasized the division and independence of powers in the political structure of caliphate. He took the caliph to be a representative of people, and thus, he leaned towards democracy. Others: according to Malek Bennabi, an Algerian intellectual, there was a democratic government before the Battle of Siffin . He was optimistic about the return of Muslims to the original Islamic democracy (with an emphasis on values such as freedom of speech and thought and emancipation from tyranny). However, he never talked about the revival of the system of caliphate in his work. Hasan al-Banna (1324/1906-7 ; 1368/1948-9), the leader of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , suggested a similar view in a different way. While he considered the caliphate to be a principle of Islam and a ground for the unification of the Islamic world, he highlighted the religious role of the institution of caliphate. Revive of Islamic Caliphate After the abolition of caliphate of the Ottomans, some made efforts to revive the Islamic caliphate. Mawlana Muhammadullah popularly known as Hafezzi Huzur in Bangladesh founded a movement similar to caliphate which included huge political and religious movements as he tried to revive the Islamic caliphate. Supporters of Hafezzi Huzur were politically active in Bangladesh in the 1980s which included some Islamic groups. It led to massive internal disputes between supporters of Hafezzi and the government of Bangladesh. Eventually, the leaders of Hafezzi Huzur movement were arrested and Hafezzi Huzur was put in house arrest; the activities of this movement were also restricted. In addition, Jamal al-Din b. Rashid Kablan (Khuja Ughlu) the Turkish religious scholar, declared caliphate in 1990s as the only legitimate Islamic government. It was founded based on traditional fiqh principles on caliphate as well as requirements of the modern world. Kablan's plan was almost similar to 'Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri's, the only difference was that El-Sanhuri regarded caliph as the highest administrative position in Islamic world and he emphasized on revival of traditions such as taking oath of allegiance, having Lunar calendar and exercising Shari'a laws. He also concentrated on selecting Istanbul as the spiritual capital of caliphate. ISIS is the most recent group that claimed caliphate over Islamic territories.

{"title": "Finality of Prophethood", "text": " Khātamiyya (Arabic: الخاتمية , Finality) is a theological term and one of the Qur'anic teachings that all Muslims believe in. It means that Prophet Muhammad (s) is the last prophet and Islam is the last divine religion , and there will be no religion after it, and its teachings and rules are valid forever. Khatamiyya was always an apparent and accepted belief among Muslims. As it was dealt as a certain belief among them, it was not discussed as an independent issue in theology and Islamic theologians have proved it through narrative arguments. In the last decades of the 20th and early 21 century, new discussions have been started about this issue, as Baha'i 's objections provoked theologians to defend this belief. In addition, the new approach of explaining revelation and prophethood , the issue of religious experience and revelation elevated the issue of Khatamiyya to one of the most important topics in theology. Terminology Lexical Meaning Khatamiyya in Arabic is a derivative from \"Khatm,\" which means the end. Khatam and Khatim both mean what ends something or what comes at the end or is the last. Some believe that Khatim means what ends and Khatam means a ring with engravings, which is used as a seal. Technical Meaning From the very beginning, the understanding of all Islamic sects from the concept of Khatamiyya was that Islam is the last divine religion, which must be the basis of human's faith and actions. Its laws, which are unchangeable, are valid to the Day of Resurrection . History of the Discussion Khatamiyya is an Islamic teaching presented in the Qur'an and hadiths ; thus it has a very long history in Islamic tradition. Although this issue is one of the most important theological issues and one can find implications about that in the works of many Islamic theologians, philosophers and mystics, it was not dealt with as an independent issue in early times. In the late 20th century, two factors led to independent works about this topic: Emergence of sects such as Babism and Baha'i , who claimed to have a new prophet and a new religion. Emergence of a different approach from a traditional one to religion, and questions raised by modernism which led to new special analysis about prophethood, revelation and Khatamiyya. This new approach toward this issue, which was mostly influenced by the theory of \"Religious Experience\" began by Iqbal Lahuri . The efforts of contemporaneous theologians for studying the opinions of Iqbal Lahuri led to the formation of a separate chapter in Islamic theology books and even independent works about this topic. Scholars such as Morteza Motahhari and 'Ali Shari'ati were among the first who talked about Lahuri's idea. Proofs of Khatamiyya In Islamic theology, Khatamiyya is considered an intra-religious issue, and no independent, meta-religious argument has been provided for it. The following intra-religious arguments have been offered for proving Khatamiyya: Qur'anic Proofs The term \"Khatamiyya\" is adopted from Quranic verses. The Qur'an 33 :40 explicitly used the sobriquet \"the final of prophets\" (Khatam al-Nabiyyin) to address the Prophet Muhammad (s). In addition to the above-mentioned verse , there are a set of verses that imply this notion, such as the verses that say Muhammad (s) is a prophet for all times and places, which consequently indicate that he is the last prophet. The following verses were quoted as the proofs for the generality of Prophet Muhammad's (s) mission: \"This Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may warn thereby you and whomever it may reach.\" [4] \"We did not send you except as a bearer of good news and warner to all mankind.\" 34:28 \"Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to all the worlds.\" [5] \"Say, 'O mankind! I am the Apostle of Allah to you all.\" [6] \"We did not send you but as a mercy to all the worlds.\" [7] \"It is He who has sent His Apostle with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over all religions.\" [8] \"falsehood cannot approach it [the Qur'an], from before it nor from behind it.\" [9] \"Indeed We have sent down the Reminder, and indeed We will preserve it.\" [10] From these verses, the theologians concluded that Islam is the most complete and universal religion. Islam and the Qur'an will not be abrogated or voided. Therefore, Islam is the last divine religion and Prophet Muhammad (s) is the final prophet. Narrative Proofs Many hadiths have been narrated about Khatamiyya in both Shi'a and Sunni hadith sources. Hadith al-Manzila : It is a mass-transmitted ( Mutawatir ) hadith in which the Prophet (s) explicitly says that there will be no prophet after him. Hadiths in which the Prophet (s) introduces himself as \"the final of the prophets\" or \"the last of 1000 prophets\" or more, and Ali (a) as \"the final of guardians\" (Khatam al-Awliya') or \"the last of the executors\" (Khatam al-Awsiya') of \"the last of 1000 executors.\" A hadith in which the Prophet Muhammad (s) introduces himself as the guide of all people from all races and explicitly says that the chain of the prophets ends by him. [12] Another hadith by Prophet Muhammad (s) which says: \"There is no prophet after me, no tradition (Sunna) after my tradition and no nation (Umma) after your nation. And whoever claims prophethood after me is a liar.\" [13] Moreover, in various parts of Nahj al-Balagha , Imam Ali (a) has pointed out that Prophet Muhammad (s) was the last prophet. In the first sermon Imam Ali (a) says, \" Allah sent Muhammad for fulfilling His promise and for ending the chain of prophets …\" Furthermore, another group of hadiths, which indicate that Islamic laws will not be abrogated and will last until the Day of Resurrection , confirm the notion of Khatamiyya. Imam al-Sadiq (a) is quoted, \" Halal of Muhammad is Halal until the Day of Resurrection and Haram of Muhammad is Haram until the Day of Resurrection.\" Khatamiyya in Islamic Philosophy and Mysticism Islamic philosophers have often discussed the topic of prophethood independently and provided rational arguments proving the necessity of sending prophets by God . Within these discussions, they implicitly or explicitly mentioned the subject of Khatamiyya as well. Among Islamic philosophers Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi , with a Shi'a approach, interpreted Khatamiyya as the end of legislative revelations and the end of descent of the archangel of revelation. He believed that Khatamiyya does not mean the end of divine arguments as the infallible Imams (a) are introduced by Prophet Muhammad (s) as authentic divine arguments. By differentiating between legislative prophethood and propagative prophethood, Sabzawari believed that ending the prophethood is about the legislative one. From his point of view, the Khatamiyya of Prophet Muhammad (s) has two aspects: By the emergence of Prophet Muhammad (s) all possible human virtues have reached their climax and no room was left for the emergence of another prophet. As Prophet Muhammad (s) is the best and the most important of all creatures and is the purpose of all creation after his existence the purpose of the creation was fulfilled. [18] Islamic mystics also believe in the Khatamiyya of Prophet Muhammad (s). Their interpretation of Khatamiyya is similar to those of Islamic philosophers; i.e. the legislative prophethood has ended by Prophet Muhammad (s). Philosophy of Khatamiyya One of the most important discussions about Khatamiyya is answering the question of why the chain of the prophets must end at a certain time and why Prophet Muhammad (s) must be the last of them. According to some contemporary scholars, the question is best answered by suggesting that given His far-reaching wisdom and omniscience, God knows where He places His message and where he ceases to send messages. However, Muslim scholars, and in particular contemporary intellectuals, have provided different answers to the question. Here is some wisdom for the finality of prophethood: The Protection of the Qur'an from Distortions The messages of prophets (a) before Prophet Muhammad (s) were distorted after a while. Thus, the divine wisdom required that another prophet be sent to people after the distortion of the previous prophet, so that the new prophet could call people to the right and clarify the distortions, putting the divine message back on the right track. However, since God has guaranteed the protection of the Qur'an against distortions, there is no need to send another prophet after Muhammad (s): \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian\" ( Qur'an 15 :9). Comprehensiveness and Perfection of Islam Divine religions were moving towards more perfection, with any new religion being more perfect than the previous ones, because of the constant perfection of the human understanding, knowledge, and disposition to receive more precise messages. The perfection process continued until the emergence of Islam. 'Allama Tabataba'i says, religion comes to its final stage when it includes all aspects of human needs, in which case it will not be followed by any other religion. The Qur'an refers to the perfectness of Islam: \"This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion\" ( Qur'an 5 :3). This perfectness cannot be proved in rational terms; it can only be proved through an examination of a religion's principles of beliefs and ethics . In such terms, one can examine different divine religions with respect to monotheism , resurrection , ethical system, and social principles. In all these respects, Islam has offered the most perfect and the most comprehensive plans and instructions, in such a way that human material and spiritual needs and are both met. No More Needs to Missionary Prophets One reason for new prophets being sent by God was the need for stating and propagating the details of divine rulings and the continuity of the relationship between God and people. In Islam, the need is met by the prophet (s) himself and the Infallible Imams (a) , and during the Occultation of the Twelfth Imam (a) , the elaboration of the religion, especially with respect to practical issues, is assigned to qualified scholars and mujtahids . Rational Perfection and Maturity of People Another factor contributing to the religion of the Prophet (s) being the final plan for human happiness was that the rational capacities of people had remarkably evolved during the period of the Prophet (s) in comparison with previous periods. Before this period, people were not sufficiently prepared to receive and understand a comprehensive plan. Thus, if such a comprehensive plan were sent to people from the beginning, it would be easily distorted or ignored, but this is in conflict with the wisdom behind the missions of prophets. Thus, a sufficiently long time had to pass from the beginning of the creation and less comprehensive plans had to be offered to people until they prepared for the reception of the final religion. The Qur'an also refers to the rational development and disposition as well as knowledge of people at the time of the Prophet (s) in comparison with people at the time of previous prophets. It also points to their qualification to undertake certain religious responsibilities, such as enjoining the good and forbidding the evil . It also refers to Muslims at the time of the Prophet (s) as the best people. Questions about Khatamiyya In recent decades, in the wake of intellectual and social developments and events, the issue of Khatamiyya was discussed from other perspectives. Addressing the claims of new emerging sects, such as Ahmadiyya, Qadiyaniyya, Babism and Baha'i , about Khatamiyya Muslim scholars have explained and elaborated Khatamiyya more deeply. Iqbal Lahuri was the first Muslim intellectual who discussed the issue with a new approach. It can be said that the following scholars were mostly influenced by his opinions. He believed that Prophet Muhammad (s) elevated people to a level of intellect and knowledge that they can reach supernatural and divine guidance to attain salvation and happiness without a prophet's help; so there was no need for another prophet after Prophet Muhammad (s). Influenced by the theory of the religious experience of Schleiermacher and William James, Iqbal believed that revelation is a kind of experience, and influenced by Bergson's philosophy of life, he introduced it as a matter of instinct. Accepting Auguste Conte's theory about stages of history, he believed that humankind after Prophet Muhammad (s) have reached the era of intellect and by the help of intuition they need not another prophet. Afterward, some writers and scholars, such as Murtada Mutahhari , Ali Shari'ati and 'Abd al-Karim Surush criticized his opinions and explained their own opinions in this regard. Baha'i Questions Baha'i believe that the word \"Khatam\" in the 40th verse of Qur'an 33 means \"ring\" and the verse only means that Prophet Muhammad (s) was an adornment of the prophets not the last of them. In answer to the question, it is said that in Arabic \"Khatam\" means what ends something and ring was called khatam in Arabic as Arabs used it to end their letters with their rings as a seal; so the giving interpretation is against the denotation of the verse and hence is invalid. Another question raised by Baha'i is that the same verse says Prophet Muhammad (s) is \"Khatam al-Nabiyyin\" (the last of the prophets) and not \"Khatam al-Mursalin\" (the last of the apostle), so there might be another apostle after Prophet Muhammad (s). This question is also answered by the fact that every apostle (Rasul) is a prophet (Nabi) and there was no prophet who was not an apostle of God. Therefore, the last of the prophets means the last of the apostles as well. Denial of Universality of Prophet Muhammad's Mission Providing evidence from the Qur'an, some have claimed that Prophet Muhammad (s) was sent to a particular region, i.e. \"Umm al-Qura\" (another name for Mecca ), and to particular people not to all the world. They tried to deny the generality of his mission as it is the other aspect of Khatamiyya. In answer to this question it must be said that according to different verses of the Qur'an, the mission of Prophet Muhammad (s) had various stages. First, he was ordered to call his family to Islam, then the people of his town, then the people of Hijaz and so on. Therefore, one can not argue that according to a verse of the Qur'an he was only sent to particular people and not all the world. Possibility of More Prophets Some of those who denied Khatamiyya argued that the 35th verse of Qur'an 7 implies the possibility of sending another prophet by God in the future. In answer, it is said that the verse means God has sent prophets and religions for guiding people. Moreover, the present tense in Arabic (Muduri') is not always used for future meaning. And above all, the verse expresses a conditional situation which does not mean it will happen. Here is the verse: \"O Children of Adam! If there come to you apostles from among ourselves, recounting to you My signs, then those who are Godwary and righteous will have no fear, nor will they grieve\". Return of Jesus and Khidr at the End of the Time Another question about Khatamiyya is how Prophet Muhammad (s) is the last prophet while Prophet Jesus (a) and Khidr (a) will return to the world at the End of the Time. However, the answer seems clear as Khatamiyya means there will be no new prophet with a new religion that abrogates Islam. It is reported in hadiths about this incident that they return as Muslims and practice according to Islam. Khatamiyya and Imamate According to Islamic texts, Imamate does not contradict the notion of Khatamiyya, in fact, Imamate is the continuation of prophethood. From the beginning of Islam until now, there was no disagreement that there is no contradiction between them. The main disagreement was refusing the Infallible Imams (a) as the successors of Prophet Muhammad (s). As no one has claimed that Shi'a interpretation of Imamate is not compatible with Khatamiyya, no independent study was done about this subject. However, in recent years and after the emergence of a new approach towards Khatamiyya, some Shi'a and Sunni scholars have claimed that Shi'a viewpoint about Imamate contradicts Khatamiyya.

{"title": "Ethics (Akhlaq)", "text": "Ethics or akhlāq (Arabic: أخلاق ) is a part of religion dealing with inner attributes of human beings. The term akhlaq refers to inner attributes of human being formed into habits and characteristics. It covers both good and bad dispositions as well as individual and social ethics. The Qur'an has mentioned correction of people's dispositions as the goal of the Prophet's (s) mission. In hadiths , the most important virtues are referred to as Makarim al-akhlaq (noble traits). Jami' al-sa'adat , Mi'raj al-sa'ada , Akhlaq Shubbar , and Akhlaq-i Nasiri are among the famous Shi'a books on ethics. Definition In usage, Akhlaq refers to inner attributes of human being formed into habits and characteristics. The word \"akhlaq\" covers both good and noble dispositions such as courage and chivalry and bad and ignoble dispositions such as iniquity and cowardice. Also, according to some books of ethics, akhlaq covers both individual qualities such as patience and courage and social characteristics such as humility and sacrifice. Importance Islam has considered an important position for ethics. The Qur'an considers moral concepts such as good and evil, justice and injustice, patience and doing good, important and mentions the correction of human's dispositions as the important goal of the Prophet's (s) mission . According to a hadith from Mustadrak al-wasa'il , the Prophet (s) introduced perfection of noble traits as the goal of his mission. Ayatollah Misbah Yazdi wrote, \"managing individual and social life of human being which is among the goals of religion, can only be done by following certain moral instructions. Thus, it can be said that, without ethics, religion cannot reach its objectives or provide the happiness of both worlds for human being.\" Individual and Social Ethics Some books of ethics have categorized ethics to two branches of individual and social ethics. Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi in Akhlaq dar Qur'an says, \"Some moral characteristics are only individual and can exist regardless of the society. Such characteristics are referred to as individual morals. Some others are formed in the relationships of a person with other people, and would not exist for a person living alone. Such characteristics are referred to as social morals.\" According to this book, most moral concepts belong to social morals, some of which are as follows: Longing Envy Humility Arrogance Good thought Justice Oppression Chastity Generosity Also, some moral concepts belong to individual morals such as: Patience Impatience Courage Fear Persistence Sloth Moral Virtues and Vices Most books of ethics give a list of moral virtues and vices. In these books, every moral characteristic is defined first and then, the factors which form those characteristics and their results are discussed. The methods for diagnosis of moral diseases, their cures, and also the way to achieve virtues are among other issues discussed in moral discussions. In Akhlaq Muhtashami , Nasir al-Din al-Tusi gave a list of some famous moral characteristics as below: Moral Virtues Ascesis Patience Contentment Humility Truthfulness Geniality Courage Silence Trust-Keeping Chastity Sacrifice Detachment from world Moral Vices Oppression Greed Envy Stinginess Lying Treachery Arrogance Rancor Enmity Boasting Bullying Hypocrisy Ethics in the Qur'an The word \"tazkiya\" (Arabic: تزکیة ) means \"purification of soul from moral vices and decorating it with moral virtues\" which has been considered among the goals of the Prophet's (s) mission in the Qur'an, has always been mentioned prior to education except in one verse. In the Qur'an , the existence of character is recognized as what rules the human soul; thus, when praising the Prophet (s), he (s) is considered to possess a great character. Moral System in the Qur'an Moral system mentioned in the Qur'an is a religious system and the base of its instructions is the relationship between human being and God . Human being received the primary guidance from God and has this capability to find the right path by appreciating the divine guidance. Birr (Arabic: بِرّ ; means Goodness) and taqwa (God-wariness), In the moral system of the Qur'an, are among the most important ones and are correlated: Birr which means goodness embraces all religious virtues in the Qur'anic view. [12] Taqwa is a characteristic of human soul which draws the person away from wrongdoings and draws him toward doing good. [13] In the Qur'an, many moral concepts have been mentioned, but some of them have been more emphasized: Equity and Justice Patience Mercy and compassion Doing good to parents Associating with relatives Giving to and helping the needy and orphans Keeping the promise and returning the trust Honorableness in transactions Noble Traits in the Speech of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) In hadiths , the Prophet (s) introduced the accomplishment of noble traits (Makarim al-Akhlaq) as the goal of his mission. Makarim al-Akhlaq have also been mentioned in narrations from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Thus, this concept was emphasized in moral discussions and several books on ethics have been written with this name. In replying to a question about the meaning of Makarim al-akhlaq, Imam al-Sadiq (a) mentioned examples for which as follows: \"forgiving the one who has oppressed you, making relationship with someone who has cut his relation with you, giving to someone who has withheld giving to you and telling the truth, even with it is against you.\" In another hadith, he (a) mentioned the following as the examples of Makarim al-akhlaq: having stamina in calamities, telling the truth, trust-keeping, associating with relatives , receiving guests, feeding the needy, returning goodness, observing the rights of the neighbor and observing the rights of friends and he (a) considered modesty the most important trait among them. Also, Imam Ali (a) considered keeping away from prohibited things as the way to achieve Makarim al-akhlaq. Sciences related with Akhlaq Akhlaq has been discussed using different approaches. Different sciences have had different approaches toward Akhlaq. Sciences related to Akhlaq are: Ethics: the science which studies good and bad attributes and actions and their results. Descriptive Ethics: this science describes the ethics in different schools of thought, people, nations and individuals. Education: is a science which shows the way to achieve moral virtues. Philosophy of Ethics: which studies the history, developments, goal and necessity of ethics and introduces its dignitaries. Philosophy of Akhlaq: is a science which studies fundamental issues about moral statements, such as criterion for moral values, absoluteness or relativeness of akhlaq and moral should and should not. [19] Shi'a Books on Ethics Akhlaq has been discussed in different ways among Muslims. These differences in views led to writing books having different approaches towards it including traditional, rational or philosophical, mystical or spiritual aspects and a combination of these aspects. Some famous Shi'a books on Akhlaq are: Jami' al-sa'adat written by Muhammad Mahdi Naraqi Mi'raj al-sa'ada written by Mulla Ahmad Naraqi Al-Akhlaq or Akhlaq Shubbar written by Al-Sayyid 'Abd Allah Shubbar Awsaf al-ashraf written by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi Akhlaq Nasiri written by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi Notes References Terminology Hadith Moral virtues Moral vices Books"}
{"title": "Faith", "text": " ' Imān (Arabic: إيمان ) or faith is a heartfelt belief in the teachings of the Prophet of Islam (s) and the Twelve infallible Imams (a) . Shia jurists take faith to be a necessary condition for marja's , imams of congregational prayers , judges, and receivers of zakat . According to the majority of Shiite scholars, faith is not a matter of taqlid (following someone's lead). According to Shiite theologians, faith requires the belief in the Imamate of the Infallible Imams (a) after the Prophet (s), in addition to belief in monotheism , the prophethood of the Prophet (s), Divine Justice , and resurrection . According to the Qur'an , having faith is different from having Islam , and is, indeed, of a higher degree. Moreover, faith is a matter of degrees and no one can be coerced to have faith. Many Shiite scholars believe that having Islam is more general than having faith. Thus, everyone who has faith has Islam as well, but it is not the case that everyone who has Islam has faith too. However, some Shiite scholars, such as Khwaja Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and al-Shahid al-Thani , maintain that having Islam is the same as having faith, although apparent Islam is of a lower degree than faith. Meaning In hadiths and jurisprudence , faith is used both in general and specific senses: General meaning is one's certitude of the heart about all the Prophet (s) has brought from Allah . Special meaning is to have faith in Imamate and guardianship of the twelve Imams (a) as well as the faith in its general meaning. According to this definition, all Twelver Shi'a are considered as faithful. [1] Jurists use special meaning of faith in different discussions such as ijtihad , emulation (taqlid), cleansing , prayer , khums , fasting , i'tikaf , hajj , waqf , nadhr , qada' , and witnesses . Faith in its special meaning is a religious obligation and even the most important of all obligations and acts of worship and it is the requirement for acceptance of them which is a matter of consensus among all religious authorities . It is a prerequisite for the source of emulation [the religious authority], Imam of Congregational Prayer (imam al-jama'a), one to whom zakat and khums is given, judge, witness [at the court] and the one who is going to distribute the treasure assigned by the Sharia ruler . Many religious authorities have considered faith as a prerequisite also for the one who recites the adhan (call for prayer) and one who does hajj instead of another. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid , an Imami scholar, takes faith to consist in a heartfelt belief, verbal testimony, and action in compliance with God's orders. The same view is held by al-Shafi'i , a Sunni scholar. Some Imami scholars, such as al-Sayyid al-Murtada , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani , al-Fadil al-Miqdad , and 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Lahiji , believe that faith is an act of heart. Thus, faith is a heartfelt belief in God, in the Prophet, and in the revelation. Thus, verbal testimony is not required for having faith. In Theology Theologians have different theories about the special meaning of faith (the first theory has been accepted more): Act of Heart Faith is an act of heart: according to this theory, faith is the acknowledgement of God, the Prophet (s) and what he (s) has brought from God by heart. Mu'min [the faithful] is one who has faith in the heart and declaring by the tongue is not necessary; also action is separate from faith and its fruits. This acknowledgement is different from knowledge and is in fact inclination of the heart and the volitional act based on knowledge; thus, it is possible that one knows about something but does not acknowledge that which is a volitional act of heart like Jews of Medina who, according to the Qur'an, knew that the Prophet (s) was sent by God but they did not acknowledge him, \"Those whom We have given the Book recognize him just as they recognize their sons, but a part of them indeed conceal the truth while they know.\" ( Qur'an 2 :146) Most Ash'arites , Maturidi and his followers, some Imamiyyas such as Ibn Nawbakht , al-Sayyid al-Murtada , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani , al-Fadil al-Miqdad , and Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji ] accepted this theory. Mere Acknowledgement by the Tongue Faith is the mere acknowledgment by the tongue: meaning that if one only recited shahadatayn without accepting them in the heart or practicing other obligations, he is regarded as faithful and thus a hypocrite is faithful in this world. This is the viewpoint of Kiramiyya and also attributed to some of Murji'a . Knowledge and Knowing Faith is knowledge and knowing: and everyone agrees that Jahm b. Safwan believed in this definition; however, this viewpoint has also been attributed to some others such as Najjariyya, some of Qadariyya , some of Imamiyya and Abu l-Hasan al-Ash'ari . Doing Obligations and Abandoning the Forbidden Faith is doing all the acts of worship including obligations, recommended actions and prohibiting the forbidden. Most Mu'tazilites , Khawarij and Ghulat are advocates of this definition including Abu Ali al-Juba'i , Abu Hashim al-Juba'i; but many of the Mu'tazilites of Basra believe that doing recommended actions is not a part of faith. Acknowledgment by the Heart and Admitting by the Tongue This is the opinion of some Twelver Shia scholars such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , al-'Allama al-Hilli and Shaykh Salim b. Mahfuz. Acknowledgment by the Heart and Admitting by the Tongue and Practicing Acts of Worship Faith is the acknowledgment by the heart and admitting by the tongue and practicing acts of worship. This is the viewpoint of Ahl al-Hadith (traditionists) and also some early scholars such as Ibn Mujahid, al-Shafi'i , and al-Shaykh al-Mufid from among Twelver Shi'a scholars. In Philosophy In the view of philosophers, faith is the progress of soul in the course of theoretical perfection. Although, doing obligations and abandoning the forbidden is in the progress of soul in the course of theoretical perfection but this progress is, in fact, the result of that course of theoretical perfection; thus one who is faithful is one whose faith correspond to the realities of creation. Declination of Faith One of the most important theological discussions about faith is if the faith of the faithful would decline? Most theologians have accepted the possibility of declination of the faith of the faithful, but it is said that al-Sayyid al-Murtada regarded it impossible that a true faith would decline and al-Shahid al-Thani also accepted it. Also, Al-Sayyid 'Abd Allah Shubbar believes in the separation of the two levels of the \"perfection of certainty \" and other levels, and believes that if one reaches the perfection of certainty, declination of faith would be impossible, otherwise it would be possible. Emulative Faith There is disagreement on whether emulation is appropriate for faith or it should be achieved through reasoning. Sunni scholars and also followers of Hashwids and Ta'limids accept emulated faith. But, Mu'tazilites , most of the Ash'arites , and Imamiyya (Twlever Shia) do not regard emulation in faith as sufficient and consider reasoning as required for having true faith. Even though they disagree on whether the origin of such an obligation is intellectual or traditional, where for example Mu'tazilites and Imamiyya (Twlever Shia) regarded it intellectual and Ash'arites regard it traditional. Articles of Faith In the Qur'an, the following issues are mentioned as the articles of faith: Faith in God [24] Faith in all prophets (a) [25] Faith in what was revealed from God to prophets ( divine books , etc.) [26] Faith in the Day of Resurrection [27] Faith in angels [28] Faith in the Unseen [29] The important point is that the above articles of faith are inseparable, meaning that one would either believe in all of that and he will be faithful, or he is not faithful whether he believes in some of them or he does not believe in any of that. The Qur'an refers to this for example in \"But those who have faith in Allah and His apostles and make no distinction between any of them —them He will soon give their rewards, and Allah is All-forgiving, All-merciful.\" ( Qur'an 4 :152) and \"Those who disbelieve in Allah and His apostles and seek to separate Allah from His apostles, and say, 'We believe in some and disbelieve in some' and seek to take a way in between (150) it is they who are truly faithless...\" (Qur'an 4:150, 151) Fruits and Requirements Faith is different from Islam and is at a level higher than that [30] True faith accompanies the great love of God. [31] God brings the faithful out of darkness into light. [32] In many verses of the Qur'an, after praising faith, doing \"righteous acts\" by the righteous ones is mentioned so that their necessary connection is understood from it. True faith is that can increase or decrease. [33] Believers' hearts finds rest in faith. [34] The faithful are fortified with an \"immutable word\" (firm saying) by God in their worldly life. [35] Satan has no authority over the believers who have not accepted his guardianship. [36] The Qur'an is a guidance and healing for believers. [37] God made faith beloved and beautiful in believers' hearts. [38] God's descent of composure into the hearts of the faithful enhances their faith. [39] The faithful are those whose hearts tremble [with awe] when Allah is mentioned. [40] The faithful when tested are jolted with a severe agitation. [41] No one would become faithful through compulsion. [42] Despite the Prophet's (s) eagerness, most people will not have faith. [43] The words \"mu'min\" (one who is faithful), \"mu'minun\" (the faithful) and their attributes are mentioned in the Qur'an suggesting that the faithful is a special group of people, and their lifestyle is completely different from the non-faithful. They live having a completely different worldview, thoughts, manners, and habits. Their motive in life is formed in their promise to God. However, the faithful people are not immaculate and sinless people. In different verses of the Qur'an, the faithful have been heeded about their sins and mistakes and they have been asked to correct themselves. Principles of Faith Shi'a theologians believe that believing in unity , divine justice , the Prophet (s) and Imamate of infallible Imams (a) after the Prophet (s), and the hereafter are requirements of faith. In the viewpoint of Mu'tazilites , essential requirements of faith are unity, divine justice, prophethood of the Prophet (s), reward and punishment , and enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong . In the viewpoint of Ash'arites , believing in the Prophet (s) for what we know he (s) has brought for certain such as the unity of God, obligation of daily prayers , general acknowledgement of what is known generally and detailed acknowledgement of what is known in details; and in the viewpoint of Hanafites , faith requires belief in God, angels , divine books , prophets and the Day of Judgment . Relation of Islam and Iman Another issue about faith is the relation between Islam and Iman [faith]: Islam and faith are one: Mu'tazilites, [50] many of Khawarij , Zaydis , [51] Hanafites, [52] al-Shaykh al-Tusi [53] and al-Tabrisi among Imamiyya, believe in this opinion. Islam and faith are different: most of the Imamiyya [54] and Ash'arites [55] believe in this opinion. They believe that Islam is more general than faith and every faithful person is Muslim but every Muslim is not necessarily faithful. True Islam and Iman are one, but superficial Islam is different from faith and is more general than that. This is the opinion of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , [56] al-Shahid al-Thani , [57] and al-Taftazani. [58] According to Allama Tabataba'i , a contemporary Shiite philosopher and exegete , both having Islam and having Islam are of varying degrees, and any degree of having Islam is a prerequisite for obtaining the next degree of having faith. Thus, the first degree of having Islam is to accept apparent divine commands and prohibitions, and then the first degree of faith is heartfelt belief in the content of Shahadatayn, which leads to acting upon ancillary Islamic rulings.

{"title": "Heaven", "text": "Heaven or al-Janna (Arabic: الجنة ) is, according to Muslims , a place in the Afterlife where righteous and prosperous people will reside and enjoy divine blessings. The place where Adam (a) and Eve lived before their fall (hubut) to the Earth, is also referred to as \"al-Janna\". There are over two hundred verses of the Qur'an as well as many hadiths from the Infallibles (a) with regard to the Heaven and its features, such as its vastness, the number of Heavens, variety and features of its blessings, things in the Heaven, the purpose of the creation, the characteristics of its residents, characters and actions that make one deserve to reside in the Heaven, people who are deprived of the Heaven, and the relationship between residents of the Heaven. Although the belief in the Heaven is a crucial Islamic doctrine, there are disagreements among Muslim theologians over whether the Heaven will be created in the Afterlife or it is already created. Moreover, Muslim scholars, both Shi'as and Sunnis , dispute over whether the Heaven and its blessings are corporeal or spiritual. The Notion and Related Terms The Heaven is a place in the Afterlife where righteous and prosperous people will reside and enjoy divine blessings. In Qur'an There are over two hundred Qur'anic verses and many hadiths from the Infallibles (a) with regard to the Heaven. Here are the themes of Qur'anic verses regarding the Heaven: features of the Heaven, its main characteristics, the vastness and the type of its space, variety of its blessings, features of its blessings, purpose of the creation of the Heaven, what makes people deserve the Heaven, what deprives people of the Heaven, and finally, the relationship between the residents of the Heaven. In addition to emphasizing the end of the world and occurrence of the resurrection and the beginning of a new life in the Afterlife , the Qur'an refers to the Heaven in different ways: 1-\"Jannat\" (literally meaning the garden; its plural form is: \"Jannāt\", الجنات ): it has occurred over 100 times in the Qur'an. It is sometimes used with another noun or adjective, such as \"Jannat al-Khuld\" ( جنّة الخلد , the Garden of Eternity), \"Jannat al-Na'im\" ( جنة النعیم , the Garden of Bliss), \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\" ( جنّة المأوی , the Garden of Abode), \"Jannāt 'Adn\" ( جنّاتُ عدن , Gardens of Eden), and \"Jannāt al-Firdaws\" ( جنّات الفردوس , Gardens of Paradise). 2-\"Rawḍa\" ( روضة , Garden): in Qur'an 30 :15. 3-\"Rawḍāt al-Jannāt\" ( روضات الجنات , Meadows of Gardens): in Qur'an 42 :22. 4-\"Firdaws\" ( فردوس , Paradise): in Qur'an 23 :11. 5-\"Dār al-Salām\" ( دارالسلام , Home of Peace): in Qur'an 6 :127 and Qur'an 10 :25. It is a name and a feature of the Heaven. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, since \"Salam\" (Peace) is a Divine Name, \"Dar al-Salam\" means the Home of God , which shows the value of the Heaven. 6-\"Dār al-Ākhira\" ( دارالآخرة , Home of the Hereafter ): it occurs nine times in the Qur'an. 7-\"Dār al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , Home of Eternity): in Qur'an 41 :28. 8-\"Dār al-Muqāma\" ( دارَالْمُقامه , Home of Everlasting Dwelling): in Qur'an 35 :35. 9-\"Dār al-Qarār\" ( دارُالْقرار , Enduring Home): in Qur'an 40 :39. 10-\"Dār al-Muttaqīn\" ( دارُالْمتّقین , Home of the Pious): in Qur'an 16 :30. 11-\"Maqām 'Amīn\" ( مَقامٍ امین , Secure Place): in Qur'an 44 :51. 12-\"Maq'ad Sidq\" ( مقعدِ صدق , Seat of Truth): in Qur'an 54 :55. 13-\"'Illīyyūn/'Illīyyīn\" ( علّیین/ علّیون , High Place): in Qur'an 83 :18-19. 14-\"Ḥusnā\" ( حُسنی , the Best): in Qur'an 10 :26 and other verses. Abd Allah b. Abbas is quoted as saying that each of the phrases, \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\", \"Jannat al-Na'im\", \"Dar al-Khuld\" or \"Jannat al-Khuld\", \"Dar al-Salam\", \"Jannat al-Firdaws\", \"Janna 'Adn\" and \"Dar al-Jalal\" refers to a particular heaven. In his collection of hadiths, Bihar al-anwar , al-Allama al-Majlisi cited Qur'anic verses concerning \"Jannat\" (which are about 275) in the order of the Qur'anic suras , and then cited their exegeses from al-Tabrisi , al-Fakhr al-Razi , and al-Baydawi . In Hadiths In some hadiths from the Infallibles (a) , the names of the Heaven in the Qur'an are explained; for example: 1-According to a hadith from the Prophet Muhammad (s) , \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\" is the name of a river in the Heaven. And \"Jannat 'Adn\" and \"Jannat al-Firdaws\" are names of two heavens in the middle of two other heavens. 2-According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the Qur'an has mentioned four heavens; Jannat 'Adn, Firdaws, Na'im, and Ma'wa, while there are many heavens around these four heavens. 3-According to a hadith transmitted by Su'ayd b. Janah from Imam al-Baqir (a), the Qur'an 55 :46 and 62, are evidences for the existence of four heavens. One of the two heavens in the former verse is a reward for abstaining from sins , and the other is a result of fearing to stand before God (people who are very close to God) and the two heavens referred to in Qur'an 55:62 (Na'im and Ma'wa) belong to Companions of the Right Hand : these heavens are closer to God, though there is less bliss there. 4-According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Qur'an 55:62 is evidence for there being numerous heavens, and the term, \"darajāt\" (degrees), reveals differences between residents of the Heaven with respect to their rankings. 5-According to some Shiite and Sunni hadiths, there is a heaven which is directly created by God and its trees are directly planted by Him; its sceneries are never seen by anyone and its bliss is not known by anyone. Some exegetes of the Qur'an take the verse seventeen of Qur'an 32 to refer to this heaven. In a hadith, Imam al-Sadiq (a) talked about God's manifestation for residents of the Heaven and then referred to this particular heaven. There are hadiths in many Shiite and Sunni collections to the effect that there is a heaven whose bounties are beyond human imaginations. Features and Characteristics Some features of the Heaven are mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) . According to the Qur'an, the Heaven is a place where prosperous people reside in the Afterlife : gardens with many green and dense trees with rivers streaming beneath them, springs, various fruits, and a moderate temperature. According to the Qur'an 3 :133 and the Qur'an 57 :21, the Heaven is as wide as the skies and the Earth. Exegetes of the Qur'an such as al-Tabrisi , al-Fakhr al-Razi and Allama Tabataba'i , have appealed to these verses to show that it is beyond the human mind to conceive the vastness of the Heaven. The Heaven is Corporeal and already Created Some hadiths have pointed out that the Heaven is created before the occurrence of the resurrection . It has been known as a Shiite belief. There is a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) according to which the Heaven is created in the sense that it has an external existence, and that the Prophet (s) saw the real Heaven in his Mi'raj . Thus, if someone rejects that the Heaven is created, they will thereby deny the Prophet (s). Some hadiths have emphasized that for every person there is a specific, predetermined place in the Heaven as well as in the Hell . A person's actions gradually build up that place in the Heaven or the Hell during time. Such hadiths have been appealed to for the existence of the Heaven and the Hell right now. The Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) emphasize that the Heaven, and in general, the Afterlife, are corporeal or physical. Thus, there is no difference between this mundane world and the Afterlife with respect to their being physical. They are different in other respects. Al-Allama al-Majlisi and Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri have appealed to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) to show that the states of the Afterlife should be measured with those of this world. They maintain that this doctrine implies the corporeality of the Heaven. In response to a question by 'Imran al-Sabi and as an argument for the invisibility of God for human beings in the Heaven, Imam al-Rida (a) said that one can argue for what happens in the Heaven only by what happens in this world. According to the interpretation of al-Allama al-Majlisi and his student, Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri, this implies the principle that the states of the Afterlife should be measured with those of this world. Theological Arguments In order to show that the Heaven is created, scholars have appealed to some verses of the Qur'an : the Qur'an 53 :5 which is a report of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj , the Qur'an 3 :133 and the Qur'an 57 :21 both of which state that the Heaven is \"prepared\", and the Qur'an 9 :100 which says that God has prepared the Heaven, and thus implies that the Heaven and the Hell actually exist right now. In some hadiths from the Imams of Shi'a , it is explicitly stated that the Heaven already exists. Imam al-Rida (a) has appealed to the story of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj to show its existence. Ibn Hazm and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya have also appealed to some accounts of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj to show that the Heaven is already created. On the contrary, people who believe that the Heaven and the Hell are not created yet have appealed to rational and transmitted evidence. The oldest rational argument is that it is vain to create the Heaven before the resurrection. Some theologians have replied to this argument by saying that the reason for all God's actions need not be known for people, and thus, we cannot hold that the creation of the Heaven before the resurrection is vain from our own perspectives. Esoteric Interpretation of the Corporeal Heaven in the Batini View In accordance with their philosophical methodology, the Batiniyya have provided esoteric interpretations ( ta'wil ) of Qur'anic verses which imply the corporeality, and other features, of the Heaven, taking them to be symbolic. In an explicit objection to them, al-Ghazali maintained that this approach implies that the Prophet (s) was ignorant or, at least, their approach is at odds with the explicit text of the religion and is, thus, against Islam , especially because there are many Qur'anic verses regarding the Heaven and the Afterlife. It has been assumed that the belief in the existence of the Heaven with the features mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths is an essential component of Islam, and thus, the interpretation of Qur'anic verses in a way that leads to the denial of the Heaven's corporeality amounts to the denial of Islam. Muslim theologians do not permit any esoteric interpretation or symbolic construal of religious texts, such as the corporeality of the Heaven in the Qur'an, except when there is a rational dilemma. Sulayman b. Salih al-Ghusn holds that doctrines, such as the corporeality of the Heaven, are rationally plausible and there is a transmitted agreement over them, and thus, it is not permissible to provide an esoteric interpretation of them which leads, say, to the denial of the Heaven's corporeality. The Blessings In the Islamic culture, Divine Satisfaction and His happiness is considered as the highest blessing of the Heaven. Moreover, many various blessings, such as foods, drinks, houses, gardens, palaces, clothes, and the like, have been mentioned in different suras of the Qur'an, such as Qur'an 55 , Qur'an 56 , Qur'an 76 , and some verses of other suras . Divine Satisfaction: According to Islamic hadiths , Divine Satisfaction is the highest blessing of the Heaven. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) to the effect that when people of the Heaven begin to reside in their places, they are told that beyond the blessings they are given is the Divine Satisfaction and His love of them. After this, Imam Ali (a) cited the verse 72 of Qur'an 9 according to which, \"what is greater than all of this is that God is pleased with them\". According to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , the least blessed people in the Heaven are those who are concerned with the bliss of the Heaven, and the most blessed—who are very valuable for God—are those who are concerned with the Divine Presence or Face every morning and evening. Foods and drinks: the Qur'an has emphasized most of all on fruits in the Heaven. According to Qur'anic verses, every type of fruit can always be found in the Heaven in abundance, and they can be easily picked from the trees. The Qur'an has twice pointed to the meat and the flesh of birds as bounties of the Heaven. The Qur'an 47 :15 points to drinks of the Heaven: streams of water, milk, wine, and honey, cups of very pleasant and white wine mixed with the aroma of camphor or ginger from a spring called \" Salsabil \", or mixed with musk. The words, \"sharab\" (drink) and \"sharab tahur\" (pure drink) in the Qur'an also refer to drinks of the Heaven. The Qur'an has emphasized that the wine of the Heaven is free of the problems of the wine of this world (such as intoxication, headache, inclination to sins, and dementia). Clothes: other blessings of the Heaven include silk and dibaj clothes, golden, silver, and pearl bracelets, silk and brocade carpets with gorgeous, tall pillows, golden trays, silver dishes, crystal cups, with young and handsome servants. Marriage: another blessing of the Heaven is the bond of marriage which is referred to in the Qur'an as \"pure spouses\", \"your spouses\", and \"We make them spouses\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have appealed to the Qur'an 13 :23 and Qur'an 40 :8 to show that spouses who are both believers in this world will live together in the Heaven as well. And if parents and children are all righteous, they will be in the Heaven together (the Qur'an 36 :56 and the Qur'an 43 :70). Moreover, the Qur'an has pointed to \"hur\" (once) and \"hur 'in\" (white women with black eyes, three times) and their marriage with people of the Heaven. According to the Qur'an, these women are beautiful and fresh, chaste, and far from any lustful look. Eye-catching things: in the Qur'an 43:71, it is said that everything eye-catching—whatever pleases the eyes—can be found in the Heaven and every desire is satisfied there. Some exegetes have appealed to these phrases to show that the blessings of the Heaven mentioned in the Qur'an do not exhaust all the blessings. The bliss of the Heaven is beyond human minds. Other features of the Heaven: in addition to positive features of the Heaven, the Qur'an has rejected any negative features about it. With respect to its positive features, the Qur'an says that the Heaven is eternal and permanent, secure, stable, continuous, and available. Negative features from which the Heaven is said to be free, include: suffering, frustration, sadness, committing sins , vain talks, attributing lies, hearing any lies, intoxication, and dementia. Degrees In the Islamic culture, it is accepted that the degrees of the Heaven are correlated with human actions, but it is not obvious what degrees are yielded by each action. According to exegetes of the Qur'an, such as al-Fakhr al-Razi , the word, \"darajāt\" (degrees), in the Qur'an with respect to the Heaven, refers to the ranking of the blessings in the Heaven: human beings will enjoy different degrees of the Heaven in accordance to their actions. The Qur'an and hadiths have emphasized different degrees of the Heaven. According to a hadith from the Prophet (s), the Heaven has degrees the distance between each of which is like the distance between the Earth and the sky. Actions and Characters of Heavenly People Many actions are said by the Qur'an and hadiths to lead people to the Heaven. Men and women are said to be equal in this respect. The most frequently mentioned features of heavenly people in the Qur'an include faith , piety , righteous action, obeying God and His messenger, accepting the truth, purity, and avoiding polytheism . The Qur'an also points to characters such as humbleness towards God and people, fear of God, good behavior, avoiding mundane desires, truthfulness, generosity , trustfulness, keeping one's promises, financial aid of the impoverished, avoiding vain talks and actions, and avoiding arrogance . Some people are said to be prohibited from entering the Heaven, such as those who deny divine signs or revelations of God. Some characters and actions that lead to the Heaven include: helping other people, being kind to people, good talk, and avoiding any injustice to others. Some wrong behaviors deprive people of going to the Heaven, such as telling lies, talebearing , ridiculing others, malevolence, contributing to the injustice of the rulers, promiscuity, and drinking wine. The Heaven of Adam (a) and Eve In three Qur'anic suras ( Qur'an 2 :35, Qur'an 7 :19-20, and Qur'an 20 :115, 117 and 120), the first residence of Adam (a) and Eve is said to be the \"Heaven\" (Jannat). According to Qur'anic verses, they enjoyed all the blessings in the Heaven and all of their desires were satisfied, but despite this abundance and welfare, they were warned not to approach a certain tree (and not to eat its fruit). They were also warned about the Devil 's temptations. Adam (a) and his wife disobeyed God, followed the Devil's temptations, and ate the fruit of the forbidden tree . They were thus deported from the Heaven and had to live on the Earth. After this fall (hubut), the life of the human species began on the Earth. There are three views, in Islamic exegetical and theological books, with respect to this Heaven. Al-Fakhr al-Razi has cited all the three views and the arguments for them. Here are the views: (i) it refers to a garden on the Earth, (ii) a heavenly garden other than the promised Heaven, and (iii) the promised Heaven. Al-Fakhr al-Razi holds that all the three views are plausible, though none of them can be proved. Thus, he remained neutral on the issue. Al-Allama al-Majlisi has also pointed to these three views and their arguments. He cited hadiths according to which the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve is the promised Heaven. In other sources, it is identified as a garden on the Earth. Al-Majlisi concluded that we cannot decide on this issue. He also speculated that it might be the heaven of Barzakh Among later exegetes of the Qur'an, Muhammad 'Abduh take the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve to be an Earthly one, taking this to be the view of Sunni scholars. However, Allama Tabataba'i takes the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve to be in the sky, but other than the promised Heaven. He takes it to be located in the world of Barzakh. He also takes the Qur'anic story of the fall from Eden to be a metaphor for the birth of every human person in this world. Books and Writings regarding the Heaven Many independent works have been written about the Heaven and the Hell . Moreover, significant parts of many collections of hadiths are devoted to the citation of hadiths concerning the Heaven and the Hell. Here are some Shiite works in this regard: Ma'alim al-zulfa written by Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani . The section of \"al-'Adl wa l-ma'ad\" (justice and resurrection) in Bihar al-anwar by Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi . Sifat al-janna wa l-nar : a collection of hadiths from Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) regarding the Heaven and the Hell written by Su'ayd b. Janah al-Azdi , a companion of Imam al-Kazim (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) . The book is wholly cited in Ikhtisas and Bihar al-anwar . In addition to Shiite works, some Sunni works are also devoted to the citation of hadiths regarding the Heaven and the Hell, including: Sifat al-janna written by Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani . Shu'ab al-iman written by Ahmad b. Husayn al-Bayhaqi . Al-Targhib wa l-tarhib written by 'Abd al-'Azim b. 'Abd al-Qawiy al-Mundhiri .

{"title": "Imamate", "text": "Imamate (Arabic: الإمامة ), from Shi'a point of view, is the leadership of the Islamic society, designated by God to succeed the Prophet (s) in all religious and worldly affairs. It is among the principles of Shi'a school and one of the points of difference between Shi'a and Sunnis . The importance of this principle among Shi'a led them to be titled as Imamiyya . According to Shi'a teachings, the Prophet (s) made a lot of efforts to introduce his caliph and the leader of Muslims after himself since the beginning of his mission. His efforts towards this aim began since his first public invitation by introducing 'Ali (a) as his caliph and successor and continued until the last days of his life on the way back from Farewell Hajj on Dhu l-Hijja 18 in event of Ghadir Khumm . Sunni Muslims also emphasize on the necessity of an Imam and to obey him, however, they believe that it is upon the Muslim umma to elect an Imam and that the Prophet (s) has not appointed any person as his successor. During history, Shi'a have found different opinions about the number and instances of Imams. According to Imamiyya Shi'a, the number of Imams (a) is twelve; the first of whom was Imam 'Ali (a) after Imam 'Ali (a), Imam al-Hasan (a) and then his brother Imam al-Husayn (a) became Imam and after these three, nine descendants of Imam al-Huasyn (a) became Imam one after another and the last Imam is Imam al-Mahdi (a) .. The reason behind Imam's existence is to safeguard and transfer religion and correctly explain religious teachings; therefore, to perform his duties properly, it is necessary for an Imam to have the power to abandon sins , God-given knowledge and Wilaya (guardianship) from God . Meaning  Literally, imamate means leadership and the word \"imam\" refers to one or thing followed by people. Accordingly, different examples for this meaning have been provided in Arabic dictionaries such as the Qur'an , the Prophet's (s) successor, imam of congregational prayer , a commander of an army, a guide of passengers, a caravan leader, a camel herder, and a scholar who is followed. In the Qur'an In the Qur'an the word \"imam\" is used both for some human beings and for referring to other issues; non-human usages of this word are: preserved tablet (al-Lawh al-mahfuz), an open highway and the Book of Moses (a) . The usage of this word for humans has been two kinds: imam of the truth and imam of the falsehood. The cases of the imam of the truth are: prophets (a), righteous servants of God and the oppressed. Leaders of disbelief such as Pharaoh and his agents are imams of the falsehood in the Qur'an. Also in some cases, the word \"imam\" is used including all the mentioned usages, \"The day We shall summon every group of people with their imam\" ( Quran 17 :71). Technical Meaning Theologians have defined imamate in two ways; Some definitions are general and include prophethood as well; for example, it has been defined as the \"general leadership in religious and worldly issues\". The second definitions are those which regard imamate as the succession of the Prophet (s) in religious affairs and consider following imam obligatory. Given the above mentioned points, it can be said that the definition of imamate as the \"leadership of the Islamic society in religious and worldly affairs as the successor of the Prophet (s)\" is accepted by all Islamic schools. In the View of Shi'a Shi'a regards imamate one of the Islamic doctrines of faith, but Mu'tazilites , 'Asharites , and other Islamic schools consider it among secondary beliefs . Accordingly, Shi'a have a more prominent position for imamate compared with Sunnis . In Shi'a culture, imamate includes more duties and responsibilities, in addition to those of a caliph. Its importance can be clearly understood from verses of the Qur'an and hadiths about imamate because according to Shi'a, imamate is in fact a matter similar to prophethood. Relation with Caliphate The special position of imamate among Muslims also becomes obvious when the matter is historically studied. After the Prophet (s) passed away, the most important and critical issue debated and discussed among Muslims was imamate. No other religious teaching has ever been argued over like imamate has. Leadership of the Islamic society after the Prophet (s) is called both caliphate and imamate and the one who take over this position is called both caliph and imam. From the point that people have to follow him, he is called imam and from the point that his leadership is in succession of the Prophet (s), he is called caliph. Therefore in Islam , imam is the caliph and successor of the Prophet (s). However, about the question whether he can be called as \"Khalifat Allah\" (vicegerent of Allah), there are two opinions among Sunni scholars; some regarded it permissible and some others considered it impermissible. Ahl al-Bayt (a) have also regarded imamate as succession of God and His Prophet (s). As a Divine Pledge The Qur'an has regarded imamate higher than prophethood , because about the Prophet Abraham (a) , it has mentioned that after he (a) achieved the position of prophethood and was successful in trials and divine tests, the position of imamate was granted to him, \"and when his Lord tested Abraham (a) with certain words, and he fulfilled them, He said, 'I am making you the Imam of mankind.' Said he, 'And from among my descendants?' He said, 'My pledge does not extend to the unjust.'\" ( Qur'an 2 :124) Moreover, in this verse, God refers to imamate as His pledge. Therefore, this position is not subject to election by people. This has also been mentioned in hadiths . As the Cause of Religion's Perfection The importance of imamate is evident in hadiths mentioned about the al-Ikmal Verse (perfection of religion). According to these hadiths, the mentioned verse has been revealed about the event of Ghadir Khumm when by the order of God, the Prophet (s) introduced 'Ali (a) as the leader of Islamic society after himself. Accordingly, Islam reached its desired perfection through imamate. The al-Tabligh Verse is also referring to the same issue; since, according to this verse and the hadiths about the cause of its revelation , imamate has such a great position that if the Prophet (s) did not announce it, it was as if he (a) had not accomplished his mission and his efforts would be lost. On the Day of Judgment According to the Qur'an , on the Day of Judgment , everyone goes to his own leader, \"The day We shall summon every group of people with their imam\" (Qur'an 17:71). This is also mentioned in a hadith both Shi'a and Sunnis have narrated from Imam al-Rida (a) , it says that on the Day of Judgment, every group is summoned by their divine book and the tradition of their prophet and leader. Imam 'Ali (a) said, \"Imams (a) are God's guides and leaders for His servants and no one will enter the paradise unless he knows them and they know him and no one will enter the hell unless he rejects them and they reject him.\" In many hadiths narrated from Imams (a), it is mentioned that prayer , zakat , fasting , hajj , and wilaya are the pillars of Islam , among which wilaya has a better position because it is the key and guide to the rest. Necessity of the Existence of Imam (a) From the viewpoint of Twelver Shi'a theologians , imamate is incumbent and its necessity is theological; i.e. it is incumbent upon God , not necessary for people. The meaning of this necessity is that it is a matter required by justice, wisdom, grace, and other attributes of God's perfection; and since, abandoning it implies a deficiency in God and thus impossible, thus doing it is necessary and incumbent upon God. However, this obligation roots in God's attributes of perfection, not an outside obligation. As God has made mercy and guidance obligatory upon Himself, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi says, \"Twelver Shi'a believe that appointment of Imam is an act of grace; because it draws people near to obedience and away from disobedience; and that grace is incumbent upon God.\" Non-Shi'a Schools Most Islamic schools consider imamate necessary, even though there is a disagreement about whether it is a jurisprudential, theological, or rational obligation. 'Asharites regard it obligatory but because they do not believe in rational goodness and evil (al-husn wa l-qubh al-'Aqliyyayn) and any obligation for God, they regard imamate obligatory for people due to hadiths , not rationally obligatory. 'Adud al-Din al-Iji believes that 'Asharites consider appointment of Imam obligatory according to hadiths meaning that existence and appointment of Imam is necessary because God has said so, not because our intellect has concluded it. [24] Mu'tazilites , Maturidites , Abadiyyas, and a group of Zaydis regarded imamate incumbent upon people. Some Mu'tazilites regarded the necessity of imam rational and some others considered it necessary due to hadiths. [25] Reasons of Necessity Uli l-Amr Verse “ O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority among you. ” — Quran 4:59 In this verse, God orders people to obey Uli l-Amr , thus, they need to exist in the first place so that people obey them. Al-Taftazani refers to this reason and says. \"the necessity of obedience from Uli l-Amr requires its actualization.\" Hadith Man Mat The Prophet (s) said, \"One who dies not knowing Imam of his time, dies the death of ignorance.\" Some Muslim theologians has interpreted this hadith as the reason for the necessity of imamate, since according to this hadith, knowing Imam at any time is a religious duty and requires constant existence of Imam. Tradition of Muslims Some theologians have regarded the tradition of Muslims as the reason for necessity of imamate since it can be understood from the tradition of Muslims that they have considered the necessity of imamate a certain and unshakable issue. The disagreement between Shi'a and Sunnis has been actually over the case of imamate, not its principle. Abu 'Ali and Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i and some others have referred to the consensus of the companions on necessity of imamate. Qa'idat al-Lutf (Principle of Grace) The most important rational reason theologians bring for necessity of Imamate is the principle of grace. Shi'a theologians consider Imamate a clear example of the principle of grace and have said that God should be kind to His servants and appointing and introducing Imam is an act of grace, thus imamate is incumbent upon God. To explain that imamate is an act of grace, al-Sharif al-Murtada said, \"We know that human beings have rational duties and we know that the duty-bound (Mukallaf) are not infallible . Therefore, the reason for necessity of imamate is that any intelligent person who is familiar with the common sense and the tradition of the wise would know that whenever there is a competent and wise leader in a society who stand against tyranny and evil and defends justice and human values, social situation will be readier for development of virtues and values and this nothing but God's grace, since grace is what causes the duty-bound turn to obedience and virtues and turn away from vices and evil. Therefore, imamate is an act of grace towards the duty-bound.\" Theologians such as Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani , Sadid al-Din al-Himsi , Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , and others have had different explanations for imamate and its necessity with regards to the mentioned principle [of grace]. Even though Mu'tazilite theologians have accepted the principle of grace, they do not accept its effect on this issue and that imamate is an act of grace and have mentioned some criticisms which al-Sharif al-Murtada have answered to in al-Shafi fi l-imama . Philosophy Since Sunnis consider imam only a political leader of the society, they mention establishment of a government, performance of ordinary responsibilities of the government and management of the society as the philosophy for the existence of imam. For example, from Mu'tazilite viewpoint, performing religious rulings, guarding the existence of the Islamic society, preparing and mobilizing soldiers to fight with the enemy and such affairs are included in responsibilities of the Imam. However, Twelver Shi'a have stated two kind of goals for the existence of Imam. The first kind are the same practical goals and benefits Sunnis have mentioned. Accordingly, preserving the Muslims' social system, establishing social justice, Islamic rulings especially those with collective aspects and performing religious punishments have been mentioned among the goals of imamate. However, another area which covers the most important goals of imamate include: delivering, preserving and explaining religion. Delivering Religion From the Twelver Shi'a viewpoint, God has revealed religion to the Prophet (s) in complete form and the Prophet (s) has delivered it to Imams (a) in complete form so that they gradually explain all the rulings to people. Accordingly, details of the rulings related to worship, contracts, unilateral deals, heritage, punishments, blood-money are not mentioned in the Qur'an and the conduct of the Prophet (s). What is mentioned is the general aspects of these rulings. The rulings we have received through hadiths of the Prophet (s) are limited and not all of them are authentic regarding their references. Therefore, to compensate for this deficiency, Sunnis have had to use means such as qiyas (deduction by analogy), istihsan (judicial preference) and other sources which do not bring about certitude. Qiyas, istihsan and other non-certain methods are regarded invalid by Shi'a, since we do not have any authentic rational or legitimate proof according to which such methods can be used in the process of judgment. For example, fasting the last day of the month of Ramadan is obligatory , the first day of Shawwal forbidden and the second day of Shawwal is recommended while these days are the same apparently. Therefore, just based on their similarity, one cannot extend the ruling for one to another. From Shi'a viewpoint, the Prophet (s) has delivered Islam fully and there has not been any deficiency in it to be compensated by qiyas or istihsan. However, due to people's lack of maturity and lack of many issues at that time, many rulings would not be applied to common people at that time. The Prophet (s) taught these rulings to Imams after himself so that they later explain them to people. Guarding Religion Another criterion which necessitates the existence of imam and is mentioned among philosophies of the existence of imam is guarding religion. Accordingly, existence of imam helps religion to be saved from alterations, because the Qur'an has neither explained the details of rulings, nor does it speak by itself and needs interpretation. However since people's understanding of the Qur'an would be wrong, there is a need for those whose understanding of the Qur'an would be free from error or alteration. Their existence is a standard for recognizing others' misunderstandings and it would be what guards religion. Moreover, rulings and teachings which have been narrated as agreed by consensus or by many people are few and do not cover all the rulings of religion. Also, consensus alone, without referring to the ideas of the Infallible (a) is invalid. Therefore, the only way left is that religion would be guarded by an infallible imams (a) , because then his opinion is all right due to his infallibility and through which other opinions interpreting the Qur'an and explaining religion can be evaluated. Explaining Religious Teachings Among other factors which necessitate the existence of Imam is explanation of those religious rulings and teachings which have not been explained by the Prophet (s) due to lack of time and appropriate situation and they have been left to imam for explanation. Attributes and Requirements Infallibility One of the conditions and requirements of imamate is his immaculacy from sins and error in carrying out his duties and mission. The reason for it is that imam is the successor of the Prophet (s) and the reference in religious rulings and teachings, the Qur'an and the conduct of the Prophet (s). Therefore, he needs to be immaculate from sins and errors so that people can trust on him and his words. Otherwise, people's trust would be lost and God's goal from appointment of imams would be found meaningless. God-given Knowledge Infallible imams (s) had some other knowledge beside those they had heard directly or indirectly from the Prophet (s). That knowledge is among extraordinary knowledge which they have been given through inspiration and intuition such as those given to Khidr (a) , Dhu l-Qarnayn , lady Mary (a) and mother of Moses (a) . It was having such a knowledge that made some Imams (a) reach imamate in young ages. Thanks to this knowledge, they were aware about anything they needed for the guidance of people and carrying out their duties and did not need to learn them from others. Wilaya Wilaya is a closeness to God which brings about a certain power of influence for the closed one. This Wilaya has two types: in creation and in religion. Wilaya in creation or Wilaya over creation is Imam's guardianship over creatures of the world and influencing on them. The other type is Wilaya in religion which includes Imam's guardianship in interpretation and explanation of the Qur'an , the conduct of the Prophet (s) and leadership of the society. Authoritaty and Necessity of Obedience It means that Imam's words and his interpretation of God's word is authoritative and necessary to be obeyed. This attribute is the result of benefiting from God-given knowledge and knowing God's intention in verses of Divine Books. Imams (a) of Shi'a Imams of Shi'a are twelve people from the progeny of the Prophet (s) who are intellectual, spiritual and political leaders of Shi'a. The first one of whom was Imam 'Ali (a) and the rest are Imam 'Ali (a) and Lady Fatima's (a) children and grandchildren. According to Shi'a beliefs, after the Prophet (s), leadership of the Islamic society would always be upon Imams (a) who have been appointed by God. These Imams (a) have God-given knowledge, infallibility and the rights of intercession and by making Tawassul to them, one can become close to God. In addition to authority in religious teachings, these twelve Imams (a) have political leadership of the society as well. There are many hadiths from the Prophet (s) which have described their attributes and mentioned their names and show that all of them are from Quraysh and among the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) and the Promised Mahdi (a) is the last one of them. There are clear hadiths from the Prophet (s) about imamate of Imam 'Ali (a), the first Imam. Also, there are definite hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) about the imamate of the second Imam and respectively Imams (a) have clearly mentioned the Imams after them. According to these hadiths, Imams (a) are 12 and their names are: 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) Hasan b. 'Ali (a) Husayn b. 'Ali (a) 'Ali b. Husayn (a) Muhammad b. 'Ali (a) Ja'far b. Muhammad (a) Musa b. Ja'far (a) 'Ali b. Musa (a) Muhammad b. 'Ali (a) 'Ali b. Muhammad (a) Hasan b. 'Ali (a) Mahdi (a) Incompatibility with Khatamiyya As it was mentioned, imamate is among challenging doctrines which has been the center for many arguments since early Islam. One of the questions mentioned about it is that imamate as explained above and Shi'a believe in is incompatible with Khatamiyyat (the End of Prophethood); since, the person qualified for imamate as Shi'a believe in has no difference with the Prophet (s). Ayatollah Ja'far Subhani answered this question as below: \"The difference between prophethood and explanation of the knowledge of the Holy Prophet (s) is obvious and does not need much explanation; as prophethood means that the Prophet (s) receives revelation , hears God's word, sees His messenger and either delivers an independent religion or preaches the religion before himself. But Imam is the keeper of the knowledge of the Prophet (s) in whatever people need without being addressed by revelation, without hearing God's word or seeing the angel carrying the message.\" Moreover, some others believe that imamate as defined above is only a result of Shi'a's exaggeration and has not been existed in early authentic Islamic texts and beliefs of the Shi'a in the first centuries.

{"title": "Mawadda of Ahl al-Bayt (a)", "text": "Mawadda (Arabic: مَوَدَّة ) is an Arabic word which means \"love\", adopted from Mawadda verse . This verse and some other narrations such as hadith Bab Hitta and also the conduct of the Prophet (s) indicate that loving the Ahl al-Bayt (a) is incumbent upon Muslims. In the Mawadda Verse “ قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it except love of [my] relatives.' ” — Q,42:23 In the verse of Mawadda, the love of the progeny of the Prophet (s) has been considered as the reward for his mission. \"Relatives\" in the verse refers to those about whom the Tathir verse was revealed. According to al-Hakim al-Nishaburi , after the martyrdom of 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , al-Hasan b. 'Ali (a) gave a speech for people and introduced himself and said: \"I am one of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) to whom Gabriel descended; and I am from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) God repelled from them any evil. And I am from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) God made their love incumbent upon every Muslim and said, \"Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it except love of [my] relatives.' Whoever performs a good deed, We shall enhance for him its goodness.\" (42:23) To do goodness is the love of us the Ahl a-Bayt (a).\" As al-Khwarazmi narrated from Ibn 'Abbas , when the al-Mawadda verse was revealed, some people told the Prophet (s), \"who are these relatives of yours, whose love has been incumbent upon us? The Prophet (s) answered, \"'Ali (a), Fatima (a) , and their two sons.\" In Hadiths Al-Tabari narrated from Abu Daylam that when 'Ali b. al-Husayn (a) was brought into Damascus as captive , a man from Syria stood up and, filled with jubilation, spoke boldly about the murdering of Imam al-Husayn (a) , his companions, and the capturing of his family and children. Imam al-Sajjad (a) told him, \"Have you ever recited the al-Mawadda verse?\" the man said, \"Does 'Qurba' (relatives) refer to you? Imam (a) answered, \"yes\". Ibn 'Asakir narrated from Imam al-Husayn (a) saying, \"the relationship God has counted great and has made observing it incumbent upon people and regarded as reward for the Prophet's (s) mission, is our relationship.\" The Shafi'i hadith scholar, al-Hafiz Abu 'Abd Allah al-Ganji narrated from al-Tabarani that the Prophet (s) said, \"God created prophets (s) from different trees (different origins) and created me and 'Ali (a) from one tree (origin). I am the root of that tree and 'Ali (a) is a branch of it, Fatima (a) is its conception and al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) are its fruits. Anyone who hangs on to one of them will survive and anyone who turns away from them will fall. And if a person worships three thousand years between Safa and Marwa , while not having our love, God will throw him in the hell.\" He (s) then recited the Mawadda verse. About the reference of the hadith , Abu Abd Allah Ganji said, \"this hadith is highly good.\" Abu Nu'yim al-Isfahani narrated from Zadhan that 'Ali (a) said, \"About us, the people of HaMim (two Suras of Qur'an begin with HaMim), it is set that our love will not be observed except by the faithful and then he (a) recited al-Mawadda verse.\" After narrating narrations about incumbency of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , Ibn Hajar al-Makki said, \"From aforementioned hadiths, the incumbency of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and absolute prohibition of having hatred towards them were understood. Al-Bayhaqi, al-Baghawi and others have asserted on the incumbency of the love of them. Al-Shafi'i has also expressed that in some poems narrated from him.\" After narrating the hadith Bab Hitta , he has said, \"the resemblance of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) to Bab Hitta (Hitta door) is that God made entering with humbleness while repenting through it, which was in Ariha, to Jerusalem, forgiving for Israelites and the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) a cause of forgiveness for the Islamic Umma .\" Conduct of the Prophet (s) Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , the great Shafi'i commentator and theologian of the 6th/12th century has justified the incumbency of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) in the following way, \"there is no doubt that the Prophet (s) , loved 'Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) ; thus, this is incumbent upon all the Umma, since God has said, 'and follow him so that you may be guided.' (Quran 7:158) and he (s) also said, 'If you love God, follow me so that God loves you.' (Quran 3:31) And elsewhere the Qur'an also states, 'In the Apostle of Allah there is certainly for you a good exemplar,' (Quran 33:21).\" Al-Razi interpreted Al Muhammad (family of Muhamamd) as 'Ali (a), Fatima (a), al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) and said, \"family of Muhamamd are those who are relatives of the Prophet (s); therefore, anyone who has a stronger and more complete relationship with the Prophet (s) would be considered his family. And there is no doubt that Fatima (a), 'Ali (a), Hasan (a) and Husayn (a) had strongest attachment with the Prophet (s). Therefore, they (a) are family of the Prophet (s).\" He then brings a reference from a hadith narrated by Zamakhshari that when the Mawadda verse descended, people asked the Prophet (s), \"who are those relatives of yours, whose love is incumbent upon us?\" The Prophet (s) said, \"Ali (a), Fatima (a) and their two sons (a).\" Why the Prophet (s) Asked for a Reward Question: In different verses of the Qur'an , it is stressed that divine prophets (a) did not ask for a reward, and this is one of the characteristics of prophets (a). They emphasized that their reward is upon God and no one else (\"Surely, my reward is upon no one but God\", [11:29, 26:127, ...]). Thus, how can the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) be considered as the reward of Prophet's (s) mission? Answer: From related verses, it can be understood that the Prophet (s) did not ask any material or non-material reward from Muslims for himself, \"Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it, and I am no impostor.\" (38:86) and that he (s) asked the love of his Ahl al-Bayt (a) as the reward for his mission, it would be for their own benefit. \"Say, 'Whatever reward I may have asked you is for your own good. My [true] reward lies only with Allah.'\" (Quran 34:47) The reward the Prophet (s) asked people and is in fact for their own benefit is that they would accept his religion and act upon it, since his religion is the path to God and choosing the path to God is the cause of human's happiness. \"Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it, except that anyone who wishes should take the way to his Lord.'\" (Quran 25:57) However, going on the way toward God requires knowing it which needs guides who know the way well and steadfast in passing through it. These guides are the infallible Ahl al-Bayt (s) of the Prophet (s). It is obvious that if anyone wants to fully benefit from their guidance, he would need to love them in advance, admires and dignifies them so that their personalities would be attractive to him. This is mentioned in the Mawadda verse. Notes References Events Books Related"}
{"title": "Mi'raj", "text": "Al-Miʿrāj (Arabic: المِعراج , lit. ascent) or al-Isrāʾ (Arabic: الإسراء ) is the nightly journey of the Holy Prophet (s) from Mecca to al-Aqsa Mosque and from there to the skies. Both Shi'a and Sunni are unanimous regarding the happening of Mi'raj according to frequent verses and hadiths . Still, they disagree regarding the time, place, numbers, condition, and physical or spiritual nature. This event happened in the final years of the noble Prophet's (s) stay in Mecca. In Mi'raj, the Prophet (s) saw divine signs and met some great prophets' souls. Meaning Literally, Mi'raj means ladder, stairs and anything by which one can ascend while in usage it refers to the nightly journey of the Prophet (s) from Mecca to al-Aqsa Mosque and from there to the skies and reaching Sidrat al-Muntaha and the position of Divine Qab Qawsayn . In the Qur'an and Hadiths According to al-Tabrisi , Mi'raj of the Prophet (s) is among the issues that Shi'a, Sunni, verses along with frequent hadiths support. The story of Mi'raj has been mentioned in Qur'an 17 and Qur'an 53 . Date There are discrepancies among narrations regarding the exact year and whether it was before the demise of Abu Talib or after it. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i the famous report is that the nightly journey of the Prophet (s) happened in the final years of his stay in Mecca (before the Hijra ). Ja'far Subhani maintain that the journey was after 10th of Bi'tha and it cannot be before that. Mulla Fath Allah Kashani and Ahmad b. 'Ali al-Tabrisi also believe that the most famous viewpoint is that Mi'raj happened in 12th after Bi'tha (=2 BH). Nightly Journey From the two words of \"layl\" (Arabic: لیلاً , by night) and \"asra\" (Arabic: أسری , carried on a journey) in the first verse of Qur'an 17 (Sura al-Isra'), it can be understood that this journey happened at night. But in the narrations, it is referred to with many differences as in which night it took place. In most cases, it has been narrated to have happened in one of the following nights: Timeline of in Mecca 'Abd Allah Amina bt. Wahb 'Abd al-Muttalib Damascus Khadija bt. Khuwaylid Bi'tha Prophethood Yawm al-Dar Lady Fatima (a) Abyssinia Banu Hashim Shi'b Abi Talib Abu Talib Khadija bt. Khuwaylid Mi'raj The First Pledge of al-'Aqaba The Second Pledge of al-'Aqaba Medina Eve of Rabi' I 17 [10] Eve of Rajab 27 , according to Mulla Fath Allah Kashani, author of Manhaj al-sadiqin is the most famous report. [11] Eve of Ramadan 17 [12] Eve of Ramadan 21 Some have also mentioned a night in Shawwal or Rabi' II . [13] The time it took for the Prophet (s) to go to Jerusalem and al-Aqsa Mosque and to the skies and his return, did not last longer than one night and the next morning the Prophet (s) was in Mecca . It is been cited in Tafsir al-'Ayashi that Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"The Prophet (s) performed the prayers of 'Isha and Fajr in Mecca.\" This means that Isra' and Mi'raj happened between the two. Location There are differences among narrations about the detail of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj and whether its beginning and the end of it was the house of Umm Hani, al-Masjid al-Haram or Shi'b Abi Talib . But it is famously said that in that night, the Prophet (s) was in the house of Umm Hani, daughter of Abi Talib and from there went to Mi'raj and returned there at the end. To explain why the Qur'an has mentioned al-Masjid al-Haram as the departure of this journey, it is said that Arabs call all Mecca the sanctuary of God; therefore, all of it was assumed as mosque and sanctuary of God and the house of Umm Hani was in the sanctuary. Also, some narrations' content does not agree with the occurrence of Mi'raj in Shi'b Abi Talib. Many Occasions According to some narrations, the Prophet (s) went to Mi'raj more than just once. 'Allama Tabataba'i regarded one of them from al-Masjid al-Haram and another from the house of Umm Hani and said that the first verses of the Qur'an 53 approves this. Also, different opinions regarding the place, time and other details of Mi'raj can be justified through this theory. Description of the Journey In that night, archangel Gabriel came to the Prophet (s) and brought him a conveyance called Buraq and the Prophet (s) got on and moved toward Jerusalem . At the time of mounting on Buraq, it began to show disobedience and Gabriel hit it and told it, \"Be calm o Buraq! Previously no prophet has ever mounted on you and in the future, no one like him would ever ride you.\" After that hit, Buraq was calm and took him up which was not so high while Gabriel was with him. Entering al-Aqsa Mosque In the middle of the way, the Prophet (s) stopped in Medina , mosque of Kufa , Tur Sina and Bethlehem which is the birthplace of Prophet Jesus (a) and prayed there. He (s) then entered al-Aqsa Mosque and prayed there too. Apparently, the Prophet (s) ascended to the skies from the mosque of Qubbat al-Sakhra . The reason for naming it is the rock inside it from where the Prophet (s) ascended to the skies. In the travel log of Nasir Khusraw , it has been claimed that upon the entrance of the Prophet (s) to the mosque, that rock ascended before him and after his ascent, that rock never came back to earth. Sky of the World Speaking with the Prophet Adam (a) From there, the Prophet (s) ascended to the sky of this world and saw Prophet Adam (a) there. Then, angels came to welcome him in groups and greeted him smiling and congratulated him. The Prophet (s) saw an angel there having a frowning and angry look and greeting him (s), not smiling like others. When the Prophet (s) asked the name of that angel from Gabriel, he answered that \"this is Malik, guard of the hell and has never smiled and his wrath on the enemies of God and sinners is being increased incessantly.\" The Prophet (s) then asked Gabriel to show him the hell, and when he opened its cap, a flame rose out of it which filled the air. Conversing with Malik al-Mawt There, the Prophet (s) also met 'Izra'il (Azrael or Malak al-Mawt, the Archangel of Death) who was holding a tablet of light in his hand and after he had a conversation with the Prophet (s), said, \"all the world in my hand is like a coin in the hand of a man and he flips it. There is no house except I meet five times a day…\" That was when the Prophet (s) said, \"Indeed, death is the greatest of calamity and the harshest of event.\" And then Gabriel said, \"the events following death are worse than that.\" Second to Seventh Skies The Prophet (s) then ascended to the second sky. There, he (s) met Prophet Yahya (a) (John the Baptist) and Prophet Jesus (a), then with Prophet Joseph (a) in the third sky, with Prophet Idris (a) (Enoch) in the fourth sky, with Prophet Aaron (a) in the fifth sky and with Prophet Moses (a) in the sixth sky. Seventh Sky The Prophet (s) then went to the seventh sky and reached where Gabriel was unable to reach saying, \"I do not have permission to go there, and if I approach it as much as a tip of a finger, my wings and feather will burn.\" Return On return, the Prophet (s) landed in Jerusalem and went toward Mecca. On his way to Mecca, he (s) encountered a trade caravan of Quraysh who had lost a camel and were searching for it. The Prophet (s) drank from the water they had in a bowl and poured the rest of it on the ground and according to a report, covered the bowl's cap. He (s) landed in the house of Umm Hani before sunrise, and told her his secret for the first time and then in the daytime, disclosed his secret to the gatherings of Quraysh. Hadith of Mi'raj On the night of Mi'raj, a conversation was made between the Prophet (s) and God in the form of a divine hadith which became famous as the hadith of Mi'raj. Reaction of Quraysh The story of Mi'raj seemed to be impossible for Quraysh and made their chiefs angry the most. They denied the Prophet (s) and said, \"There are people in Mecca who have seen Jerusalem ; to prove it, describe the building!\" The Prophet (s) not only described the buildings of Jerusalem but also reported the events on the way between Mecca and Jerusalem and said that in the middle of the way, I encountered a caravan from a tribe who had lost a camel and had a bowl full of water in their goods from which I drank and then covered it. Also, I encountered a group camel of whom had escaped and had broken a leg.\" Quraysh said, \"Report on the caravan of Quraysh.\" The Prophet (s) said, \"I saw them in Tan'im as a grey camel was walking ahead of them, carrying a palanquin on its back. They must enter Mecca now. Quraysh became very angry at such definite news and said, \"We will see the truth or lies of his word now.\" Soon, a caravan entered the city and Abu Sufyan and the passengers approved the details of the Prophet's (s) report. Condition of Mi'raj Most exegetes believe that the Prophet (s) went to Jerusalem and from there to skies with his body and soul. But, Khawarij denied it and also Jahmiyya and Shaykhiyya believed it happened spiritually only. According to some narrations, when the Prophet (s) arrived in Bayt al-Ma'mur and near Sidrat al-Muntaha , some of his companions accompanied him. Prophet's (s) Reports from Mi'raj On the night of Mi'raj, he (s) saw some great signs of God. There are some reports on what the Prophet (s) saw in the skies, dwellers of paradise , the hell and angels. According to narrations reported by al-Shaykh al-Saduq and others, one of the places the Prophet (s) saw traveling above the earth was the land of Qom which glittered as a spot and when asked Gabriel about that spot, he answered, \"It is the land of Qom, where believing servants and the followers of your household will gather and wait for deliverance and will endure hardships and grief.\" The Prophet (s) also met the souls of some great prophets including Adam (a) , Abraham (a) , Moses (a) and Jesus (a) and led their prayer. Fruits of Mi'raj Obligation of daily prayer [35] Last verses of Sura al-Baqara (Qur'an 2) Revelation regarding the caliphate of Imam 'Ali (a) [36] Forgiving of sins except polytheism Advising about Hijama [37] Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Prophet (s) said, \"On the night when Gabriel took me to Mi'raj when we came back, I told him, 'O Gabriel, do you have any request from me?' he said, 'I request that you send regards to Khadija (a) on behalf of the Almighty God and behalf of me.\" When the Prophet (s) met Khadija (a), gave her regards from God and Gabriel and she replied, \"Surly, Allah , He is the Peace, and from Him is peace and towards Him is peace and with Gabriel be peace.\" [38] Position of Mi'raj in Literature and Art Since the time of Al Jalayir, Mi'raj of the Prophet (s) has been among the most dominating themes for Iranian painting. There are pictures available from this period about the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj the oldest, made by Ahmad Musa, one of the famous painters of this period. Pictures of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj reached their pinnacle of illustration in the next period of painting in Iran which was the school of Harat. Many books have been found from this period especially at the time of Shahrokh which have pictured the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj. One of these books is Mir Haydar's Mi'raj Nama in Uyghur language, which depicted different moments of Prophet's (s) Mi'raj. In a picture, Shah Muzaffar Siyah Qalam has depicted the Prophet (s) at the time of Mi'raj riding the human-faced Buraq which is accompanied by Gabriel . Nizami's Khamsas are among the most important books which have depicted pictures from the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj at the time of Timurids and periods contemporary with them. Mi'raj Painted by Sultan Muhammad One of the most famous works of painting at the time of Safavids is a Khamsa of Nizami belonging to the time of Shah Tahmasb which is a drawing of the famous scene of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj painted by Sultan Muhammad. Together with three other works attributed to him, this work is placed in the illuminated manuscript of Nizami's Khamsa ordered by Shah Tahmasb Safavi and its painting and calligraphy have been made between 942/1535-6 and 947/1540-1. Its calligrapher has been Shah Mahmud Nayshaburi, the famous calligrapher of the tenth/sixteenth century. In this work, the picture of the Prophet (s) whose face has been covered with a white mask is depicted riding Buraq among the great crowd of angelic creatures with 15 angels and Gabriel is guiding him flying ahead of Buraq. Farshchian's Mi'raj This work is painted in the size of 101 * 81.5 cm. Besides the picture of the Prophet (s), angels are in the state of supplication. In this painting which depicts the night of Mi'raj, a force can be seen which draws the hand of the Prophet (s) towards God and the higher we look, the more angels fade in the Divine Essence of God .

{"title": "Record of Actions", "text": "Record of Actions is a notebook in which one's good and bad actions are recorded and is given to one in the afterlife . According to hadiths , there are two angels on one's right and left shoulders. One of them records good actions and the other records bad actions. According to verses of the Qur'an , righteous people are given the record of their actions in their right hands and are then sent to the Heaven . Wrongdoers are given the record of their actions in their left hands or from behind, and are then sent to the Hell . The Qur'an has referred to the record of actions as \"kitab\" (book), \"zabur\" (transcripts), \"ta'ir\" (fate), and \"imam mubin\" (clear register). The exegetes have appealed to Qur'anic verses to distinguish three sorts of records of actions: one for individuals, one for nations, and one for all human beings. There are a number of views about the material of the \"record of actions\": being like physical books, of the type of human soul , the reality of actions, or the effects of human actions that are manifested on the day of resurrection . The Notion The Qur'an has referred to the \"record of actions\" as \"kitab\" (book), \"ta'ir\" (fate), \"zubur\" (transcripts), and \"imam mubin\" (clear register). According to Qur'anic verses, all good and bad, small and great actions done by human persons in this world are registered in the \"record of actions\" which is given to them on the day of resurrection. According to some hadiths , all human speeches and actions, even their blow in ash, are registered in the record. There are different views as to the material of the record of actions: Some people believe that it is like books of this world on which the actions are recorded and are then given to one on the day of resurrection. The record of actions is the human soul in which one's actions have penetrated and will never disappear. It consists in the effects of our actions which are around us and will be recovered on the day of resurrection. It is the reality of actions that is hidden from us in this world, but will be manifest to us in the afterlife . [7] How the Record of Actions is Received According to Qur'anic verses, righteous people receive the record of their actions with their right hands. They happily return to their kin and say: \"come and read the record of our actions!\" They will then go to the Heaven . Other people will receive the record of their actions with their left hands, and according to other verses, from behind, and will then be thrown into the Hell . According to verses of Qur'an 69 , they will wish that they did not exist when they receive the record of their actions and say, \"we wish that we never saw the record of our actions\". According to Qur'an 17 , on the day of resurrection, people are told to read the record of their actions. The testimony of the record for one's actions is so precise that they cannot deny what they have done in the mundane world. Sorts of the Record of Actions Quranic exegetes appeal to verses of the Qur'an to show that every person has three types of records: Record of actions specific to the individual in which all good and bad, small and great actions are registered. [15] Record of actions for nations in which the collections of their actions are registered. [16] Record of actions for all human persons. [17] Some exegetes take this to be the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). [18] Scribers of Actions The Qur'an refers to scribers of the records of actions as \"mutalaqqiyan\" (the two receivers), \"raqib\" (observer), \"'atid\" (prepared to record), and \"kiram katibin\" (noble and recording). According to hadiths , two angels accompany the person all the time. One of them is on his right shoulder, recording his right actions. The other angel is on the left shoulder, recording his or her bad actions. According to some other hadiths, there are 4 such angels, two of them register actions of the day and the other two register the actions of the night. Some hadiths imply that angels record good actions immediately, but they record bad actions after a few hours in the hope that the sinner repents or does something good that wipes out the effects of the bad action. According to hadiths, the record of actions is written in order for one not to be able to deny what he has done, and in order for them to feel ashamed in the presence of angels and refrain from doing sinful actions.

{"title": "Resort to the Dead", "text": "Resort to the Dead or Tawassul to the dead (Arabic: التوسل بالأموات ), is to seek intermediary through prominent religious leaders after their death so that they ask God to respond to one's requests. Muslims , and in particular Shi'as , believe in the resort to the dead, which is based on the presumption that the dead are able to hear the living people ( Sama' al-Mawta ) and have a life in barzakh . Shiite and Sunni sources refer to cases in which Ahl al-Bayt (a) and some of the companions resorted to the Prophet (s) after his death. Wahhabis and Ibn Taymiyya reject the legitimacy of the resort to the dead. The Notion Tawassul to the dead is the resort to the prominent religious leaders, such as the Infallibles (a) , after their death so that they ask God to respond to one's requests. Posthumous Hearing and Life in Barzakh The resort to the dead is acceptable only if there is life in barzakh and the dead are able to hear the living people, that is, only if it is possible for living persons to communicate with souls in the world of barzakh and it is possible for the souls in barzakh to hear them. Legitimacy For the legitimacy of the resort to the dead, it has been appealed to Qur'anic verses , the practice of Ahl al-Bayt (a), and the practice of Muslims: Qur'anic Evidence For the legitimacy of the resort to the dead, it has been appealed to the unqualified tone of the Qur'an 4 :64 in which believers are encouraged to ask the Prophet (s) to pray for their forgiveness by God. The verse generalizes both to the period of the Prophet's (s) life and the period after his death. Moreover, the Qur'an 5 :35 permits the resort in an unqualified way, which implies that one can make a resort to the souls of believers and prophets (a) after their death as well. The Practice of Imams of the Shi'a According to some sources, Imams of the Shi'a resorted to the Prophet (s) after his death. Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) have resorted to the Prophet (s). In his al-Tawassul Supplication , Imam al-Sajjad (a) resorted to both dead and living Infallibles. Moreover, supplications transmitted from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , such as the Supplication of Sari' al-Ijaba , show that the resort to the religious leaders is recommended even after their death. The Practice of the Companions There are reports in Sunni sources of hadiths to the effect that some of the companions and Muslims resorted to the Prophet (s) after his death. For example: A'isha 's resort to the Prophet (s) so that the drought comes to an end. The resort of a man during the caliphate of Uthman as instructed by Uthman b. Hunayf . [2] Bilal b. al-Harith 's resort to the Prophet (s) to pray for precipitation. According to one report, Malik b. Anas had a conversation with Mansur al-Dawaniqi in which he taught him how to visit the Prophet's (s) mausoleum and resort to him. The Sunni View The majority of Sunni scholars permitted the resort to the dead and did themselves resort to religious leaders. Al-Samhudi, a Shafi'i scholar in the tenth/ sixteenth century , wrote a book, Wafa' al-wafa' bi akhbar dar al-Mustafa , in which he collected cases where people resorted to the Prophet (s) and their requests were met. According to Abu Ali Khilal, whenever he had a problem, he visited the grave of Imam al-Kazim (a) and resorted to him and his problem was solved. Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i was quoted as saying that the Household of the Prophet (s) are means for the proximity to God . The Wahhabi View Wahhabis dismiss the resort to the dead as illegitimate and impermissible. Ibn Taymiyya (whose views are frequently cited by Wahhabis) believes that the resort to the prayers of the Prophet (s) and righteous people is legitimate only when they are alive, and it is an instance of polytheism to resort to them after their death. Reply According to proponents of the resort to the dead, there is no difference in resorting to divine people during their life and after their death. Just as one can legitimately ask the Prophet (s) and other divine people to pray for one and ask God for one's forgiveness during their lives, one can do so after their death as well. The Qur'an 4 :64 has also been appealed to, which includes both the period of the Prophet's (s) life and the period after his death. Moreover, the practice of Muslims, including the companions, shows that the resort to the dead was permissible.

{"title": "Ill-fated Days", "text": "Ill-fated Days (Arabic: الأَيَّام النَّحِسَات , al-ayyām al-niḥāsāt) are unfortunate and infelicitous days when nothing happens but evil. In the glorious Qur'an , this word has been used for the people of 'Ad twice . Also, in hadiths , some days are described as infelicity. Exegetes have different views about how to describe \"infelicity of days\"; however, happening different unfortunate events in those days, making the spirit of invoking God and the punishment for one's own deeds are believed to be among the reasons of this phenomenon. Meaning \"Nahs\" has been interpreted as \"unfortunate\", \"ill-fated\", \"evil\" and \"unlucky\". It has originally been interpreted as the horizon when turning into redness, like the flame of a smokeless fire or red-hot copper. They call \"ill-fated (nahs) days\", those days when nothing happens except evil and one's activities are unblessed. The word \"Nahs\" has been mentioned in the glorious Qur'an about the people of 'Ad twice. In Qur'an 54 :19, it is mentioned, “ Indeed We unleashed upon them an icy gale on an incessantly ill-fated day. ” and Qur'an 41 :16 mentions, “ So We unleashed upon them an icy gale during ill-fated days, in order that We might make them taste a humiliating punishment in the life of the world. Yet the punishment of the Hereafter will be surely more disgraceful, and they will not be helped. ” which refers to the disgraceful punishment for the people of 'Ad on ill-fated days while it considers the punishment of the Hereafter more disgraceful for them. In Shi'a hadith sources too, there are many hadiths about ill-fated nature of the days of the week such as Monday and Wednesday as well as certain Arabic , Persian and Roman months. However, most of these hadiths have been considered weak and unreliable due to lack of chain of transmission, being mursal or mixed with forged and superstitious hadiths and only few of them have been considered having reliable chains of transmission. Unfortunateness of Days Exegetes have different opinions about describing time as ill-fated. Allama Tabataba'i believed that there is no reason for considering some days or times ill-fated; because, units of time are equal in extent and there is no difference between one day and another, so that one of them would be considered ill-fated and another fortunate. On the contrary, Tafsir-i nimuna does not consider describing days as ill-fated or fortunate intellectually impossible; but, it believes that there is no intellectual way of reasoning to prove or reject that. Finally, it says that if there are religious reasons for it, they have to be accepted. Reason for Describing Days as Ill-fated In hadiths, some reasons have been mentioned for describing days of the week or months as ill-fated: Happening frequent unfortunate events at that time; such as the demise of the Prophet (s) , martyrdom of Imam al-Husayn (a) , casting the Prophet Abraham (a) onto the fire and the infliction of divine punishment upon different people which have been mentioned as the reason for describing some days ill-fated. By considering a certain day ill-fated, these hadiths mean to attract people's attention toward the events happened in that day, so that they avoid doing anything which incurs punishment. [10] In such days, respecting those who have received a suffering has been emphasized and it is advised to abandon common activities and ignoring pleasures. [11] Creating the spirit of entreaty and awareness towards God and asking Him for help, to remain safe on the days called \"ill-fated (nahs). [12] In some hadiths, almsgiving , reciting supplications and the Qur'an , trusting in God and asking His mercy are emphasized on these days. [13] After mentioning a hadith from Imam al-Hadi (a) [14] , 'Allama Tabataba'i mentioned that the only factor for the days to be unfortunate is people's taking things for a bad omen because this has a real influence on people's lives and these hadiths try to free people from the evil of superstitions. [15] According to the views of others too, happening unfortunate events to people on some days is a return of their wrong deeds and days have no direct influence on or relation with those events. [16] Unfortunateness of the Month of Safar Some common people refer to a hadith from the noble Prophet (s) and consider the month of Safar ill-fated and congratulate its end to each other and celebrate the beginning of the month of Rabi' al-Awwal ; while, in hadith references, that hadith has been mentioned to praise the personality of Abu Dhar al-Ghifari and has no relation with unfortunateness of the month of Safar.

{"title": "Revelation", "text": "Revelation or waḥy (Arabic: الوحي ) is a spiritual unknown connection between a prophet and the Unseen World , in which a divine message is conveyed to that prophet. Sometimes there is a medium in this connection and sometimes, without any medium, the message is conveyed. In theology , this process is called \"legislative or prophetic revelation\" and it is specific to the Prophets (a) and is different to inspiration and conversation. This subject has attracted thinkers of our contemporary time and new interpretations have been proposed for it which are mostly based on \" religious experience \". Meaning Literally, \"wahy\" means \"a quick notice\" and \"hidden implication of something.\" In religious terminology, it refers to the spiritual connection between a prophet and the Unseen World, in which a divine message is conveyed to that prophet. The result of this process is a definite awareness bestowed from God upon the prophet. Qur'anic Applications This word has been used in different cases in the Qur'an which include its specific meaning as well: \"A hidden notice\" as in the story of Prophet Zechariah (a) , \"So he emerged before his people from the Temple, and signaled to them that they should glorify [Allah] morning and evening.\" [4] Guidance through instinct such as the natural guidance of honey bee: \"And your Lord inspired the bee [saying]: 'Make your home in the mountains and on the trees and the trellises that they erect.\" [5] Natural guidance like the revelation upon the matters: \"And revealed in each heaven its ordinance.\" [6] Inspirations from God to ones who are not prophets: \"We revealed to Moses' mother, [saying], 'Nurse him; then, when you fear for him, cast him into the river\" [7] Prophetic revelations upon the Prophets (a): \"Certainly it has been revealed to you and to those [who have been] before you: 'If you ascribe a partner to Allah your works shall fail and you shall surely be among the losers.\" [8] Characteristics Prophetic revelation has some characteristics: During this process, teachings are delivered to Prophets (a) through a non-human medium: \"It is just a revelation that is revealed [to him], (4) taught him by One of great powers,\" [10] In most cases, the process of delivering the divine message has been done by the Angel of Revelation, Jabra'il : \"Brought down by the Trustworthy Spirit\" [11] The Prophet (a) himself is fully aware that this process is not a self imagination and that its source is from outside him. Ways Deliverance of the divine message through revelation occurs in different ways. These ways have been mentioned in verse 51 of the Qur'an 42 : \"It is not [possible] for any human that Allah should speak to him except through revelation or from behind a curtain, or send a messenger who reveals by His permission whatever He wishes. Indeed He is all-exalted, all-wise.\" Conversation of God with His prophet without any medium (conversational revelation) Direct deliverance of divine word upon the heart of the prophet, without interfering any medium in between (inspirational revelation) In the form of a true dream in sleep; [13] such as the true dream of Prophet Abraham (a) regarding the sacrifice of his son, Isma'il (a) : \"When he was old enough to assist in his endeavor, he said, 'My son! I see in a dream that I am sacrificing you.\" [14] Through a non-human medium, i.e. The archangel Gabriel, the angel Ruh or another angel. Unseen from behind something; such as the revelation on Prophet Moses (a) on Mount Sinai where it occurred through a tree: [15] \"When he approached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley at the blessed spot from the tree: 'Moses! Indeed I am Allah, the Lord of all the worlds!'\" [16] Tasdidi (Directive) Revelation It is a kind of non-legislative inspiration upon perfect human beings which is known as \"tasdidi (directive) or corrective revelation.\" In these case, a message from God will be received by the heart and the soul of ones who have the competence for it. In these cases, without any oral communication or hearing experience, the person follows this heartfelt message: such as the story of the mother of the Prophet Moses (a) who was inspired to cast her suckling into the river or the revelations received by Infallible Imams (a) and friends of God. Such a revelation is not for telling the rulings, but personal instructions, social guidance, news of the future, to send down composure and certainty and as such which fortify the person's heart. Difference with Satanic Temptation Even though like revelation, satanic temptations are harried, hidden, and mystical, the difference between divine inspirations and satanic temptations is that upon receiving inspiration and divine revelation, a feeling of exhilaration sweeps through the person; while, satanic temptations, due to their opposition to human's nature, bring a sense of dejection and depression. Contemporary Discussions Up to 10th/16th century, believing in the unseen nature of revelation was common among Western scholars. However, with the spread of experimental sciences and materialistic thoughts, some rejected metaphysical nature of revelation. They firstly regarded it superstitious, but a group of them reconsidered about the truth of revelation, and according to the principles of empirical knowledge, regarded it as psychic states and sixth sense of human being and the prophet and the maturity of these people. Some other Western scholars, based on a similar understanding of religious experience and revelation came to this belief that human being, based on his nature, seeks fulfillment of his needs, but problems such as discrimination in world of nature, deficiency of knowledge and morality in human being, the feeling of desolation and problems as such are not the matters all people concern. Therefore, people who have great souls and great concerns gradually retreat from the society and their attention is drawn towards the higher realms. Due to special and severe practices, they come to states other people are unaware of. Accordingly, religion is the spiritual and social experience of the Prophet and the Word of God is the very word of the prophet; thus, revelation depends on the prophet and expands according to the greatness of his personality. In the contemporary time, new discussions and interpretations have been proposed about the phenomenon of revelation and its process. In the Arab world, Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, Muhammad Arkun, Fazlur Rahman Malik, Hasan Hanafi, Muhamamd Khalf Allah and in Iran , 'Abd al-Karim Surush and Mujtahid Shabistari have proposed new interpretations of revelation. Although, these views are not similar and have serious differences, but most of these opinions are common in two factors: one that they do not discuss religious texts outside humanity, history and human culture (not a metaphysical look) and they all want to somehow stress on the role of human being in it and secondly, they regard revelation not adopted from facts and statements, but of encounter and spiritual experience nature. The views proposed by these people have been opposed by advocates of the common Islamic belief.

{"title": "Hereafter", "text": " The Hereafter or Ākhira (Arabic: الآخرة ) is the world after death , or the world after this world. The Hereafter is contrasted to the life in this world. The belief in the Hereafter is deemed a principle of Islam , which means that those who do not believe in the Hereafter do not count as Muslims. The Quran emphasizes the significance of the Hereafter, and the belief in life after death has been a tenet of all religions . It is said that more than one third of Quranic verses are concerned with the afterlife or the Hereafter. In Islamic theological books, the Hereafter is referred to as resurrection , for which transmitted and rational evidence is cited. Muslim scholars have adduced Quranic verses to show that the Hereafter is a world totally different from this world. They attribute specific features to it, including eternity, the distinction between the virtuous and evil-doers, seeing the outcomes of one’s deeds, and enjoyment of blessings in accordance with one’s merits. Some Muslim scholars maintain that the Hereafter begins once life in this world comes to an end, but others believe that the Hereafter exists at present—simultaneously with life in this world—and indeed, it encompasses this world. The Nature of the Hereafter Literally, the term al-akhira (the Hereafter) means the final, the subsequent, or the other. It refers to another world that comes after this world. The Quran describes the afterlife or post-mortem life as the Hereafter (104 times). It sometimes uses phrases such as “the abode of the Hereafter” and “the Last Day.” The Significance of the Belief in the Hereafter The belief in the Hereafter is a principle of the religion and a requirement for being a Muslim. That is, those who deny the Hereafter do not qualify as Muslims. According to Murtada Mutahhari , the second major doctrine—after monotheism —to which all prophets have called people is the belief in the Hereafter. According to Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi , more than one third of Quranic verses are concerned with the Hereafter. The Quran refers to the belief in the Hereafter as a tenet of all prophetical messages . Quranic verses describe the belief in the Hereafter as one of the three tenets of Islam, along with beliefs in God and in the prophet . There is a consensus among all Islamic denominations to the effect that the belief in the Hereafter is an essential of the religion ; that is, those who do not believe in it do not count as Muslims. In Islamic theological books, the Hereafter is discussed in terms of the “principle of resurrection or the return.” There are other issues associated with the Hereafter, including the barzakh (the purgatory), the resurrection , the bridge of sirat , reckoning (hisab), intercession , the Heaven , and the Hell , which figure in the Quran, hadiths , and the writings of Muslim scholars. According to the Quran, a Muslim should believe in all these. Arguments for the Existence of the Hereafter Muslim scholars hold that the main argument for the existence of the Hereafter consists in transmitted or textual evidence, including the revelation . That is, the fact that the prophets are infallible , and they report about the existence of the Hereafter and call people to this belief, is evidence for the existence of the Hereafter. A case in point is verse 7 of Qur'an 64 : “Say, ‘Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected.” According to Murtada Mutahhari , there are other non-transmitted or non-textual means by which one might prove the existence of the Hereafter. At least, they constitute evidence or signs for its existence. He mentions three such means: (1) knowledge of God, (2) knowledge of the world, and (3) knowledge of the human spirit or soul. Philosophical arguments presented by theologians for the existence of the Hereafter include the argument from divine wisdom and the argument from divine justice. The argument from divine wisdom runs as follows: it would be incompatible with the divine wisdom if He limited the human life, which is capable of eternity, to life in this world. This is because God has created human beings so that they could attain the greatest possible excellence or perfection, and this could not be realized in this world, because the existential value of afterlife perfections is incomparable to that of this-worldly perfections. The argument from divine justice proceeds as follows: since the virtuous and evil-doers do not see their proper rewards or punishments in this world, God’s justice requires the existence of another world in which each person receives what they deserve. Characteristics of the Hereafter and Its Difference from This World According to Murtada Mutahhari , there are dozens of Quranic verses concerning issues associated with the Hereafter, including life after death, the day of resurrection , how the dead would be resurrected, the scale, reckoning, records of people’s deeds, the Heaven , the Hell , and the eternity of the Hereafter. Muslim scholars have adduced Quranic verses to show that the Hereafter is radically different from this world and its governing order. In the Hereafter, all people who were born from the beginning to the end of the creation will live at the same time. People in the Hereafter are either absolutely happy or absolutely miserable, the former are provided with whatever they wish to have, and the latter suffer from everything they see as bad or painful. However, life in this world is a mixture of life and death, privilege and deprivation, misery and happiness, suffering and comfort, and sorrow and delight. The following are other characteristics of the Hereafter in accordance with Quranic verses and hadiths : Eternity: According to Quranic verses, the Hereafter is eternal or endless. For instance, verse 34 of Qur'an 50 states that, in the Hereafter, inhabitants of the Heaven are given the good tidings that “This is the day of immortality.” Moreover, in Ghurar al-hikam , Imam 'Ali (a) is quoted as saying that “this world comes to an end, while the Hereafter is eternal.” [22] The distinction between the virtuous and evil-doers: According to Quranic verses, in the Hereafter, the virtuous will be separated from evil-doers: \"And ‘Get apart today, you guilty ones!’\" [23] \"and the faithless will be gathered toward Hell, o that Allah may separate the bad ones from the good [24] \"Those who are wary of their Lord will be led to paradise in throngs.\" [25] \"and drive the guilty as a thirsty herd towards hell\" [26] Seeing the outcomes of one’s deeds: According to Quranic verses, people will see the outcomes of their deeds in the Hereafter: \"and that he will soon be shown his endeavour\" [27] \"So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it. [28] Merit-based privileges: In contrast to this world, in the Hereafter everyone would have what they deserve to have. According to a hadith from Imam 'Ali (a), “circumstances of this world are governed by incidents, while those of the Hereafter are governed by people’s entitlements.” [29] The Scope of the Hereafter There is a disagreement over the scope of the Hereafter: some people believe that it begins with a person’s death and his or her entrance in the world of barzakh (the purgatory). On the other hand, those who maintain that barzakh is not part of the Hereafter say that the latter begins when the world of barzakh comes to an end. Furthermore, theologians believe that the Hereafter occurs in the temporal future of this world; that is, it begins once life in this world comes to an end altogether. However, Muslim philosophers believe that the Hereafter exists at present; that is, it exists alongside life in this world. In other words, the Hereafter is a world with a higher-ranking existence than that of this world, and thus, it encompasses the latter. A Quranic verse adduced by these philosophers is verse 49 of Qur'an 9 : “indeed hell besieges the faithless.” Quranic and Hadith Recommendations about the Hereafter There are recommendations about the Hereafter in Quranic verses and hadiths, including the following: The life of the world is nothing but play and diversion, and the abode of the Hereafter is surely better for those who are Godwary. Do you not exercise your reason? [32] This is the abode of the Hereafter, which We shall grant to those who do not desire to domineer in the earth nor to cause corruption, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary. [33] Bibliography A book is written about the Hereafter by Shaykh 'Abbas Qummi , a scholar in the fourteenth/twentieth century, under Manazil al-akhira (Stations of the Hereafter). In this book, he describes the stages of the Hereafter in the following order: death, grave, barzakh, resurrection, and sirat (the bridge). The book also talks about the scale ( mizan ), reckoning, and punishments of the Hell. It recommends certain worships and moral manners for an easier experience of these afterlife stages. Manazil al-akhira was written in Persian, and it has been translated into Arabic, English, Turkish, and Urdu.

{"title": "Resurrection", "text": " Resurrection (Arabic: معاد , Maʿād) is one of the roots of faith in Islam and means the return of people after death into life on the Day of Judgment ( qiyama ). According to this belief, all of the people will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment and their actions will be judged in the presence of God and they will be requited. Resurrection has a great importance in Islam and nearly one third of Qur'an is about the resurrection and subjects related to it. Believing in the resurrection has a great effect in the manner of life and causes people to do more good and avoid evil. Resurrection could be imagined in two ways: spiritual resurrection, bodily resurrection. The most important objections proposed about the subject is about the rational possibility of resurrection; some of which are: the objection of the eater and the eaten , the objection of returning the extinct , and the objection about the knowledge and the power of God. Qur'an mentions some instances of resurrection in order to prove the possibility of resurrection. Proving the rational possibility of resurrection is possible using rational reasons, like the argument of creation ( fitra ), the argument of wisdom, the argument of justice, and the argument of mercy. Concept Ma'ad (Arabic: معاد ) means to return; and in the terminology of theology , it means revival of people after death, and in judgment day (qiyama) their actions will be judged and the righteous people will reach their reward and the bad people will receive their punishment . Importance Believing in the resurrection influences the life in two ways: Personal life : The main motive of the person's actions is to fulfill the one's needs and wishes, and ultimately to reach an eternal happiness without any suffering. But the behavior of a person is related to the recognition of the goals of life. If someone assumes that the life is only limited to the worldly life, he will put all his efforts in order to reach the worldly joys and to benefit the most from the rich of the world. In contrast, when someone recognizes himself upper than the worldly life and does not acknowledge the death as the end of life, and considers his actions as a road to reach his eternal happiness in the afterlife (akhira), plans his life in a way to be the most beneficent for his eternal life. Social life : The belief in the resurrection, has a great effect on the social life and the mutual behavior of people. Believing in the next life and the eternal reward and punishment, has a great effect on regarding the other's rights and helping the poor. When this belief is accepted in a society, there will be less pressure needed for implementation of the just rules and for prevention of cruelty. Obviously if this belief was globally accepted, the international struggles would be less. The importance of the belief in the resurrection is to the extent that even the monotheism , if not accompanied by believing in the resurrection, is not enough for giving a direction to one's life. This is the reason of the emphasis of the Abrahamic religions on resurrection and the especial effort of divine prophets in the strengthening of the belief in hearts of people. Soul The correct imagination of resurrection is only possible when the true realization of the soul is achieved. In the divine view, the soul is something other than the body and its attributes. It is necessary to note and admit some points about the soul: The soul exists The soul is something substantive , not one of the accidents for the body. The soul is independent from the body and remains alive after the body decomposes. The combination of the soul and the body is not a combination in which with the death of one side, the other side also dies, but the soul is the main part of the existence of human and as far as the soul lives, the identity and the character of the person is preserved. This is the reason why the replacement of the body cells does not compromise the unity of the person; because the true criterion of the unity of a human, is the unity of his soul. The soul is taken by the angel of death ( 'Izra'il ), while the body gradually decomposes and disappears. The Qur'an (32:10-11), mentioning the existence of the soul, answers the objection of deniers of resurrection: “ وَقَالُوا أَإِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِي الْأَرْضِ أَإِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ ۚ بَلْ هُمْ بِلِقَاءِ رَبِّهِمْ كَافِرُونَ (10) قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ They say, 'When we have been lost in the dust, shall we be indeed created anew?' Rather they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord. (10) Say, '{You will not be lost, but} You will be taken away by the angel of death, who has been charged with you. Then you will be brought back to your Lord.' ” — Qur'an, 32:10, 11 Theories Denial of resurrection Some of the old theologians thought that, the resurrection means the returning of the extinct. They thought that when one dies, one completely disappears and becomes extinct; so when the religions announce about the resurrection it means that the human after becoming extinct, will be returned. Proving the resurrection Those who believe in resurrection hold various opinions as follows: Spiritual resurrection only : Islamic Peripatetic philosophers not only considered the bodily resurrection improvable, but also because of rational objections, recognized it as unacceptable. They believed that the resurrection is the return of the soul, without the body, because the body is destroyed after death and only the soul remains. Yet according to Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) the greatest Islamic Peripatetic philosopher, although it is rationally unprovable that the body returns on the Day of Judgment, but because the Prophet (s) had announced it, this is a proof and it must be believed. [5] Bodily resurrection only : According to this view, the whole reality of man is his body and after death it decomposes. in the Judgement Day, this body by divine knowledge and power will reconstruct. In this view there is no resurrection for soul. [6] Spiritual and Bodily resurrection : This view is a kind of combination between previous theories. Supporters of this view explain their idea differently: The return of soul to the very mundane material body The return of the soul to the etheric body The return of the elemental body to the immaterial soul The return of the soul to a developed elemental body The soul creates a body for itself adaptive to its attributes and the world after the Resurrection Resurrection with a Hurqaliya'i body Proving the Resurrection There are two kinds of reasons for proving the resurrection. The first, proves the necessity of the other world, and the second, proves the possibility of the resurrection. Some of the reasons are mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith . Reasons of the Necessity of the Resurrection Reason of the Creation (Fitra) The reason consists of some premises: Every human, by creation ( fitra ), has a desire to be eternal. No desire in human is null, because God is wise and the wise does not do anything null. The worldly life is not eternal So it is necessary to have a permanent world, in which the desire of human to be eternal is satisfied. [7] Reason of Wisdom (Hikma) The reason consists of some premises: Human and the world are creations of God Creations of God are not null God has created the world in such a manner that the most goodness possible is accomplished. The material world, is a mixture of good and evil that are in struggle with each other. Human, has an immortal soul and can reach a permanent goodness. If the life is limited to this world, the aim of God from the creation of the world is not fulfilled, because there's no benefit in making a thing, then destroying it. So knowing that God is wise, there must be another world beyond this worldly life, so that the aim of the creation is satisfied, especially due to many difficulties in this worldly life, so even if the permanent continuation of the worldly life was possible, it was not compatible with the wisdom of God. The reason is mentioned in Qur'an (44:38-41): “ وَ ما خَلَقْنَا السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضَ وَ ما بَینَهُما لاعِبینَ (38) ما خَلَقْناهُما إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَ لکنَّ أَکثَرَهُمْ لا یعْلَمُونَ (39) إِنَّ یوْمَ الْفَصْلِ میقاتُهُمْ أَجْمَعینَ We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them for play (38) We did not create them except with reason; but most of them do not know (39) Indeed the Day of Judgement is the tryst for them all. ” — Qur'an, 44:38-40 Reason of Mercy God is merciful ; The mercy of God covers all of His creatures; Covering of the God's mercy to all of creatures requires that every creature has a chance to activate its talents; Human achieves the maturity and gains the ability to benefit from spiritual gifts; This world, because of its limits, does not have the capacity of the spiritual gifts. So there have to be another world in which everyone can benefit from the results of the maturity one has achieved. In Qur'an (6:12) this reason is mentioned: “ قُلْ لِمَنْ ما فِی السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضِ قُلْ لِلَّهِ کتَبَ عَلی نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ لَیجْمَعَنَّکمْ إِلی یوْمِ الْقِیامَةِ لا رَیبَ فیهِ الَّذینَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لا یؤْمِنُونَ Say, 'To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?' Say, 'To Allah. He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself. He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Those who have ruined their souls1 will not have faith.' ” — Qur'an, 6:12 Reason of Justice One of the attributes of God is Justice; In the worldly life people have free will to choose between good and bad actions; Some people have used their freedom to worship God and serve of others; and in contrast, there are criminals who have chased their lust in their lifetime and have committed the worst sins; The divine justice of God requires that everyone sees the results of his actions, good people get rewarded, and the bad get their punishment. This world does not have the capacity that people see the requital of their actions; as most of the people do not see the punishment or the reward of their actions in their life; Therefore, as this world is for the test of people and fulfilling the tasks God had appointed them to; there must be another world for people to see the results of their actions, so that the justice of God be fulfilled. In the Qur'an, in some verses, the difference of the good people and the bad, and their different destinations, is mentioned (45:21-22): “ أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذینَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّیئاتِ أَنْ نَجْعَلَهُمْ کالَّذینَ آمَنُوا وَ عَمِلُوا الصَّالِحاتِ سَواءً مَحْیاهُمْ وَ مَماتُهُمْ ساءَ ما یحْکمُونَ (21) وَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ وَ لِتُجْزی کلُّ نَفْسٍ بِما کسَبَتْ وَ هُمْ لا یظْلَمُونَ Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make! (21) Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. ” — Qur'an, 45:21-22 Reasons of the Possibility of the Resurrection In the Qur'an different occurrences of the dead returning to life is mentioned, so that the believers in the Qur'an are assured that the resurrection is possible and feasible, and God is able to do it. The cases of the dead becoming alive mentioned in the Qur'an are: Companions of the Cave : The story of the companions of the cave is mentioned in the Qur'an, Allah introduces the reason of their second life and the discovery of people about them, for that people know that there is no doubt about the occurrence of the resurrection. “ وَکذَلِک أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَیهِمْ لِیعْلَمُوا أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَا رَیبَ فِیهَا Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make! (21) Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. ” — Qur'an, 45:21-22 Resurrection Miracles of Jesus In the Qur'an the miracles of Jesus ('Isa) (a) is mentioned, that he was rising the dead, with the permission of God (3:49): “ وَ أُبْرِئُ الْأَکمَهَ وَ الْأَبْرَصَ وَ أُحْی الْمَوْتی بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ And I heal the blind and the leper and I revive the dead by Allah's leave. ” — Qur'an, 3:49 Budding of the Plants The budding of the plants in the spring after they became dry in the autumn is similar to the resurrection of human after death. Qur'an (30:50) considers the budding of the plants as an example of the rising of the dead: “ فَانظُرْ إِلَی آثَارِ رَحْمَتِ اللَّهِ کیفَ یحْیی الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا إِنَّ ذَلِک لَمُحْیی الْمَوْتَی وَهُوَ عَلَی کلِّ شَیءٍ قَدِیرٌ So observe the effects of Allah's mercy: how He revives the earth after its death! Indeed He is the reviver of the dead, and He has power over all things. ” — Qur'an, 30:50 Also there are other instances of the resurrection mentioned in the Qur'an such as the resurrection of birds for Prophet Ibrahim (a) and resurrection of 'Uzayr , one hundred years after death. Resurrection in the Qur'an Importance of the Resurrection in the Qur'an More than one third of the verses of Qur'an , are about the eternal life; these verses could be categorized in seven categories: Verses that state the necessity of believing in the afterlife ( akhira ) [11] Verses that state the harsh results of rejecting the resurrection. [12] Verses that mention the eternal gifts of the paradise [13] Verses that mention the punishments of the hell [14] Verses that note the connection of good and bad actions with the destination in the afterlife Verses that describe the possibility and the necessity of the resurrection Verses answered the questions and objections of the deniers of the resurrection Verses that state that the root of all the crimes and the deviances is the denial of the resurrection. [15] Most of the dialogues and advices of the prophets to their people was on the subject of the resurrection. Their effort to prove the resurrection was even more than monotheism ; because the resistance of people in accepting this subject is more than other beliefs. Roots of the Denial of the Resurrection In the Qur'an's view, the root of some people's denial of the resurrection is: Materialism : In the view of materialists, every incorporeal subject is denied. Tendency to irresponsibility : the psychological motive of tendency to irresponsibility and immorality, causes the denial of the resurrection; because believing in the resurrection and the Day of Judgment is a powerful factor for feeling responsibility and accepting the moral limitations and self-controlling. On the contrary, denying the resurrection opens all the gates to all of evil (Qur'an, 75:5): “ أَ یحْسَبُ الْإِنْسانُ أَلَّنْ نَجْمَعَ عِظامَهُ (3) بَلی قادِرِینَ عَلی أَنْ نُسَوِّی بَنانَهُ (4) بَلْ یرِیدُ الْإِنْسانُ لِیفْجُرَ أَمامَهُ Does man suppose that We shall not put together his bones? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to proportion [even] his fingertips! (4) Rather, man desires to go on living viciously. ” — Qur'an, 75:5 Some theoretical objections : there has been some theoretical objections about the possibility of the resurrection due to some ambiguity in resurrection and how it will occur. Answer to Some Objections Objection of the Eater and the Eaten According to the objection of the eater and the eaten, which is one of the oldest objections about the bodily resurrection, if a person becomes the food for another person, in the time of the resurrection, will the eaten parts be in the body of the eater or in the body of the eaten? Either way, the body of one of them will not be resurrected completely. Based on this objection, the Peripatetic philosophers believed that the bodily resurrection is not rationally provable. But the theologians attempted to answer the objection. Most of the theologians, differentiated between the primary and secondary parts of body, and claimed that the primary parts of human body never become part of the body of another. Mulla Sadra , proposing the theory of the imaginal body, which is not a subject to this objection, offered another expression for the bodily resurrection. Objection of the Returning of the Extinct One of the objections discussed about the resurrection is that when a human dies, his/her body becomes extinct. Then, if the resurrection is true, so God has to return something that is extinct; and because the return of the extinct is rationally impossible, so is the resurrection. In Qur'an the objection and its answer is mentioned (32:10-11): “ وَقَالُوا أَئِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِی الْأَرْضِ أَئِنَّا لَفِی خَلْقٍ جَدِیدٍ بَلْ هُم بِلِقَاء رَبِّهِمْ کافِرُونَ (10) قُلْ یتَوَفَّاکم مَّلَک الْمَوْتِ الَّذِی وُکلَ بِکمْ ثُمَّ إِلَی رَبِّکمْ تُرْجَعُونَ They say, 'When we have been lost in the dust, shall we be indeed created anew?' Rather they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord (10) Say, 'You will be taken away by the angel of death, who has been charged with you. Then you will be brought back to your Lord.' ” — Qur'an, 32:10-11 So the resurrection is the return of the existing soul not something extinct. Objection about the knowledge and the power of God and the ability of body In the objection, it is stated that every action need a doer and also an object to which the action be applied. If the resurrection is going to be done, on the one hand, there must be someone with enough knowledge and power to do so, and on the other hand, the body must have the ability to be returned, while the life has its own conditions which becomes available gradually, like an embryo in a womb with appropriate conditions gradually becomes complete and turns into a human; but in a body which is dead and disjointed such a condition is not present so it cannot come back to life. Qur'an answered the objection in some verses, in some, compared the resurrection to the germination of seeds from the soil, and in some other compared the resurrection with the first creation of human (22:5); and so mentions the infinite knowledge of God and His power to resurrect the people; so it is possible that a rotten body which is turned into soil rises and comes back to life: “ یا أَیهَا النَّاسُ إِنْ کنْتُمْ فِی رَیبٍ مِنَ الْبَعْثِ فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاکمْ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ نُطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ مُضْغَةٍ مُخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَیرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ لِنُبَینَ لَکمْ... وَتَرَی الْأَرْضَ هَامِدَةً فَإِذَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَیهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنْبَتَتْ مِنْ کلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِیجٍ O people! If you are in doubt about the resurrection, [consider that] WE indeed created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then from a clinging mass, then from a fleshy tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest [Our power] to you... And you see the earth torpid, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells, and grows every delightful kind [of plant]. ” — Qur'an, 22:5 About the ability of the dead body for becoming alive again, it must be said that the rules and the system present in the world is not the only system possible, and the rules and causes known in the world are not the only rules and causes for the occurrences, as there have occurred many extraordinary occurrences like the livening of dead people and animals, some of which are mentioned in the Qur'an. Qur'an (20:51-52) says about the infinite knowledge of God: “ قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَی (51) قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّی فِی کتَابٍ لَّا یضِلُّ رَبِّی وَلَا ینسَی He (Pharaoh) said, 'What about the former generations?' (51) He (Moses) said, 'Their knowledge is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord neither makes any error nor forgets.' ” — Qur'an, 20:51-52 See also Usul al-din Hereafter Day of Separation Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related Death Related and Tribes and Groups Others Common principles of Islam Specific principles of Shia"}
{"title": "Hell", "text": "Hell or Jahannam (Arabic: جَهنَّم ) is a place in the afterlife in which evil-doers will be punished . The place or parts of it are referred to in the Qur'an also as \" Jaḥīm \" ( الجَحیم ), \"Saqar\" ( السقَر ), \"Sa'īr\" ( السعیر ), and in many cases, it is referred to as \"al-Nar\" ( النار , the Fire). The Hell is not only mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths ; it is also discussed in Islamic disciplines such as theology , philosophy , and theoretical mysticism . Lexicology The word, \"Jahannam\", literally means a very deep pit. It refers to a fire with which God will punish the sinners in the afterlife . In the terminology of the Qur'an, it refers to the location of afterlife punishments where evil-doers and unbelievers will be punished. Most Muslim lexicographers take \"Jahannam\" to have a non-Arabic root, while some of them take it to have an Arabic origin. Isma'il b. Hammad al-Jawhari and al-Raghib al-Isfahani take it to be a persian word. Al-Raghib takes the original form of \"Jahannam\" to be \"Jahannām\" ( جَهَنّام , a Persian word which means a deep pit). Ibn Athir, Ibn Manzur, and al-Suyuti speculate that the word has a Hebrew origin; they hold that it is derived from the Hebrew word, \"Kihinnām\". Contemporary western researchers take the word to be originated from the Hebrew word, \"Gehennom\" (גיהנום), or \"Jihinum\" which means the valley of Banu Hinum. Hell in Eschatology In eschatology, the Hell is taken to be the worst place as opposed to the Heaven which is taken to be the best place. The Heaven is home to all the good, and the Hell is home to all the sufferings. Agents of the Hell All agents of the Hell are angels and servants who absolutely obey God . In the Islamic doctrine, there is no Hell the control of which is in the hands of devils. The Hell is totally ruled and controlled by God. According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Hell is a torture for the sinners and is a mercy for its agents who work inside it. The main guard of the Hell who is called \"Malik\" ( مالك ) is characterized in hadiths as being very ugly and stinky. The 19 guards of the Hell to which the Qur'an refers are characterized as being so frightening that if an earthly person looked at them, he or she would die immediately. The Philosophy of the Hell The main question concerning the Hell is why evil-doers should endure such a hard and long punishment which is not comparable to hardships of this world with respect to its strength and eternity. Guarantee for religious ruling The fear of the Hell is taken by religious doctrines to be a performance bond for religious rulings. The Qur'an has asked people to fear the Hell and protect themselves and their family from its fire. Punishment for actions Several Qur'anic verses consider the Hell to be a \"punishment\" for one's evil actions. In addition to frequent terms that imply punishment, the term, \"nakal\" ( نَکال , reprisal) is also used, and God has been even characterized as being \"muntaqim\" ( مُنتَقِم , avenger). Embodiment of actions According to the doctrine of the Embodiment of Actions , the punishment endured by evil-doers is, in fact, the real form of their own actions, and it is the actions themselves which take the forms of punishments and bring sufferings to them. No suffering is imposed on anyone from the outside; rather the punishment is the result of their own actions. The notion of the Embodiment of Actions is implied by some Qur'anic verses; however, it is most obviously stated in Sura al-Zilzal (99):8: \"And anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it\" . In another verse of the Qur'an, usurping the possessions of an orphan is identified with eating the fire. From Death to the Resurrection After his death, the sinner endures sufferings in Barzakh (a world between this world and afterlife) until the resurrection . Then a divine court of justice is held on Dooms Day; those who deserve the Heaven will not suffer from the Hell, and evil-doers will be punished after being tried. However, some Islamic texts talk about immediate transfer to the Hell after death; it is as if the fire of the Hell lurks beyond the death. Such a picture is given about the people of the prophets Noah (a) and Lot (a) ; they were immediately moved to the Hell after they died by a divine punishment in this world. The Hell is said not to wait for evil-doers to go to it; rather it lurks in ambush for them. When evil-doers are about to enter the Hell, its fire flames. And when the divine court of justice is held after the resurrection, the Hell is brought to the scene. On Dooms Day, the Hell is presented to the evil-doers. They will see the Hell and know that they will be thrown into it, feeling the suffering before entering it. The sufferings of the Hell are referred to in the Qur'an as \"'Adhab yawm 'azim\" (the punishment of a tremendous day), \"'Adhab yawm 'aqim\" (the punishment of an inauspicious day), and \"'Adhab yawm kabir\" (the punishment of a great day) as attributed to the day of resurrection. The Hell acts like a hunter: some of its flames go out to capture certain groups of sinners and devour them. The flame is characterized as having two eyes and a fluently talking tongue. Such flames are commissioned to hunt three groups of sinners: obstinate tyrants, those who bothered God and His prophet, and those who make idols. Sometimes the picture is given with more details: there are flames that capture the murderers of Imam al-Husayn (a) , just like a bird that picks seeds from the ground, and take them inside the fire. The Hell is greedy to devour the sinners, and however many evil-doers are thrown inside it, it asks more by saying \"are there any more?\". The Hell lurks in ambush for every person. There is no person present at the day of the resurrection who does not enter it. However, one can find his or her way out of it provided that they have attained salvation. Some hadiths have elaborated this doctrine by talking about a hazardous bridge that goes through the Hell; those who have attained salvation will successfully cross the bridge, and the sinners will fall from it into the Hell. The bridge is characterized as being as narrow as the edge of a sword. Inspired by some Qur'anic verses, the bridge is sometimes called the Sirat . Groups of People Who Enter the Hell In some general statements in religious texts, it is said that many people from human beings and jinn will be punished in the Hell, but in other texts, the instances of people who are punished in the hell are specified with more detail. Polytheism and unbelief : the prime instance of people who are punished in the Hell are polytheists, [40] because polytheism is the biggest sin. [41] Those who take a creature as their god will burn in the fire of the Hell together with what they worshiped. [42] Some rare hadiths have even talked about the sun and the moon being thrown into the Hell, because they were worshiped by some people. [43] Sometimes it is said that unbelievers will be thrown into the Hell, and sometimes obstinate unbelievers are said to enter the Hell. [44] The notion of obstinacy is sometimes cashed out in terms of falsifying the signs of God [45] and ridiculing the divine signs. [46] Arrogance : arrogance is a sin with which many people of the Hell are characterized. [47] In some hadiths, the aspects of such arrogance are delineated. [48] For example, there is a hadith according to which most people in the Hell are arrogant people and tyrants. [49] Brutal rulers: it frequently appears in many hadiths that the first people who enter the Hell are brutal rulers. The theme appears in different Shiite [50] and Sunni [51] sources of hadiths. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) according to which a brutal leader is in the bottom of the Hell and will be punished in the most severe way. [52] Assistants of brutal rulers: people who lean towards brutal rulers [53] and guide them through their brutal acts [54] will be thrown in the Hell along with their bosses. [55] Other descriptions of the people of the Hell refer to the above notion: \"taghi\" ( , disobedient), \"mutrif\" ( , indulged in luxury), and \"musrif\" ( , extravagant). Sinners : one feature of the people of the Hell is that they are sinners and evil-doers, that is, they disobey God and His prophet. [59] The most important sin because of which people go to the Hell is the violation of the rights of people , such as killers of innocent people, [60] faultfinding people, gossipers, [61] and stingy collectors of wealth. [62] In hadiths, other groups of sinners are mentioned over and above the ones mentioned in the Qur'an. [63] The lusts and appetites lead one to the neglect of the horrors of the Hell. [64] Companionship with Sinners: According to some hadiths, people who have committed similar sins will be one another's companions in the Hell. That is, in addition to individual punishments, there is collective punishment as well. The Qur'an frequently talks about nations [65] or groups [66] entering the fire or about people being gathered to the Hell. [67] Although such groups are companions, the Qur'an has mentioned that they talk to each other in a hostile way and express their hate to one another. [68] Dwelling Forever In the initial picture given of the Hell, its dwellers can never go out of it and will be punished there forever. What reinforces this initial picture is that there is no death in the afterlife; dwellers of the Hell will never die, although all conditions that lead to death in this world are present. They do not die, and they never go out of fire. There is a hadith according to which the death is brought to the scene on Dooms Day in the form of a goat—in a way that everyone will recognize it as death—and it is slaughtered, so that people are disappointed from getting rid of their sufferings by death. There are many Qur'anic verses concerning the eternal punishment in the Hell for evil-doers. The Hell is sometimes referred to as \"Dar al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , House of Eternity) and \"'Adhab al-Khuld\" ( عذاب الخلد , Eternal Punishment). According to some People of the Book , those who enter the Hell will only be punished there for a few days and they will then be saved from the fire. However, their belief is strongly reproached in the Qur'an . However, there are few remarks in the Qur'an that led some Muslims to the belief that there are temporary punishments in the Hell as well. Sura al-An'am (6):128 talks about some people dwelling in the Hell forever, but it then qualifies it with the phrase: \"except what God wills\". Thus, some exegetes of the Qur'an maintained that some dwellers of the Hell might find a way out of it one day. There is also a Qur'anic verse according to which sinners \"will dwell therein for ages (ahqab, أحقاب)\" (78:23). This verse has also led some exegetes to believe that the Hell will be a temporary place, at least, for some of its dwellers. According to a hadith , \"I swear to God no one will be saved from the Fire unless they stay there for \"ahqab\" ( أحقاب , ages), each \"haqb\" ( حقب , age) being over 80 years. And if the dwellers of the Hell are told that they would stay there for as many years as all the sands in the world, they would still be delighted\". Dwellers of the Hell who will be saved from the fire after enduring some suffering for their evil actions are considered by some hadiths to be Muslim sinners. According to some hadiths, whoever has a little bit of belief or faith in their heart will be saved from the fire one day. And sometimes people are saved from the Hell by the intercession of some saints of God, while they have turned into ashes in the Hell. Features of the Hell Types of Punishment mentioned in the Qur'an Fire: the most important punishment with which the Hell is known is a burning fire. Some verses of the Qur'an talk about evil-doers falling into the fire, instead of falling into the Hell. However, the Qur'an highlights the peculiarity of this fire by characterizing it as \"burning fire\" or \"lidded fire\" that cooks the skin and leaves nothing. The fire is known as \"Nar Allah\" (the fire of God) and has flaming pillars, and unlike earthly fires, it starts from hearts and it flames outwards, rather than inwards. Its firewood are the human beings themselves. According to some Qur'anic verses, there is a fire that has human beings and stones as its firewood. Fire-related punishments: some punishments in the Hell are related to fire; for instance, \"samum\" ( سموم ) which is fierce blast of fire, and \"hamim\" ( حمیم ) which is boiling water which dwellers of the Hell have to drink, and it will be poured on their heads. Their clothes are also from fire or burning materials such as \"qatiran\" ( قطران , melted tar) and \"hamim\" . Food and drink: the Qur'an and hadiths have mentioned some of what the dwellers of the Hell will eat and drink. Unlike foods and drinks in the Heaven which are characterized with what is familiar to earthly ones, those in the Hell are characterized with unfamiliar terms, such as \"Zaqqum\" ( زقّوم ) which is a kind of tree, \"ghislin\" ( غسلین ) which is taken by the exegetes of the Qur'an to be filth, pus, and corruption from the washing of the wounds, \"dari'\" ( ضریع ) which is thorns or thorny fruit, and drinks such as \"ghassaq\" ( غساق ) which is paralyzing cold water, \"sadid\" ( صدید ) which is fetid or festering water, and \"shurb al-him\" ( شرب الهیم ), which is drinking like a thirsty camel. These terms have been difficult for the exegetes to explain. However, their general feature is that they do not quench thirst or feed up the person, they are stuck in one's throat, and tear up the viscera. Other punishments: there are other punishments in the Hell, such as chains and shackles , iron mace, whips, horrifying sounds in the Hell, tightness of the space, the feeling of pressure, and shadows which are fiercer than the fire. And many more punishments. Types of Punishment Mentioned in the Hadith There are more details in hadiths: for example, there is said to be prisons in the Hell with peculiar punishments, and they are called the prison of Bulas ( بولس ) or Falaq ( فلق ). There are descriptions of snakes and scorpions in the Hell which have been questionable for critics. Some snakes are introduced with their names. Of drinks in the Hell, \"tinat al-khiyal\" (essence of corruption) is mentioned, which is extracted from dwellers of the Hell themselves. There are hadiths about the feeling of disgust by eating and drinking in the Hell. Also, a mill is mentioned which grinds religious scholars who did not practice what they knew. \"Zamharir\", which is a Qur'anic word regarding the Heaven, has been used in hadiths in a different meaning, referring to a land in the Hell with a horrible, freezing cold which tears the bodies of the evil-doers into pieces. According to a hadith, people of the Hell take refuge to Zamharir in order to escape the fire, but they suffer even more in there, and so they beg God to return them to the fire. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, the Qur'anic verse according to which dwellers of the Hell will stay there forever \"except what God wills\" refers to them going to Zamharir for a while during their punishments. Gates and Floors of the Hell The Qur'an frequently points out that the Hell has gates. In one case, it says that the Hell has 7 gates each of which has an \"assigned portion\", that is, they are assigned to different classes of sinners. Some verses also refer to floors and stages of the Hell, for example \"the lowest stage (al-darak al-asfal) of the fire\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have taken \"al-darak al-asfal\" to refer to the lowest stage or floor of the Hell. Some lexicographers and exegetes point out that \"darakat\" with respect to the Hell are counterparts of \"darajat\" (degrees) with respect to the Heaven. However, the word, \"darajat\", has been used about the Hell as well. Some exegetes, such as ibn Jurayh, take the 7 gates to refer to the 7 stages (darakat) of the Hell. This is confirmed in a hadith as well. Some exegetes take the different names for the fires of the Hell to refer to these 7 stages or floors: \"Jahannam\", \"Laza\" ( لظی , flames of the fire), \"Hutama\" ( حطمة , that which crushes and breaks into pieces), \"Sa'ir\" ( سعیر , blazing fire), \"Saqar\" ( سقر , scorching fire), \"Jahim\" ( جحیم , hell fire), and \"Hawiya\" ( هاویة , bottomless pit). However, there is no agreement over their order. There are hadiths that characterize these stages individually; for example, \"Saqar\" is where arrogant people will dwell, and \"Sa'ir\" is where killers will be punished. Other Places of Hell In addition to \"darakat\" (or stages) of the Hell, there are some Qur'anic terms occurring in verses related to the Hell which are taken in some hadiths to refer to specific locations in the Hell. For example, the word, \"Sa'ud\" ( صعود , hard ascent or mount of calamities) in the Qur'an, Sura al-Muddaththir (74):17, is taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, the word, \"'Aqaba\" ( عقبة , height or ascent) is also taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, \"Hufra min al-nar\" (a pit of fire) as a pit in the Hell, \"Falaq\" as a pit in the Hell in which people are punished in different ways, \"Wayl\" as a horrifying valley or a pit in the Hell which it takes 40 years for one to reach its bottom, \"Ghayy\" ( غیّ ) as a valley in the Hell, \"Ghassaq\" ( غساق ) as a river or a valley full of scorpions, \"Atham\" ( اثام ) as a valley in the Hell, and \"Mawbiq\" ( موبق ) as a river of pus and blood in the Hell. There are other locations in the Hell mentioned in hadiths, such as the Pit of Sadness (Huzn, حزن ) from which the Hell itself escapes, the Pit of Habhab ( هبهب ) located in the valley of Saqar in which tyrants dwell, the Sakran ( سکران ) mountain and its valley, Ghadban ( غضبان ), in which there are coffins of fire, and a coffin of fire in the bottom of the Hell in which 6 people from the ancient time and 6 people from the Umma of Prophet Muhammad (s) are punished. Some Imami and Sunni scholars of hadiths have written independent books regarding the Hell and the Heaven, such as Sifat al-janna wa l-nar (Features of the Heaven and the Hell) by Sa'id b. Jinah which is the oldest book in this regard available to us. Humiliation and Deprivation According to Qur'anic doctrines, just as neglectful indulgence in mundane pleasures is punished by deprivation in the Hell, arrogance and tyranny in this world is punished by humiliation in there. From the very beginning, the way evil-doers are thrown into the fire is accompanied by humiliation, as implied by phrases such as \"falling into the fire\" , \"outcast into the fire\", \"being grabbed by the head or by the feet\" and the like. And when they are being punished, they are humiliated by different sufferings; for example, \"'Adhab al-hun\" ( عذاب الهون , humiliating punishment) is a punishment mentioned in the Qur'an for arrogance and tyranny. One manifestation of such humiliation is seen in evil-doers being reproached by the guards of the Hell as well as in a conversation between the dwellers of the Hell and the dwellers of the Heaven , as appearing in the Qur'an. The most significant deprivation of the dwellers of the Hell is that God never talks to them, which makes them forlorn in the Hell. There are Qur'anic verses in this regard according to which dwellers of the Hell ask the guards to pray for them to God, and when the guards disappoint them, they pray to God on their own. The Qur'an says that their requests, cries, wishes of ransoms for release, and wishes of another opportunity to return to this world and compensate their actions are not heard by God. It is repeatedly emphasized that dwellers of the Hell receive no help, have no new opportunity, and are not given any safety conduct . According to a sermon attributed to Imam Ali (a) regarding the features of the Hell: \"it is a house where no mercy can be found and no praying by its dwellers is heard\". There are some hadiths, however, to the effect that in some exceptional cases their praying is heard by God: for example, the one according to which there is a servant of God in the Hell who kept calling God as \"Ya Hannan, Ya Mannan\" (O the Charitable, O the Benefactor) for a thousand years. Finally, God sends Jabra'il to him to answer his calls and forgives him. In Islamic Theology The issue of rewards and punishments in the afterlife, and in particular, the issue of the Hell, constitute a large portion of theological works. There are some common theological issues regarding the Hell or Heaven, as there are specific issues about either of the two. Whether the Hell and the Heaven exist now: one theological question is whether the Hell and Heaven are already created or not. The question seems to be posed by Hisham al-Futi for the first time; he asked the question because he thought there was no point for the Hell or the Heaven to exist before the resurrection . Some scholars of the Mu'tazila , Najjariyya , and scholars associated with the Mu'tazila, such as Zaydiyya and Khawarij took al-Futi's question seriously and maintained that the Hell and the Heaven might not already be created; it is, indeed, possible for them to exist or not exist now. Some people, such as Abu Hashim al-Juba'i agreed with al-Futi, and some of the Mu'tazila, such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i and Abu l-Hasan al-Basri as well as Imami and Ash'ari theologians maintained that the Hell and the Heaven already exist. Eternity and immortality: another common question about the Hell and the Heaven is that of their eternity and immortality. The question was posed by Juham b. Safwan on the ground that it is not possible for a contingent entity to be infinite. Jahiz allegedly believed that there is no eternal dwelling in the Hell and that the dwellers of the Hell will eventually turn into fire. However, proponents of the eternity of the Hell and the Heaven tried to reply to objections by appeal to philosophical and theological reasoning as well as rhetorical arguments . Wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell: along with the theological issue of infallibility in the Heaven and the voluntary or involuntary abstinence from wrong-doing in there, there is a theological issue about wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell. One important theory in this respect is the theory of ilja', according to which God forces the dwellers of the Hell to quit wrong-doings, and so their abstinence is not praiseworthy. However, others believe that their abstinence from wrong-doings is because of their lack of motivations for such actions. They believe that only wrong-doing without any obstinacy towards God is possible in the afterlife. Committers of major sins in the Hell: this is a ramification of the old question about people who commit major sins. Khawarij take committers of major sins to be unbelievers if they do not repent to God, and so for them, there is no significant difference between the position of an unbeliever and a committer of a major sin who did not repent to God. Of Khawarij, Najda b. 'Amir who was more modest believed that it is possible for such evil-doers to suffer a punishment in accordance with their sins outside the Hell and then enter the Heaven. In his view, the Hell is only home to unbelievers and so a Muslim evil-doer does not enter the Hell. His view was later revised by some of the Murji'a. Muqatil b. Sulayman believed that Muslim committers of major sins suffer the Hell from a distance on the Sirat bridge and will suffer in accordance with their sins, and will then go to the Heaven without entering the Hell. The view of the Mu'tazila about the punishment of Muslim wrong-doers is grounded in their position concerning Manzila bayn al-Manzilatayn (a position between the two positions). Most of the Mu'tazila believed that in the afterlife, all people are only divided into two groups: people of the Heaven and people of the Hell, and so for them, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell just like the unbelievers, except that their punishment will be milder than that of the unbelievers. According to Imami and Ash'ari theologians, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell if they are not forgiven by God and will be punished in accordance with their sins and will then go to the Heaven until no monotheist remains in the Hell. They take \"khulud\" in the Qur'an to mean a long, rather than an eternal, stay in the Hell. Some of the Mu'tazila have the same view, adding that it does not fit the divine justice for monotheist wrong-doers to stay in the Hell forever. Some Imami theologians deny that such wrong-doers will go to the Heaven, although they do believe that they will finally go out of the Hell. He identified such an intermediate position between the Hell and the Heaven with what is called \" A'raf \" or \" Barzakh \" in the Qur'an. The goodness of the Hell: one theological question about the Hell is whether eternal punishment in the Hell is good. The question is taken seriously by later Mu'tazili theologians. In the school of Basra , scholars such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i believed that punishment in the Hell is neither good, nor bad, and it is a matter of convention to call it good or bad. But in the school of Baghdad , people such as Abu Ja'far al-Iskafi believed that punishment in the Hell is good and is a divine mercy even for unbelievers who suffer them. In Islamic Sufism and Mysticism Muslim mystics, just like the people of sharia, take the Hell to be a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the Hell. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the sharia as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers. Early Sufis emphasized the fear of God, detachment from this world, thinking about death, and the punishment of sinners. They exhibited fear of the consequences of committing sins, and remorse and shame as well as buka' (crying) because of their sins. In this ascetic Sufism, fear is preferred to hope due to its stronger impact on one's will, ascetic life, and the awakening of the soul. Such themes became more interior in the views of Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya. She emphasized the fear of divine punishment and believed that such a fear should be a believer's guide. She replaced the fear of eternal punishment or hope of eternal reward by the eternal love of God and His servitude. In fact, a Sufi's ideal is love of, and unification with, God. Thus, sins make one separated from God and the Hell is, indeed, the separation from God, which is the biggest deprivation. They even believe that if the blessings of the Heaven are to prevent one from seeing the divine beauty, a lover of God had better go to the Hell and see His beauty. In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God. The highest desideratum for them was divine love and satisfaction. Dhu l-Nun al-Misri believed that fear of the Hell was nothing compared to the fear of separation from God. Sufis emphasized that the fire of the Hell has nothing to do with real believers and lovers of God. In the remarks of Sufis, there are expressions such as the Hell of separation, the suffering of distance from the Beloved, the Hell of distance, and the humility of distance which are used in contrast to the suffering or fire of the Hell. They imply that the real suffering is that of distance from God, which is taken by Sufis to be a painful punishment. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are only psychological states of the soul after its separation from the body. A soul is prosperous or miserable to the degree to which they know God. The humiliating punishment of the soul can cease by the removal of the distance, that is, by the removal of one's ignorance of God.

{"title": "Ihbat", "text": "Iḥbāṭ (Arabic: إحباط ) means the cancellation of the reward of obedience and good deeds due to committing sins . Theologians of the Mu'tazila school of thought believe that if a Muslim performs an act of obedience to Allah , and thereafter commits a sin such that the sin's punishment exceeds the good deed's reward, then the sin destroys the reward of obedience in such a way that it is as if the person had never performed any good deed at all, and does not deserve any reward whatsoever. However, according to them, if the reward of a sinner weighs more than his sin, the issue of \" takfir \" (expiation) arises, which means that the reward overpowers and conceals the sin. Prominent Shi'a theologians do not agree with this view. Literal Meaning Ihbat is an infinitive which means the destruction or obliteration of the reward of an act. As ihbat is a transitive verb, it means to cancel or to destroy the reward of an act. Quranic Meaning Verbs that are derived from the two origins 'Habata' and 'Ihbat' appear in the Qur'an 16 times in varied forms and all of them are regarding an act. Their applied meaning is obtained by looking at the indicators mentioned in the Quranic verses and reading them as transitive or intransitive to mean an act to be annulled or to annul an act. In the Quran, it is mentioned for the following people: Those who are attached to the worldly life and drowned in its enjoyment; Spiritually sick believers who secretly take non-believers as their guardians Non-believers who scare the believers from war and when the fear of war is averted, want its booty ; Those who kill the Prophets; Those who disbelieve in the verses of the Quran and call it a lie; People who turn away from religion and faith ; Those who have become disbelievers and close the path of God towards them; People who want to invoke the wrath of God; Those who dislike what is sent down by God; Polytheists as well as believers who associate partners with God; Believers who raise their voices higher than that of the Prophet (s) in his presence. Viewpoint of Mu'tazila The theologians of the Mu'tazila school of thought believe in the concept of Ihbat due to their belief in the core of God's promise of reward and punishment ( wa'd and wa'id ) and have used various arguments to prove it. However, they differ among themselves in the details. Viewpoint of Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar Hamadani (d. 415 /1024-5) was a noted Mu'tazilite theorist in proving the authenticity of the matter of ihbat and takfir. He first stated that the measure of one's sins and good deeds are never equal. In other words, it cannot be that the reward and punishment of a person be of the same and equal amount because in the hereafter there is not a third place besides heaven and hell . Now, if such a person is sent to hell, he is treated unjustly, and if he is sent to heaven, then two possibilities arise; One: he will either be rewarded- which is not acceptable because rewarding somebody who does not deserve it is obnoxious Two: God would grace them like He does the children and the insane- which is also not acceptable because his case is different from theirs. Thus, there are following kinds of people mentioned in this premise; a person who was always obedient to God and so in the hereafter too, deserves to be rewarded; or a person who was always disobedient and a sinner and therefore will receive divine punishment. But the problem arises for a person who obeyed as well as disobeyed God. Regarding such a person, it is supposed that: He is neither worthy of reward, nor punishment and therefore doesn't experience reward or punishment. He is worthy of both reward and punishment and thus experiences both reward and punishment at the same time. The concept of ihbat and takfir is applied where the greater measure conquers the lesser one and annuls it. The first supposition is not correct as it is against the consensus of the umma (nation in its Islamic sense). The second one too, is unlikely because it is not possible for a person to face reward and punishment at the same time. Hence, the only remaining possibility is that if the reward is greater, it will cancel the sin or if the sin is greater, it will overcome the reward. Difference Between Mu'tazila and Khawarij According to the Mu'tazila, only a greater sin can destroy and obliterate an act of obedience because unlike the Khawarij , they believe in the existence of smaller sins . However, they add a clause which says that God does not show us the exact smaller sin committed by us because such an act, in its own capacity, would encourage people to commit smaller sins and doing so is considered offensive. Viewpoint of Ash'arites Al-Ash'ari the great theologian and the founder of the Ash'ari school of thought believes that a servant doesn't hold any claim in the presence of God. Reward is something that God graces the servant with; that is to say, He grants something to him which he did not deserve. Obedience to God simply lays the foundation for God's grace. In the case of punishment too, the same idea is applied. In other words, a factor like disobedience or sin doesn't ever merit punishment. It is because God caused him to go astray and deprived him, that he became a disbeliever. Al-Ash'ari went so further on to say that if God forgave all the disbelievers and made them enter heaven, such an act is apt because of his mercy and cannot be criticized and is not incompatible with His wisdom. Al-Ash'ari discredited ihbat because God knew from the very beginning that a certain person is worth rewarding so He does not cancel out his reward due to his commission of sin. Similarly, for a person whom God knows to be worth punishing, He does not forego his punishment due to any act of obedience by him. A sinner and a good-doer will receive just exactly that much punishment and reward that God had prescribed for them from the beginning. Viewpoint of Imamiyya Amongst the Imamiyya school of thought, only the Nawbakhtis accept the I'itizalite view on ihbat whereas the other theologians reject that view. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi To refute the concept of ihbat, al-Shaykh al-Tusi states that there is no conflict between obedience and sin, and reward and punishment that both of these should have an effect on the other. Conflict exists only between two contradicting things, and there is not a contradiction between obedience and sin because both of these are from the same category. In other words, the same act that appears in the form of obedience can also emerge in the form of a sin, For example, sitting in somebody's house in a way of usurpation is a sin whereas a regular sitting without such an intention is not, and both of these are of the same category. Similarly, there is not a conflict in retribution, because reward and punishment also are from the same category. Even if we assume that there is a contradiction between these two, a conflict would never arise between them because both of these are non-existent, and a true contradiction in the state of non-existence cannot be in conflict with its contradicting party. For example, non-existent darkness and light do not have any interaction between them therefore they cannot contradict each other. On the other hand, according to al-Shaykh al-Tusi, the belief that \"If somebody has done good and evil deeds and this makes him deserve praise as well as admonition, he is treated as somebody who has neither done any good nor evil\" does not intellectually make sense. Similarly, believing in something like, \"If somebody's evil deeds exceed his good ones, he should be considered as one who has not performed any good deeds at all, or vice versa, if somebody's good deeds exceed his bad ones, he should be treated as one who has not committed any bad deeds\" doesn't stand the test of reason. Ibn Maytham Bahrani Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (d. 699 /1299-1300) is another theologian from the Imamiyyah school of thought who refuted ihbat using philosophical methods. He stated that the survival of a complete or perfect cause necessitates the survival of its effect. Faith preceding a sin is the complete cause that deserves reward. Keeping in mind that this faith is present even after committing a sin, hence, it necessitates the existence of its effect i.e. his deserving reward.

{"title": "Shafa'a", "text": " Shafāʿa (Arabic: الشفاعة , intercession) is a religious act, all Muslims and followers of divine religions believe in. Shafa'a means that on the Day of Judgment , friends of God and some holy entities such as the Qur'an , with some conditions, intercede for some wrong-doers and rescue them from hellfire or cause the promotion of some people. According to Shiite beliefs, Shafa'a completely belongs to God and nobody can intercede without His permission. If God is satisfied with one's faith , He will permit others to intercede for one. Shafa'a has been explicitly mentioned in Sunni sources stipulating the intercession of the Prophet (s) for believers. Among Muslims, Wahhabis believe that only God can be asked for Shafa'a and if someone asks others for Shafa'a (especially after their demise), he is a polytheist . Belief in Shafa'a has a special position among Shi'a . Definition The word of Shafa'a is derived from the root of \" ش ف ع \" meaning \"to append or join something to another\". Shafi' (intercessor) is called so because they join one to themselves and provide one with what one lacks and thus rescue one. Shafa'a in religious terminology means \"a creature's mediation between God and another creature in delivering the good or driving away the evil whether in this world or in the hereafter.\" Shafa'a means to make a change in the sinner so that the sinner no longer deserves to be punished and exclude one from the law of punishment; like repentance makes a wrongdoer no longer deserve the punishment and makes one deserve receiving God's forgiveness, as Imam 'Ali (a) has said: \"There is no Shafi' (intercessor) more rescuing than repentance.\" Shafi' (intercessor) is called so because this person tries to adjoin someone else to himself and recompense the person's sins. Shafa'a has a close relation with Tawassul (entreaty): Tawassul is the act of one who takes refuge to a person and asks for intercession and thus Shafa'a is the act of the person asking God to forgive that wrongdoer. The belief in Shafa'a also exists in other divine religions such as Judaism and Christianity . In the Qur'an Shafa'a has been clearly stated in the Qur'an in 24 verses many of which negates the pagans' belief in the intercession of idols. \"They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you inform Allah about something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?’ Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]!\" ( Qur'an 10 :18) Although the Qur'an denies the intercession of the idols, it has acknowledged the intercession of some figures such as the Prophet (s) with some conditions. Therefore, Muslims have no disagreement on the principle of Shafa'a in general and disagree only on its rulings and position. For example, in the verse \"And keep vigil for a part of the night, as a supererogatory [devotion] for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to a praiseworthy station.\" ( Qur'an 17 :79) Shi'a and Sunni exegetes agree that by \"a praiseworthy station\", the position of Shafa'a is meant which God has promised to His Messenger (s). The verses mentioned in the Qur'an about Shafa'a can be categorized in some groups, Some of them totally reject Shafa'a in the hereafter, [5] Some regard Shafa'a exclusive to God, [6] Some regard Shafa'a conditioned to the permission and order of God, [7] Some reject Shafa'a about some people. Studying all the verses of Shafa'a, it can be inferred that the Qur'an approves of a kind of Shafa'a and disapproves and rejects other kinds of Shafa'a. The verses which reject Shafa'a imply that no one other than God has such a right and those verses which support Shafa'a imply that Shafa'a belongs to God and others can do Shafa'a only by His permission. “ Intercession is of no avail with Him except for those whom He permits. ” — Quran, 34:23 In Hadiths In hadiths narrated from the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the truth of Shafa'a has clearly been approved and explained. The Prophet (s) stated, \" God blessed me with five privileges… one of which is [the right to make] Shafa'a and I have secured it for my people. Shafa'a will be for those who do not commit polytheism .\" [8] The Prophet (s) also said, \"three groups make Shafa'a for sinners before God and their Shafa'a will be accepted: Prophets (a) , scholars of religion, and the martyrs .\" [9] The hadiths of Shafa'a are in three groups: Hadiths which say that Shafa'a will make a sinner be forgiven from going to the hell . Hadiths which say that some sinners after a while staying in the hell will enjoy Shafa'a and rescued from punishment . Hadiths which say that some people will never enjoy Shafa'a and will eternally remain in hell. Therefore, those hadiths which say that anyone having a particle of faith will enjoy Shafa'a do not disagree those hadiths which say one who does some very wrong acts such as he takes the prayer of little importance will not enjoy Shafa'a, because anyone who believes in God will once enjoy Shafa'a but he will be long left in hell so that some of his impurities will be cleansed and deserve Shafa'a. In the View of Intellect From the point of hadiths, validity of Shafa'a is definite and its rulings are clear; however, Muslim thinkers have mentioned rational justifications as well. Morteza Motahhari wrote, \"Even if there was no traditional justification for Shafa'a, we had to justify it using intellect and rational arguments such as the argument of Imkan Ashraf (the Possibility of the Superior) and the nature of organizational creation. When a person accepts the existence of God 's forgiveness, definite rational principles make him say that forgiveness needs to flow through a total intellect or soul, i.e. the intellect and soul of one who has the position of total divine Wilaya ; and it is not possible that God's mercy reaches creation without order.\" From intellectual point of view, Shafa'a is flowing in the creation and is the requirement of the system of causality . Rational justification is based on two criteria: The general mercy of God : God's mercy is general and reaches all creatures. And if a creature receives a smaller proportion of divine mercy, it would only be due to his own incompetence. Basically, no creature can ever reach happiness and success alone without divine mercy or rescues punishment. Organizational nature of world: from rational viewpoint, the world has an organization and hierarchy. This system of hierarchy is the very same system of causality. Material needs of human beings are fulfilled through a chain of natural causes which all effect by the permission of God. [11] Even though mercy and forgiveness of God is general but it is not excluded from this law and they are impossible to reach the creation without means and this is true about all kinds of divine mercy. For example, revelation which is an instance of God's guidance and mercy is not received by all human beings, but only certain people receive it and other people benefit from it through these people; because no one other than prophets (a) has such a competence to be directly addressed by God. And this is that very hierarchical system of creation. Or for another example, when Istisqa prayer (prayer requesting rain) is made, it is not that it rains without any change in the weather; but due to the Istisqa prayer, God provides all the causes and means of raining including the wind and condensation of clouds. The same way as the Istisqa prayer causes that the requirements for raining are provided, Shafa'a, repentance , and such cause a change in the states of the sinner so that he acquires the competence for forgiveness, decrease of punishment or promotion. The position of Shafa'a in this system is that it promotes a person's competence so that he can more benefit from God's general mercy. It is due to this rationality that if a one lacks perfection, it needs to acquire that perfection from a source of perfection and if it does not have the competence to receive perfection, it needs to develop its competence to necessary level. Such an action not only breaks no rule but it is in fact what rationality requires. Therefore, Shafa'a about a person does not imply that while he is incompetent and lacks the requirements, making Shafa'a will be accepted about him; also, Shafa'a in legislation does not mean to cancel the law and not applying the law about that wrongdoer who is deserved to be punished; rather, Shafa'a means to make such a change in that person so that he would not deserve punishment anymore and he will be excluded from that law of punishment, the same way repentance rescues a person from punishment and makes him deserved of God's forgiveness. Therefore, it is mentioned in hadiths that Shafa'a is the best of Shafi' (intercessor). In other words, the essential difference between the true Shafa'a with a false one is that true Shafa'a initiates from God and ends with the sinner and intercessor is only the means of delivering God's mercy to lower levels; however, in false Shafa'a, like favoring someone, the wrongdoer without having the required competence and only through relation requests for something. Types In Creation and Legislation Shafa'a in creation means that the origin of any action or effect is God and all other causes and means are only means through which God's mercy is delivered to lower levels by His permission. This way, all the causes in the world are intercessors of their effects since they deliver God's mercy to lower levels. For example, the sun is the intercessor of the wheat grain to make it grow. In the Qur'an we read, “ To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that may intercede with Him except with His permission? ” — Qur'an, 2:255 Shafa'a in legislation means that God, out of His mercy, has sent laws for people which guide them and in fact intercede them to enter the paradise . All religious rulings are of this type. False Intercession False Shafa'a is that the wrongdoer acts against the law and influences the will of the lawmaker through an illegal way. Such kind of Shafa'a in this world is an act of oppression and it is impossible in the hereafter . The objections to Shafa'a are mostly of this kind and this is rejected in the Qur'an as well. The false Shafa'a originates from the belief in Tafwid (unrestricted human delegation) which is a wrong belief meaning that after creating the world, God delegated its management to others and He has no role in it and thus people would be able to make Shafa'a independently and if one can attract the intercessors' favor, he would not need God. True Intercession True Shafa'a as mentioned in the Qur'an which is believed by Shi'a and supported by Imams (a) is that Shafa'a in its wholeness belongs to God and no one can make Shafa'a without His permission. Prophets (a) and Imams' (a) Shafa'a never means that they have an independent role or that to be privileged by their Shafa'a, one would need to do anything other than what God has ordered. On the contrary, they would only make Shafa'a for someone, God would be pleased with, “ …and they do not intercede except for someone He approves of,… ” — 21:28, Qur'an For Forgiveness and for Propmotion Sometimes, Shafa'a is for promotion which is accepted by all Islamic schools and sometimes, it is for forgiveness of the sins which some schools such as Mu'tazilites and Kharijites reject. These two schools do not accept that Shafa'a would be made about those who commit capital sins and those who have entered the hell. They say that, \"one who has entered the hell would not exit it.\" Sometimes, Shafa'a is about issues in the hereafter, such as the Shafa'a of the Prophet (s) for the sinners on the Day of Judgment and it is sometimes about issues of this world. If some actions are good, Shafa'a for them is also good, and if it is about sins, it is not only bad but also the intercessor needs to take the responsibility for a part of it. Requirements Due to the educational purpose and avoiding people from being bold in committing sins, the Qur'an and hadiths have not mentioned all the details and requirements for one to be interceded for; however, they have mentioned some necessary requirements. The most important requirement for one to be interceded for is that God approves of him. From the verse of the Qur'an, two requirements can be understood for those who are going to be interceded for: To have taken a covenant with God [18] To be witness to the truth [19] It is obvious that one who needs Shafa'a of forgiveness because of some sins, God does not approve his act; rather, it means that God approves of that person's religion and beliefs. In other words, the one who is going to be interceded for even if is a sinner and has committed greater sins, he must have not cut his relation with God and leaders of religion. Obstacles of Shafa'a From the Qur'an, it can be understood that some issues are obstacles for benefiting from Shafa'a. Some groups who are deprived of Shafa'a are as follows: Disbelievers and polytheists Traitors Hypocrites Oppressors Enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) (Nasibis) Deniers of the Wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) and other Imams (a) Those who harassed the progeny and children of the Prophet (s) Deniers of Shafa'a Those who do not take prayer seriously Those who abandon prayer Intercessors Shafa'a in creation as the influence of causes exists in whole creation. Therefore, in hadiths, the right to make Shafa'a is also mentioned for some places as well as for people and groups and it refers to the effect of such issues in the guidance of people. In Shafa'a of legislation, intercessors are either among the righteous acts of a person, prophets (s), friends of God or other issues. God the Almighty: Since God is All-merciful, after that intercessors make Shafa'a for people on the Day of Judgment, many people who will be deprived of all intercessors' Shafa'a will receive God's Sahfa'a and mercy. [21] The Prophet (s) : the Prophet's (s) Shafa'a is called Shafa'a al-Kubra (great intercession). In different hadiths, it is mentioned that his Shafa'a will include those believers who have committed greater sins . Imam 'Ali (a) Lady Fatima (a) Imams (a) The Qur'an Prophets (a) and friends of God . [22] Angels [23] Repentance : The superiority of the intercession of the prophets (a) and angels over repentance is that their Shafa'a is effective also on the Day of Judgment ; while, repentance is only for this world. Religious scholars [24] Martyrs Effects The nature of Shafa'a is neither encouraging to sin , nor a green light for sinners. It is not a cause of staying behind or mediation either; rather, it is an important educational issue which has constructive effects, some of which are mentioned below: Raising hope: Usually, the power of the self and lowly desires leads to committing great sins and following it, a spirit of disappointment takes over the person and this disappointment leads the person to more corruption. On the contrary, being hopeful in Sahfa'a of the friends of God, as a preventive factor, gives people hope that if they correct themselves, their bad past could be compensated through Shafa'a of the righteous and the pure. Establishing spiritual connection with friends of God: Obviously, someone who hopes in Shafa'a, tries to establish such a relation and does something which pleases them and does not break his cord of love with them, which can lead to doing more good deeds. Trying to Acquire the Prerequisites of Sahafa'a: The hopeful in Shafa'a need to review their deeds in the past and make better decisions about the future for Sahfa'a would not happen without proper background; and that is because Shafa'a is a kind of bestowing mercy which actualizes due to the proper background of the one who is interceded for and also because of the honor, dignity and righteous deeds of the intercessor. [25] Wahhabis and Shafa'a All Sunnis including Wahhabis believe in Shafa'a. The leader of Wahhabis, Ibn Taymiyya said, \"Hadiths about Shafa'a are many and frequently narrated in Sahih Muslim and Sahih al-Bukhari and many of them also exist in Sunan and Masanid.\" Elsewhere he said, \"The Prophet (s) will have three kinds of Shafa'a on the Day of Judgment … The third type of Shafa'a is for those who deserve the hellfire. Shafa'a of the Prophet (s), other prophets (a), the righteous and others is so that a person who deserves the hellfire, will not enter it and it is also for the one who has entered the hellfire (to be rescued).\" They believe in the request of Shafa'a from prophets (a) and the righteous in this world during the lifetime of the intercessors and also on the Day of Judgment. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Hasan b. Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1285/1869) said, \"Asking for Shafa'a from the Prophet (s) during his lifetime is because of his du'a and his du'a is accepted, but after his demise, asking Shafa'a from him is impermissible.\" The disagreement between Wahhabis and other Muslims is over requesting Shafa'a from prophets (a) and friends of God during Barzakh (the Middle World), about which, since Wahhabis do not believe in the life in Barzakh, they regard this kind of Shafa'a impermissible and even consider it an example of polytheism . 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab said, \"We approve of Shafa'a for our prophet (s) on the Day of Judgment according to hadiths. We also approve of it for other prophets (a), angels, friends of God and children due to the reports we have received, but we seek Shafa'a from its owner (God)… Shafa'a needs to be requested from God not intercessors, e.g. one should not say, \"O the Messenger of God! O the friend of God! I ask you Shafa'a or its means. … or similar expressions, which no one other than God has the power upon them. Request for Shafa'a from the intercessors while they are in Barzakh is a kind of polytheism.\" Criticisms of Wahhabis The most important criticisms mentioned by Wahhabis are: Polytheism Asking Shafa'a from the intercessor means to call anyone other than God and this is polytheism in worshiping, because God says, “ \"so do not invoke anyone along with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 72:18 Answer The above criticism comes from Wahhabis' misunderstanding of the meaning of unity of God and polytheism. The true understanding of polytheism and unity of God implies that invoking anyone other than God does not mean polytheism in itself and it is not even forbidden since polytheism refers to cases in which one believes an independent divinity and lordship other than God and Shi'a never believe as such neither about their Imams (a) nor any other beings but for Allah alone. Undoubtedly, invoking Muslims and requesting them for help is a permissible action and they need to help such an invoker as much as they can. On the other hand, when an action is permissible for a person, asking him to do that is permissible as well. When Shafa'a would be permissible for the Prophet (s) and other intercessors, asking Shafa'a from them would also be permissible. Asking people for making du'a for one is permissible in the view of all Muslims such as that we ask someone, \"make du'a for me\"; therefore, asking Shafa'a from a person who has permission for that from God , such as he is asked, \"make Shafa'a for me before God\" is also permissible. To forgive sins, God invites people to ask the Prophet (s) to make du'a for their forgiveness, “ \"Had they, when they wronged themselves, come to you and pleaded to Allah for forgiveness, and the Apostle had pleaded for forgiveness for them, they would have surely found Allah all-clement, all-merciful.\" ” — Qur'an, 4:64 Some tried to explain the meaning of this verse so that, people who have harassed the Prophet (s) needed to ask him for forgiveness; but through a more careful look into the verse, wrongness of this interpretation can be understood so that, if the Prophet (s) was about to forgive people's sin about his own rights, the verse needed to say \"and the Apostle had forgave them\" while the verse says, \"the Apostle had pleaded for them\". Moreover, the above mentioned verse Wahhabis refer to ( Qur'an 72 :18) prohibits Muslims from partnership and association, i.e. that Muslims do not consider anyone at similar level with God. The verse actually addresses polytheists who regarded the means independently. Also, if asking anyone other than God is a polytheistic act, there would be no difference between the life and after death of people and thus no one should ever ask the Prophet (s) or another even during their lifetimes. In authentic Sunni hadiths, it is mentioned that al-Tirmidhi quoted from Anas b. Malik that he asked the Prophet (s) to make Shafa'a for him on the Day of Judgment . He is quoted as saying, \"I asked the Prophet (s) to make Shafa'a for me on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet (s) said, 'I will.' I said, 'where should I look for you then?' He (s) said, 'first near al-Sirat Bridge .'\" Excluding Shafa'a to God The Qur'an considers the right to make Shafa'a exclusive to God, “ \"Say, All intercession rests with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 39:44 Therefore, Shafa'a need to be requested from God alone. Answer Shafa'a from this aspect that it is a kind of making influence in the creation, is among the manifestations of God's Lordship and thus it belongs to Him; however, this does not contradict with believing in the rights of Shafa'a for prophets (a) and the righteous; because, their Shafa'a is not independent but depending on the permission of God while it is the same in other issues. In the Qur'an God says, “ …that power, altogether, belongs to Allah… ” — 2:165, Qur'an which means that all the powers in the world belongs to God and all the creatures gain power by His permission and will and to the extent that He wishes and after God gives a being power, then that being can be asked for help. Also, the verse “ \"Say, 'All intercession rests with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 39:44 means that if God sees it appropriate and gives the right to make Shafa'a to a being, then that being can be requested to use the permission God has given him for the one requesting. Resembling Polytheists In the Qur'an, God considers the polytheists of the time of the Prophet (s) polytheist because they ask Shafa'a from other than God, “ They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.' ” — Qur'an, 10:18 Answer There is no doubt that polytheists of the time of the Prophet (s) considered the rights to ask their idols and gods for Shafa'a, but this verse implies that they worshiped idols and also considered the rights of Shafa'a for them and thus believing in their Shafa'a together with worshiping them led to their criticism. Polytheists considered unconditional rights of Shafa'a for their idols which God never had given them such position. Also, they believed in their divinity and worshiped them; while if one believes in someone's rights of Shafa'a God has given him and that using such rights is by the permission of God, then there would be no problem. On the other hand, no Muslim considers the position of divinity for intercessors to worship them so that his act resembles the acts of the polytheists. It is obvious that only showing respect and kissing Darih in holy shrines without believing in divinity would not be considered as worship; for if it was considered so, then respecting and kissing the hands of parents would also be considered as worshiping them. Another point is that idols made of stone and wood had no permission to harm or benefit and it was only the claim of idol-worshipers who believed in the effects of those stone and wood and their beliefs are different from the effects believed to exist in the Shafa'a of the intercessors by the permission of God. In the above mentioned verse, God addresses the idol-worshipers that, \"you believe in positions for idols I have not given to them. Do you want to give news to God about what (idols' effects) He does not have news about?\" and this is different with asking the friends of God for Shafa'a. This verse has not mentioned anything about asking for Shafa'a; rather it addresses believing in the Shafa'a of idols, \"they say, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.'\" and it has not said, \"they say, make intercession for us before Allah.'\" Therefore, if Wahhabi's reasoning is right, then believing in Shafa'a would be totally polytheistic and this includes Wahhabis as well, because they believe in Shafa'a in general. Hadith Rejecting the Request for Shafa'a from People It is narrated from Imam 'Ali (a) in Nahj al-Balagha saying, \"Know that He Who owns the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth has permitted you to pray to Him and has promised you acceptance of the prayer. He has commanded you to beg from Him in order that He may give you and to seek His mercy in order that He may have mercy on you. He has not placed anything between you and Him that may veil Him from you. He has not required you to get a mediator for you to Him, and if you err, He has not prevented you from repentance.\" Answer Firstly, Shafa'a is among the issues which all of Muslims, even Wahhabis , have accepted and it is mentioned the Qur'an and hadiths . Secondly, by the sentence \"He has not required you to get a mediator for you to Him\", Imam 'Ali (a) meant that God's mercy upon people is not like people's so that when they do not know some people, they refer to some people to introduce them to those people so that they can reach their wishes; because God is the Knower of secrets and the Unseen and knows all humans and their requests directly; but He refers people to the means due to His wisdom and because the causal system in the world of nature and spirituality requires. God Almighty has not made human distressed so that he needs to refer to a mediator or an intercessor; because the need for a mediator is when there is no access to the main person either due to his meanness or ignorance about the rights of the one who requests; while God has no meanness or restriction of access contrary to the opinions of the Christians and polytheists who believe that there needs to be means between God and human beings. Request from Those who have Passed away Wahhabis say that asking Shafa'a from intercessors after their demise is impermissible since it is a polytheistic act and the dead cannot hear the living. Answer If some action are polytheistic, it would be polytheistic both in this world and the hereafter and there would be no difference. Moreover, death is about body, while soul is living and hearing du'as and Shafa'a and answering it is related with the soul not the body. There are many Sunni hadiths about reciting Salawat upon the Prophet (s) and saying Salam (salutation) to him from far or near and it is clarified that the Prophet (s) hears these Salams and praises and answers to them. We Have No Rights to Ask Them Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab says, \"If one says that, 'the Prophet (s) is given the rights to make Shafa'a and I ask him about what God has given to him'; the answer would be that God has given him the rights to make Shafa'a, but He has prohibited you from asking him and has said that, 'so do not invoke anyone along with Allah . (72:18)'\" Answer Firstly, the above verse has no relation with asking for Shafa'a; and it is about the polytheists who considered independent partners for God and asked them their requests and thus such verses cannot be identified with believers. Secondly, as it is mentioned above, the meaning of this verse and other such verses which have come with \" مع \" [with] is that no being should ever be considered at the same level with God, but if one believes that God has given permission to a means or mediator to do something while he considers anything done by the order of God; this would not be an act of polytheism, and it is along with monotheism, the same as when in the Qur'an , Prophet Jesus (a) attributes healing the sick, reviving the dead, and even creating a bird from mud to himself but depending on the permission of God. Deniers of Shafa'a Those who have basically denied Shafa'a have mentioned some reasons: Boldness over Sinning Some believe that believing in Shafa'a causes boldness over sinning in people and revives the spirit of transgression in sinners and criminals; thus, believing in it is not compatible with the spirit of the Islamic law and other laws. Answer Firstly, if it is so, repentance which brings the forgiveness of sins can be considered as encouraging people to sin again; while, repentance is an original Islamic belief and agreed by all Muslims. Secondly, Shafa'a would lead to transgression only if includes all criminals in general; but, if it becomes ambiguous that for what sins and sinners and when on the Day of Judgment , Sahfa'a would be used, then it would not lead to encouragement of sinning. There is No Need for a Mediator God is closer to human beings than their veins and more merciful than anyone to His creation, thus why would we go to anyone other than Him for any request. Answer It is true that God is closer to us than our vein, but the wisdom of creation of human being on earth has required that God sends His messengers to guide people than speaking directly to them and that wisdom also required that the position of these messengers would be high before people so that the guidance would be accomplished in a better way, therefore God granted them infallibility from sinning and error, so that human being would follow them confidently and gave them positions in appearance so that their great positions before God is better known to people and attracted people's hearts to them. In the Qur'an, God mentions some cases and tells people to take these people as mediator in order to reach better results, cases such as the brothers of Prophet Joseph (a) who asked their father to intercede for them and ask God for their forgiveness , or elsewhere introduced the Last Prophet's (s) asking for forgiveness more effective than people's own supplication or mentioned that people referred to prophet Jesus (s) as the divine proof of their time to heal their sick ones and solve their problems. If it was wrong to take a mediator while knowing the closeness of God, it must have been criticized in the Qur'an, not introducing it to people as a recommended act. Justice or Oppression Shafa'a removes the punishment, which is either justice or oppression. If it is justice, then punishment has been God's oppression (God forbids), and if it's not and punishment is justice, then Sahfa'a of intercessors and their action in removing the punishment is oppression. Answer Removing the punishment can be mercy and neither labels of justice or punishment applies about it. In other words, removing punishment is mercy and above justice. God, the Immaculate has determined punishment for wrongdoers according to His justice, but removing punishment due to Shafa'a is mercy and kindness. God has taught His servants to be just and ordered them to try to reach the level higher than justice which is kindness, “ \"Indeed Allah enjoins justice and kindness,…\" ” — Qur'an, 19:90 He also taught His servants that if one did wrong about you, you can punish one due to justice, however it would be better if you forgive one due to patience and kindness.

{"title": "Tabarruk", "text": " Tabarruk (Arabic: التَبَرُّک , to bless) is the religious practice of asking for blessing and a request for favor and grace from God and holy beings. The subject of tabarruk can be human beings such as prophets (a) and Imams (a) or things such as the Qur'an or places such as Ka'ba . In addition to having references in the Qur'an, hadiths and the conduct of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a), tabarruk is justifiable and valid according to theological and psychological principles. According to verses of the Qur'an, tabarruk has been practiced by other prophets (a) as well. Admissibility and legitimacy of tabarruk is accepted by all Islamic sects and only Wahhabis rejecte its admissibility and consider it an example of polytheism . Definition Terminology In the terminology of religious texts, tabarruk means seeking divine blessing and grace from a person or thing God has given privilege; whether a worldly blessing such as the increase of income or a blessing for the hereafter such as the spiritual promotion. Through seeking tabarruk, one tries to benefit from divine grace and power out of blessings. Blessings are divine gifts bestowed upon people, nature and things and consists of worldly or spiritual benefits which origin from divine mercy . This way, it can be interpreted as a transfer of a holy and efficient power emanated from the supernatural world and gives the receiver a new quality. Some scholars believe that in the process of blessing, a favorable effect from a holy and exalted being granted upon non-holy beings and accompanies an emanation of the holiness in a merciful manner. In this process, three things happen: Establishment of connection with the supernatural world Transfer of the holy power to another being or thing Existential promotion of the blessed being or thing [3] Connection through Tawassul [Entreaty] Tabarruk and tawassul have many points of similarity regarding their concepts and features, especially in those cases when through tabarruk people seek to achieve a spiritual blessing. Some scholars believe that since the reality of tabarruk is tawassul, there is no difference between them. However, these two concepts have differences in that tawassul is to ask religious nobilities to ask God for something and tabarruk is asking for a worldly or spiritual blessing which God has trusted some people or things with. In the Qur'an and Hadiths The word \"tabarruk\" is not used in the Qur'an , but other derivatives from its root are mentioned 34 times including the words, \"barak-a\", \"barakna\", \"burik-a\", \"tabarak-a\", \"barakat\", \"barakatuh\", \"mubarak\", \"mubarak-an\", and \"mubaraka\". In the Qur'an, The word \"Mubarak\" [blessed] is used to describe certain people, beings, places, and times. Blessed Beings Prophet Noah (a) and his companions, \"It was said, 'O Noah! Disembark in peace from Us and with [Our] blessings upon you and upon nations [to descend] from those who are with you, and nations whom We shall provide for, then a painful punishment from Us shall befall them.'\" [5] Prophets Abraham (a) and Isaac (a) , \"And We blessed him and Isaac.\" [6] Prophet Moses (a) and Angels , \"So when he came to it, he was called: 'Blessed is He who is in the fire and who is [as well] around it, …\" [7] Prophet Jesus (a) , \"He has made me blessed, wherever I may be,\" [8] Family of Abraham (a), \"…[That is] Allah's mercy and His blessings upon you, members of the household.\" [9] The Glorious Qur'an , \"And this Book that We have sent down is a blessed one….\" [10] Rain Water, \"And We send down from the sky salubrious water, …\" [11] Olive Tree, \"… from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western,…\" [12] Blessed Places Ka'ba [13] and al-Masjid al-Haram , \"Indeed the first house to be set up for mankind is the one at Bakkah blessed...\" [14] Al-Masjid al-Nabawi [15] Medina [16] The holy land of Tur, \"When he (Moses) approached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley at the blessed spot …\" [17] Palestine [18] Al-Aqsa Mosque and around it, \"Al-Aqsa Mosque whose environs We have blessed, …\" [19] Egypt [20] and Syria [21] [Levant], \"We made the people who were abased the heirs to the east and west of the land which We had blessed, …\" [22] Yemen [23] Lands between Euphrates , Palestine to al-Arish region of Egypt. This area is blessed with material blessings [24] as well as being spiritually blessed by being the origin of most prophets, spread of religions and Divine Books, [25] residence of prophets [26] and graves of prophets such as prophets Abraham (a) , Isaac (a) , Jacob (a) and righteous people. [27] In the Bible A historical background of tabarruk is given in religious scriptures: In the Old Testament, tabarruk is mentioned in what happened to Prophets Jacob (a) and Joseph (a) . By reciting prayer on their food, Jews bless it and then they have it. In the gospel of Mark, Jesus (a) is considered blessed. In the gospel of Barnabas, it is mentioned that creatures were blessed by the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Early Jews had a custom to bless themselves by applying a blessed ointment to their bodies It is said that the reason for calling Jesus as Christ was because he was blessed by the mentioned blessed ointment. Permissibility of Tabarruk According to common opinion of Muslims , from ideological and theological perspective, visiting the graves of the friends of God and seeking blessings from what is attributed to them has been a good act. Divine blessings and forgiveness bestows upon people through some means including prophets and friends of God. In this process, the means are assigned by God and the origin of blessings is God Himself and means from which Muslims seek blessing do not have any position independent from God and thus seeking tabarruk from them does not signify polytheism . Shi'a Authorities In the views of Shi'a authorities , seeking blessings from what is holy and pure in Islam is permissible and even recommended. In their view, seeking tabarruk from the names of Imams (a) by writing them on the shroud, naming children after their names, seeking tabarruk from holy shrines and the soil of the graves of the infallible (a) for example by putting it in the grave, seeking tabarruk from the Qur'an by writing it on the shroud and touching its words and letters are recommended. Shi'a bring evidence for permissibility of seeking tabarruk from the Qur'an and the conduct of the Prophet (s) and Muslims. Moreover, the principle of ibaha [primary intellectual judgment] and the permission for cases for which seeking tabarruk is questionable or are not definitely admissible can solve the issue of permissibility. Sunni Authorities Sunni authorities and scholars have disagreements over recommendation or kiraha of seeking tabarruk from the Prophet's (a) grave. However, according to their wordings, their opinion suggesting dislike seems to be out of fear for approaching the grave and touching the body to it for observing manner before God. Hanbalis and Hanafis Ahmad b. Hanbal regards it permissible to seek tabarruk from the pulpit and the grave of the Prophet (s) and kissing them. Also, Shihab al-Din al-Khafaji who is one of the Hanafi scholars considers it permissible to touch and kiss the grave of the Prophet (s), however regard it disliked (makruh). Shafi'is Some Shafi'i scholars such as al-Ramli al-Shafi'i consider it permissible to touch the graves of the Prophet (s), friends of God and Islamic scholars and also kissing the entrance gates to graves of the friends of God with the intention of seeking tabarruk. Also Muhib al-Din al-Tabari considered it permissible to touch the grave and kiss it and regarded it in agreement with the conduct of the scholars and righteous people. Malikis Al-Zarqani al-Maliki believes that there is no problem in kissing the grave of the Prophet (s) with the intention of seeking tabarruk. Wahhabis Wahhabis do not consider it permissible to seek tabarruk of any kind. Accordingly, they have issued some opinions and reasons as following: First Opinion Some of them say that although at the time of the Prophet (s) , Companions used to seek tabarruk from the Prophet (s) and thus it was permissible at that time, but after he (a) passed away, seeking tabarruk from him would only be possible through what has touched his body. These people have mentioned two reasons to justify their opinion: Tabarruk signifies polytheism and is similar to the acts of idol-worshippers and an example of polytheism. On the other hand, there is no support for its admissibility in the tradition. [44] This kind of tabarruk is making bid'a : because tabarruk is an act of worship and it is a rule that acts of worship are exclusiveness; therefore, naming an act as an act of worship, without having any background in the conduct of the companions of the Prophet (s) is regarded as bid'a [unauthentic new practice] and bid'a is haram . [45] Therefore, touching and seeking tabarruk from the doors and walls of al-Masjid al-Nabawi , [46] al-Masjid al-Haram , the two rukns of Ka'ba , Hajar al-Aswad , walls of Ka'ba, and Maqam Ibrahim (a) (Abraham's (a) Station), the Rock in Jerusalem , and the graves of prophets and righteous people. [47] Second Opinion Some others believe that seeking tabarruk has only been permissible about the Prophet (s) and only when he (s) was alive and thus after he (s) passed away, seeking tabarruk is not permissible even to parts of his body whatever belonged to him. These people say that companions ' seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) has been because God assigned him as the Wali (guardian) over believers and since his guardianship is limited to when he was alive and after he (s) passed away, there was no guardianship then seeking tabarruk is not allowed anymore. Third Opinion Some others believe that seeking tabarruk has only been permissible from the Prophet (s) and God has only bestowed blessings in the Prophet's (a) body, then seeking tabarruk from people other than him is not permissible at all. These people say that Sahaba and Tabi'un avoided seeking tabarruk from anyone or anything other than the Prophet (s) and his belongings, since they wanted to avoid involving in polytheism or exaggeration . Criticism and Analysis of Wahhabis' Opinion Discussing the First Opinion Analyzing the first reason: there are several weak points and problems about considering tabarruk as an act of polytheism. Acts of worship are practices performed intended to worship God; but, when a person seeks tabarruk from what belongs to great people in religion , he never means to consider a divine position for them and has no intention of worship in seeking tabarruk; therefore, his act is not an act of worship to have disagreement with monotheism in worship or to be exaggerating . The proof for this claim is that it was practiced several times before the Prophet (s) and he neither prohibited that, nor called it polytheistic, while he did prohibit anyone who said something exaggerating or polytheistic. Revering prophets and friends of God and what belongs to them is an example of venerating signs of the Divine and has been admired by the Qur'an and the companions' prudence in cases of seeking tabarruk shows that they also wanted to revere that person as well; cases such as putting the soil of the Prophet's (a) grave on the eye or his hair by Ahmad b. Hanbal and also al-Shafi'i 's prohibition of people riding horses on the ground of Medina which is where the Prophet (s) walked, proves the mentioned claim. Not only there is no prohibition ever mentioned for venerating graves of the Prophet (s) and friends of God, even there are some permissions mentioned for it. Ahmad b. Hanbal's fatwa [52] which Ibn Taymiyya has also been aware of [53] and the conduct of great Shi'a and Sunni scholars in permitting veneration of the Prophet's (a) grave, al-Rawdat al-Nabawi and his pulpit and seeking tabarruk form them proves the wrongness of any prohibition in that regard. Also, wills of the First and Second Caliphs for burying them beside the Prophet's (a) grave [54] has only been out of seeking tabarruk from his grave [55] and this is another reason for permissibility of seeking tabarruk from the Prophet's (s) grave. There have been issued some problems considering tabarruk as Bid'a for which the following answers are given: With several reasons mentioned for permissibility of this act, it cannot be considered as signifying an act of Bid'a. If this act or any certain type of it is considered a new act which has no history at the time of the Prophet (s), still not any new act is bad and forbidden while bid'a is actually a new act which is introduced in religion and we have no reason for its legitimacy. On the contrary, tabarruk cannot be considered bid'a since there are several reasons and evidences for the conduct of Muslims to support it; and even according to al-Shafi'i, it is a recommended practice. Also, in those cases for which there is no clearly mentioned permission for it, the principle of Ibaha can be referred to according to which whatever action for which we have no reason for its prohibition is permissible and legitimate. Discussing the Second Opinion It is not right since: The Prophet (s) has been living in barzakh (the world after this world and before the hereafter ) [56] and thus his Wilaya (guardianship) is not limited to his life in this world and has continued after his life in this world. [57] Historical evidences show that seeking tabarruk has always been practiced by his companions and the followers after he (s) passed on. [58] Discussing the Third Opinion This opinion is not right either since: Seeking tabarruk has not been practiced only about the Prophet (s) and it is permissible to be practiced about righteous people as well; some cases of which practiced about companions and followers will be mentioned later. That the Prophet (s) or his companions did not do an action, it is not a reason for prohibition of that. Reasons and Evidences for Permissibility of Tabarruk In Qur'an The Glorious Qur'an has referred to tabarruk in some verses and has not mentioned it either prohibited or permissible. Moreover, some these cases are practiced either by prophets themselves or at their presence which clearly shows its permissibility. Prophet Jacob (a) sought tabarruk from Joseph's (a) shirt which is mentioned in the Qur'an. When Joseph (a) told his brothers to put his shirt on the eyes of their father, \"Take this shirt of mine, and cast it upon my father's face; he will regain his sight…\" ( Qur'an 12 :93) then God's mercy flew from Joseph's shirt to the eyes of Jacob (a) [59] and he sought tabarruk from it and regained his sight. Another example is that people of Moses (a) sought tabarruk from ark of covenant , which held belongings of the family of Moses (a) and Aaron (a) and the holy Tablets which were descended to Moses (a) and he trusted them to Joshua b. Nun . [60] People of Moses (a) regarded the ark of covenant very holy and carried it with themselves in wars with idol-worshippers and it was bearing tranquility for them. [61] It is mentioned in Qur'an, \"Their prophet said to them, 'Indeed the sign of his kingship shall be that the Ark will come to you, bearing tranquility from your Lord and the relics left behind by the House of Moses (a) and the House of Aaron(a), borne by the angels …\" ( Qur'an 2 :248) and they sought tabarruk from it. [62] Beside tabarruk, this act can also be an example of veneration which does not have any conflict with tabarruk; while actually, carrying the ark of covenant especially at the time of war could not have any purpose other than seeking tabarruk and help from it. [63] Maqam Ibrahim (a) (Station of Abraham) near Ka'ba , on which footprint of Abraham (a) can be seen, has been chosen for the place people pray, [64] \"And [remember] when We made the House a place of reward for mankind and a sanctuary, [declaring], 'Take the venue of prayer from Abraham's Station.' …\" ( Qur'an 2 :125) and people seek tabarruk from that stone because of that footprint [65] and therefore, seeking tabarruk from the seat of the Prophet (s) and the place of his prayer are permissible. [66] In a hadith, the place between al-Hajar al-Aswad and Abraham's (a) station has been introduced as the place many prophets have been buried and therefore it is blessed. [67] Conduct of the Prophet (s) Conduct of the Prophet (s) is a support for permissibility of seeking tabarruk. Some hadiths suggest that he (s) used to encourage his companions to seek tabarruk from him. Shi'a and Sunni historical and hadith texts have mentioned many such cases. For example, it is mentioned that he (s) told his companions to seek tabarruk from the well of the She-Camel of prophet Salih (a) and this is a permission for seeking tabarruk from whatever belongs or is attributed to prophets and righteous people even if they have passed on. On the night of Lady Fatima's (a) marriage, the noble Prophet (s) performed wudu and sprinkled the rest of the water of his wudu on the faces of Lady Fatima (a) and 'Ali (a) and asked God to bless them and their progeny. In a hadith, Imam 'Ali (a) says that for the blessings of the Prophet's (a) touch on his eyes which were very much in pain in the Battle of Khaybar , he (a) never felt sore eyes again. In another narration, it is mentioned that the Prophet (s) sprinkled the water of his wudu on a sick person and he was healed. In some narrations, it is mentioned that after performing hajj rituals , he (s) cut his hair ( Taqsir ) and Muslims shared out his hair among themselves. On the Night of Mi'raj , the Prophet (s) prayed where other prophets had prayed. Those prayers could not have any purpose other than that those places had been blessed by those prophets. In the process of burying Fatima bt. Asad , Imam 'Ali's (a) mother, the Prophet (s) shrouded her with his own clothes and before burying her, he laid in her grave for some moments so that the hardships of the grave become easy for her. 'Abd Allah b. Ubay asked the Prophet (s) to be buried in the Prophet's (a) clothes and this way he sought tabarruk from it to be forgiven and do not receive divine punishment. In the process of the treaty of Hudaybiyya , the delegate of Quraysh narrates that the companions of the Prophet (s) did not let even one drop of the water of his wudu drops on the ground and washed their faces with them. This happened before the Prophet (s) and he (s) did not prohibited them from doing it, therefore, it can be considered as an evidence for permissibility of seeking tabarruk. Even some other times, he (s) himself would tell the companions to seek tabarruk from the water of his wudu. Conduct of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) In historical texts, there are many cases of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) . After the Prophet (s) passed on, Fatima al-Zahra (a) visited his grave and rubbed the soil of his grave on her face. [78] Seeking tabarruk from the grave of the Prophet (s) was a permanent conduct of the Ahl al-Bayt (a). In hadith references, Seeking tabarruk from the grave of the Prophet (s) has been reported to be practiced by Imam al-Husayn (a) , [79] Imam al-Sadiq (a) , [80] Imam al-Rida (a) , [81] and Imam al-Jawad (a) . [82] Imam al-Hasan (a) made a will to be buried beside the Prophet (s) in case it does not become a point of dispute. [83] Other evidences of this conduct are seeking tabarruk to the Prophet's (a) walking stick by Imam al-Sadiq (a) [84] and also seeking tabarruk to remnants of the Prophet's (a) Hanut (camphor applied to one's corpse) by Imam 'Ali (a). [85] Conduct of the Companions and the Followers Both at the time of the Prophet (s) and also after he passed on, the companions sought tabarruk from him. Studying the lives of the Prophet (s) and his companions show that early Muslims sought tabarruk from him and what belonged to him. Seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) was for two reasons: both for achieving spiritual benefits from him and for showing him and his Ahl al-Bayt (a) respect and love. Since, respecting prophets and friend of God and what belong to them is an example of venerating signs of the Divine and the caution of the companions in cases of seeking tabarruk shows that as well as seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) himself, they also wanted to esteem and venerate those great people and show great love to them. Muslims' seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) was in three ways: Seeking tabarruk from the Prophet's (a) body, from what belonged to him, and from the places related to him. From the Prophet's (s) Body The Prophet's (a) companions kept his hair with themselves to seek tabarruk from. It is mentioned in historical reports and hadith references that in the process of the Treaty of Hudaybiyya , the Prophet (s) was cutting his hair, his companions gathered around him and picked every hair of the Prophet (s) which fell and kept with themselves to seek tabarruk from. Khalid b. Walid sought tabarruk from a headband which had some hair of the Prophet (s) on it and put it on in battles to gain victory. Seeking tabarruk from his sweat is another type of seeking tabarruk which is reported to have been practiced by his companions including Anas b. Malik and Umm Salim. There are also reports about blessing the water of the well of Hudaybiyya by remnants of his drinking water and also seeking tabarruk from the water of his wudu . Also in a report, it is mentioned that people cut the spout of a leather bottle from which the Prophet (s) drank water and kept it for themselves to seek tabarruk from it. In historical references, a list of twenty springs and well is mentioned which were blessed by the Prophet (s) and companions sought tabarruk from them frequently. From the Prophet's (s) Belongings What belonged to the Prophet (s) such as his walking stick, clothes, cloak, turban, shoes, prayer mat, handle of his sword, flag, and his bed were sought tabarruk from. From the Places Related to the Prophet (s) Early Muslims paid so much attention to the places which were somehow related with the Prophet (s) ; whether he (s) had prayed there, or sat there for a while and even passed by. A list of such places was reported by al-Fakihi in the 3rd/9th century titled as al-Mawadi' al-llati dakhalaha Rasul Allah (a) . 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar was among those who paid so much attention to places related to the Prophet (s). His attention especially towards seeking tabarruk from those places which suggests that it has been a common practice in the early Islamic history has been so much that some opposers of seeking tabarruk tried to justify 'Abd Allah's attention and practice and said that it has been a result of 'Abd Allah's own personal judgment not a result of religious proofs. However, some people refer to these hadiths and conclude that following what belonged to the Prophet (s) is recommended . Some of such places as mentioned above which were located in Mecca are: The Prophet's (a) birthplace, [110] Where he (s) sacrificed a camel after hajj rituals , [111] The place the Bay'a [allegiance] of Ridwan took place, [112] The cave where the Prophet's (s) immigration began, [113] Masjid al-Ghanam which was the place where people of Mecca paid allegiance with the Prophet (s) after the Conquest of Mecca , [114] Masjid al-Khif where the Prophet (s) made the sermon of Hajjat al-Wida' [115] and 700 prophets prayed and is very much recommended to be prayed in, [116] Masjid Radm al-A'la , Masjid al-Mukhtafi , House of Umm Hani , Masjid 'Urayd , [117] House of lady Khadija (a) where lady Fatima (a) was born, [118] House of Arqam b. Abi Arqam where Muslims hided from Meccan polytheists, [119] Masjid al-Ghadir where the Prophet (s) made the sermon of Ghadir , [120] The rock near Qubbat al-Wahy in al-Masjid al-Haram and it is said that greeted the Prophet (s), [121] The rock near Mecca which is said that in return from 'Umra , the Prophet (s) took rest on, [122] The stone on the corner of al-Masjid al-Haram on which the footprint of the Prophet (s) is made on it. [123] Holy sites in Medina including: The Prophet's (a) pulpit and al-Rawdat al-Nabawi , where reciting supplications is considered among religious manners agreed by all Muslims and Muslims used to pick the soil of his grave to seek tabarruk from. This became so common among Muslims which 'Aisha ordered to build a wall against the Prophet's (a) grave. Thawr and Hira' Caves, al-Shajara Mosque where the Prophet (s) put on Ihram , Masjid al-Ijaba where in return from 'Umra, the Prophet (s) prayed, Masjid al-Baghla and Masjid al-Fath , Quba Mosque for praying in which one receives great lot of rewards. From People Other than the Prophet (s) Muslims sought tabarruk from people other than the Prophet (s) as well. They did so during the Islamic history since the time of the Prophet (s) until now; for example, it is reported that the Prophet (s) sought tabarruk from the sweat on the forehead of Imam 'Ali (a) . Seeking tabarruk from the graves of other prophets and righteous people have been a common practice among Islamic scholars and Muslims. Some other cases of seeking tabarruk from other than the Prophet (s) are: The Glorious Qur'an and al-Hajar al-Aswad , Flag of Imam al-Hasan (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) , Sword of Ja'far al-Tayyar , The Qur'an attributed to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , Kiswah (curtain of Ka'ba ), Remnants of Ahl al-Bayt's (a) food, Mus'ab b. Zubayr seeking tabarruk from Imam al-Husayn (a), 'Umar b. al-Khattab seeking tabarruk from al-'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , Al-'Abbas seeking tabarruk from 'Ali (a), Remaining of the food or water of a believer contains cure, Water of the Euphrates river Water of Zamzam , Soil of Medina , Crown of Uways al-Qarani , Sword of Khalid b. Walid , Sword of Shurahbil b. Hasana, House of lady Fatima (a) , House of 'Aqil b. Abi Talib Great Mosque of Kufa . From the Graves of the Friends of God and Righteous People Seeking tabarruk from the graves has not been excluded to the grave of the Prophet (s) , and Muslims used to seek tabarruk from the graves of the companions , the followers and righteous people as well. Al-Subki believes that, according to religion and conduct of the righteous disciples of the Prophet (s), seeking tabarruk even from some righteous people who have passed on is also permissible. Some examples of seeking tabarruk practiced by the companions are from: Turba [Soil of the grave] of Imam al-Husayn (a) , Turba of Imam 'Ali b. Musa al-Rida (a) , [141] Turba of Imam Musa b. Ja'far (a) , [142] Grave of Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib in Uhud Cemetery , [143] Grave of Bilal al-Habashi in Syria , [144] Grave of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari in Istanbul , [145] Grave of Sayyida Nafisa in Egypt . [146] Also, there is a place in 'Asqalan called Maqam Ra's al-Husayn (a) which has sepulcher and mosque and it is said that the head of Imam al-Husayn (a) is buried there and thus local people seek tabarruk from it.

{"title": "Infallibility", "text": " ʿIṣma or Infallibility (Arabic: العِصمَة ) means abstinence from sins and from disobedience to God . The belief in the infallibility of the prophets and Imams , from intentional or unintentional sins, is a part of Shi'a creed. Infallibility from making mistakes in daily life issues –in addition to religious issues- is a matter of disagreement among scholars. Belief in the legitimacy of any religion and following its teachings precedes the substantiation of the infallibility of its prophet. In intra-faith discussions, the infallibility of the prophets (a) in receiving and conveying the divine revelation is demonstrated through rational arguments. However, infallibility in other practical aspects of their lives is mostly demonstrated through arguments driven by authoritative texts. Analysis of the Concept Literal Meaning The word 'isma ( عصمة ) literally means immunity; , however, it has been used in different meanings such as: chastity , preventing oneself from sins, the means for abstinence or immunity . Technical Meaning Muslim intellectuals and scholars have presented different definitions for infallibility ('isma). The most famous of which is the definition which connects 'isma to the divine benevolence ( luṭf ). According to this explanation, God grants 'isma to some human beings, thereupon, they will be immune to committing sins or disregarding obligations, while they have the freewill and capability of committing sins. Ash'ari viewpoint: Ash'ari theologians, because they believed in predestination (jabr) –that Human beings have no freewill (ikhtiyar) in their actions and behavior- have defined infallibility as the state in which the sins are not created by God in one particular human being. [5] Imamiyya and Mu'tazila viewpoint: Imamiyya and Mu'tazila theologians, based on their belief that the inherent good and evil (Ḥusn va Qubḥ) of things are known by reason and the principle of benevolence ( Qa'ida al-Luṭf ), have defined 'isma as deliberate abstinence from committing sins, because of divine benevolence bestowed upon one particular person. [6] Al-'Allama al-Hilli defines 'isma as a hidden kindness of God for His servant, which leaves no motivation in the servant for disregarding obligations or committing sins, while he/she is capable of both. [7] Although this state seems similar to the state of piety (taqwa), it is much higher than taqwa, to the level that it prevents the person from committing any indecent act even as a thought [8] and gains the person the highest levels of people's trust. [9] Origin of Infallibility Most scholars and thinkers have pointed to the existence of general capability and freewill for abstinence from sins in the infallible person. Thereof, a question arises: what causes the infallible to deliberately abstain from committing sins or be far from mistakes and negligence? Simply put, what is the origin of 'isma? In response to this question, several opinions have been put forth: The four means of divine benevolence : a group of theologians who have interpreted 'isma as a kind of divine benevolence ( luṭf ), believe the combination of four elements constitutes the basis of this divine kindness: The infallible person has certain physical and spiritual features and characteristics which enable him to abstain from the sins. The infallible person has complete awareness of the burdensome consequences of sins and the value of God's obedience. With continued divine revelation or inspiration, this awareness expands and becomes more profound. Not only because of disregarding obligations, the infallible will also be questioned about disregarding the recommended priorities; therefore, he knows there's no negligence or leniency about his actions and behavior (because of the heavy responsibility he bears). [10] Knowledge and Awareness of the Consequences of Sins : some believe that infallibility originated from a kind of intuitive knowledge about the reality of sin and its burdensome consequences and the reality of acts of obedience and their pleasant results. This knowledge is so strong that the infallible vividly sees these realities and consequences; therefore, he or she never even thinks about committing sins or disregarding divine obligations. [11] Freewill and Choice : another theory about the origin of 'isma identifies it with some kind of strong and internalized piety. This internalization is the result of repeating good deeds and continued abstinence from sins. However, this internalization is much more intensified in the state of 'isma, in comparison to the general state of piety. Repetition of correct actions requires freewill and determination, therefore, the main element in possessing the state of 'isma originates from the choice and freewill of the infallible. According to this theory, even the aforementioned intuitive knowledge about the realities of different actions and the ugliness of sin is a result of this strong will and determination by the infallible. [12] Knowledge and Will : some Muslim thinkers identify the basis of 'isma in two elements: knowledge of the facts about perfection, and strong will in acquiring perfection. For in the case of ignorance, man does not know the difference between real or delusional perfection, and in the case of weak will, man will be controlled by his selfish and carnal desires and will not reach real perfection. [13] A combination of natural, personal, and divine elements : some contemporary thinkers believe that 'isma does not have a single cause, rather it is the result of the combination of different elements, natural element (that is: genetic endowment, environment and family), personal element (that is: consciousness and awareness, will power and choice, intellect, and internalized virtues) and the divine element which is the special divine grace for the person. [14] Infallibility of the Prophets Range The discussion about the infallibility of the prophets expands to different degrees and levels and at each level, various debates have taken place among thinkers and theologians. These discussions range from immunity from polytheism and disbelief ( Kufr ) to immunity from normal mistakes. Immunity from polytheism and disbelief : there is no disagreement among different Islamic denominations and theologians about the infallibility of the Prophets from polytheism and disbelief (Kufr). All Muslims believe that all the prophets, whether before their prophethood or after it, did not commit any form of polytheism and disbelief. [15] Infallibility in receiving, preserving and conveying the divine revelation : main figures among Shi'a and Sunni theologians believe that the prophets are immune from sin, deliberate dishonesty [16] or mistake [17] , in the process of receiving, preserving and conveying the divine revelation . Upon this level of infallibility, divine prophets declare to people what has been revealed to them, without any change or alteration. Out of Divine wisdom, God chooses a person for this mission who would not commit any form of dishonesty. Infallibility in following religious practical laws : according to the famous view among Shi'a theologians, prophets are immune from deliberate sins or accidental mistakes in practicing religious obligations or avoiding religious prohibitions. [18] Infallibility in specifying cases of different practical laws : the subject of religious practical law is the action about which a certain religious ruling has been issued. Like prayers that has been made obligatory, and backbiting that has been prohibited. What is meant in this level of 'isma is that prophets do not commit deliberate dishonesty in recognizing the subjects, but what about accidental mistakes? For instance, is it possible for a prophet to mistakenly miss one of his prayers? Shi'a and Sunni theologians disagree over the extension of infallibility to this level. Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite thinkers believe the Prophets can make mistakes in recognizing the subjects of religious practical laws or in their application. Among Imamiyya theologians too, al-Shaykh al-Saduq believes there's no infallibility at this level and regards the belief in prophet's Immunity from mistakes and Sahw (general negligence), as an exaggerative belief that is advocated by Ghulat and Mufawwida ; however the common view among Shi'a theologians is the existence of infallibility at this level. Infallibility from mistakes in usual daily affairs : in this context, \"daily affairs\" are cases which, have no connection to religion per se and there is no religious law –whether obligation or prohibition- concerning them. Except for a case where such mistakes lead to public distrust, there's no rational argument in favor of the infallibility of the prophets from all mistakes in daily affairs; actually, historical reports are found in traditional collections that narrate such mistakes in the lives of the prophets. Necessity Considering the extent of the infallibility of the prophets, the necessity of each level can be explained. The Infallibility pertaining to the process of revelation (receiving, preserving, and conveying the revelation) is essential for the main mission of a prophet, which is conveying the divine message to the public, which must be guaranteed and preserved from any deliberate or accidental change and alteration. Revelation has its proper function only when it is preserved and protected from any deliberate or accidental error and distortion, from the moment it is issued, till the moment it is declared to people. Otherwise, people lose their trust and God's purpose of sending messengers and establishing religions will remain unfulfilled. Similarly, the infallibility in other areas is to guarantee the general reliability of the prophets. The absence of such reliability results in general distrust toward the main divine message and the goal of sending messengers will be ruined. Proofs Muslim thinkers have different opinions regarding the proofs of the infallibility of the prophets. An essential aspect of this discussion is that each level of 'isma requires its specific reason. On certain levels, infallibility can be demonstrated through rational arguments –as mentioned above- on some other levels, it only can be inferred from authoritative texts (verses of the Holy Qur'an or Hadith ). Therefore, the proof for each level must be discussed separately. Infallibility concerning polytheism and disbelief even before prophethood: The argument for this degree of infallibility is that a prophet's words and claims can be trusted only if they were not polytheists or unbelievers even before their prophethood. Infallibility in receiving and conveying the revelations: This degree of infallibility is demonstrated by rational arguments, because even if there is a possibility of mistakes in receiving and conveying the revelations, then that will defeat God's purpose from sending prophets, and it is not possible for God to defeat His purpose. The Qur'an says in this regard: al-Haqqa 44-47. Infallibility in the detection of jurisprudential rulings: The argument for this is that rational persons do not trust someone who even makes unintentional mistakes; for example, they do not trust such people with their possessions and money. So, how can they trust such a person and receive their religious rulings from him? Infallibility concerning ordinary affairs: if the mistakes at this level are not to the extent that leads to people's distrust of the prophet, then there is no rational or transmission-based argument for the impossibility of such mistakes, and if such mistakes are to the extent that leads to people's distrust, then the above rational argument will apply here as well. Infallibility of the Imams Necessity Since Imam is the successor of the Prophet (s) and the authoritative source of religious knowledge, including practical laws, spiritual teachings of the religion, exegeses of the Qur'an , and Sunna of the Prophet (s), he must be immune from mistakes or sins so that people can trust him and his words. Otherwise, people would lose their trust in him and God's purpose in appointing an Imam for guidance will not be fulfilled. Extent The infallibility of the Imams includes two main areas: Practice and Knowledge 1- Infallibility in Practice: this includes Imam's actions and behavior and has two levels: a. The infallible never disregards an obligation, nor commits a prohibited action b. The infallible never disregards a recommendation nor commits a reprehensible action 2- Infallibility in Knowledge: this includes the knowledge of issues related to his duty as an Imam and it has three levels: a. He does not make mistakes in religious knowledge, for he is the guide of people. b. He is infallible in his social and political decisions. Also, his decisions in scholarly leadership are perfect and correct. c. He is infallible in the application of religious practical laws and does not make mistakes in this regard. For instance, in discerning whether a given liquid is water or wine, he does not make a mistake. Arguments Rational Arguments Infinite Regress: according to this argument, the existence of the Imam originates from divine benevolence; he is the guide to whom people refer to recognize the right path. If the Imam is not infallible and possibly makes errors, there must be another Imam to correct him, and if the chain does not end in an infallible person, the probability of mistake and error remains. [25] Preserving the religion and presenting its correct interpretation: this argument comprises several premises: Following Imam's order is obligatory upon Muslims. If the Imam is not infallible and orders Muslims to commit sins, they are left with two options: (neither is possible) neither of the above is possible, so Imam must be infallible. Arguments based on Authoritative Texts Holy Qur'an The Verse about the Trial of Ibrahim \"And when his Lord tested Ibrahim with certain words, and he fulfilled them, He said, 'I am making you the Imam of mankind.' Said he (Ibrahim), 'And from among my descendants?' He said, 'My pledge does not extend to the unjust.'\" (Qur'an 2:124) This verse relates to the time when Prophet Ibrahim (a) had fulfilled the divine tests successfully. In addition to his previous position as an Ulu l-'Azm Prophet , upon the fulfillment of these tests, he reached the position of Imama. The argument of Imamiyya theologians and interpreters is as follows: Whoever commits sins is an unjust person, for he has transgressed the bounds of God (disregarded religious laws): ... and whoever transgresses the bounds of Allah, it is they who are unjust. (Qur'an 2:229) an unjust person cannot be in the position of Imama: My pledge does not extend to the unjust. (Qur'an 2:124) in the context of the verse, injustice includes all forms of injustice, whether about oneself or others or injustice in issues pertaining to the divine law, it also includes those who have committed injustice only once in their lives. Hereupon, a person who is not infallible has committed injustice, and an unjust person cannot reach the position of Imama. [29] Uli l-Amr Verse \"O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority among you.\" (Qur'an 4:59) The argument based on this verse has two premises: 1- The conjunction used between the word 'Rasul' (Apostle) and the word 'Uli l-Amr' (those vested with authority) is 'waw' (Arabic: واو , and) which indicates that the obedience to Uli l-Amr -like the obedience to the Apostle- is unconditional. 2- Whenever God obligates unconditional obedience to a particular person, it postulates the infallibility of that person. For if that person is not infallible, he might issue wrong orders, in that case, people must both obey and refuse his command. They must obey him because God has made obligatory the absolute obedience to the Uli l-Amr; similarly, they must refuse because, according to the famous and Mutawatir narration from the Prophet (s), \"there's no obedience to the created (when it results) in disobedience to the Creator.\" Tathir Verse \"Indeed Allah desires to repel all impurity only from you, O Ahl al-Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification.\" (Qur'an 33:33) The argument based on this verse consists of six premises: God has willed to purify only the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , The Tashri'i divine will for purification is general, not particular, The divine will in the verse cannot be a Tshri'i divine will, since the will in the verse is restricted to one particular group, i.e. the Ahl al-Bayt (a) therefore it is a Takwini divine will , The Takwini divine will is inevitably fulfilled, The purification is stressed and unconditional, which means all sorts of impurities are repelled, Except for Shi'a, none of the other Muslim sects have ever claimed the infallibility of their leaders, in fact, there's no historical evidence that anyone has ever claimed to be the addressee of this verse, or used the title \"Ahl al-Bayt\" except for Lady Fatima al-Zahra (a) , her husband, Imam Ali (a) and their children. So Ahl al-Bayt (a) containing Imam 'Ali (a), Lady Fatima (a), Imam al-Hasan (a) , and Imam al-Husayn (a) and other Shi'a Imams are infallible. Hadith Hadith al-Thaqalayn The Holy Prophet (s) said: \"I have left among you two things, you will never go astray after me, should you hold onto them. These are two weighty things, the one which is greater than the other, is the Book of Allah , an extended rope from heaven to earth and my 'Itra, Ahl al-Bayt (household), be aware that they will not separate till the time they meet me near the al-Hawdh (pond).\" This Hadith proves the infallibility of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) from different perspectives: According to this narration, the Prophet (s) directs all Muslims to have unconditional obedience to the Holy Qur'an and his household. Unconditional obedience postulates infallibility, for it is impossible for God and his Apostle to introduce a fallible person, who might make mistakes and contradict the Holy Qur'an and the Sunna of the Prophet (s), as the guide for people. In this narration the inseparability between the Qur'an and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) has been emphasized. Committing a sin or making a mistake means separation from the Qur'an, while the Prophet (s) has confirmed the inseparable bond between the two, until the Day of Judgment . - In this Hadith, the Holy Qur'an and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are introduced as the guides who save their followers from deviation; this function is only possible when the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are infallible and immune from sins and mistakes. \"Ali is with the truth and truth is with Ali\" 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Sa'd has narrated from his father: we were sitting in a group of Muhajirun and Ansar near the house of the Prophet (s) when Ali (a) came. The Apostle of God (s) asked: do you want me to introduce to you the best among you? \"Yes,\" they replied. The Prophet (s) said: 'The best among you are those who keep their covenant and use perfume. God likes the pious servants.' At this very moment Ali b. Abi Talib (a) passed by us, the Apostle of God (s) said: he is with the truth and truth is with him. This Hadith is explicitly stating the infallibility of Imam Ali (a) , for infallibility means nothing but the continual companionship with the truth and righteousness, and immunity from mistakes and sins in words and deeds. The Apostle of God (s) testifies that Imam Ali (a) is always and in all situations with the truth and never separates from the truth. With this testimony, the absolute infallibility of Imam Ali (a) from any sin or mistake is demonstrated, for the actions and words of a fallible person are not always associated with the truth. So the belief in the infallibility of Imam Ali (a) is necessary; otherwise, it entails the rejection of the testimony of the Prophet of Islam (s). Narration about Imam Ali (a) and the Imams of his progeny The Prophet of Islam (s) said: whoever wishes to look at the red ruby stick which God has planted with His hands and hold onto it, he should have the Wilaya of 'Ali and the Imams from his progeny, for they are the chosen ones by God and the pure ones and the infallible from all sins and mistakes. This Hadith explicitly states the infallibility of Shi'a Imams. Infallibility of Angels ... over which (fire) are [assigned] angels, severe and mighty, who do not disobey whatever God has commanded them, and carry out what they are commanded. Holy Qur'an: 66:6 Angels are beings that are pure from any form of disobedience and sin . However, based on the general definition of 'isma, the term is accurately used for beings that have freewill and the ability to disobey God's commands, but refrain from committing sins, and are supported by the divine benevolence, they are immune to mistakes which entail mistrust. According to this definition, while angels are pure from disobedience, they do not have the position of 'isma in the proper sense of the term. However in the extended application of the term, i.e. purity from sins and mistakes (whether out of freewill or by nature) angels are infallible as well since they do not tend sins. They are engaged in everlasting glorification and praise of God and always obey divine commands.

{"title": "Sama' al-Mawta (dead ones' hearing)", "text": "Samāʿ al-Mawtā (Arabic: سماعُ الْمَوْتَىٰ , the dead ones' hearing) or Samāʿ al-Amwāt is the power of the dead in hearing the voice of living people and communicating with them in the world of Barzakh . This is among issues This is among issues Wahhabis came into conflict with Muslims . Moreover, accepting some ideological issues such as making entreaty to dead ones depend on it. In hadiths , there is a mention of the life of dead ones in Barzakh and also their power to communicate with living people including hearing their voices. These hadiths have been narrated in Sunni sources and some prominent figures of Salafism such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim have referred to them and thus accepted \"Sama' Mawta\". Concept Literally, \"sama' al-mawta\" means \"the dead ones' hearing\" or delivering a message to dead ones. It means that dead people have the power to hear the voices of living people and communicate with them in the world of Barzakh . If the life in the world of Barzakh is denied, the possibility of communicating with dead ones will also be nullified. Reasons Qur'anic Evidences The conversation of Prophet Salih (a) and Prophet Shu'ayb (a) with their perished people, and the Qur'an 's order to the Prophet (s) to speak with previous prophets (a) are among Qur'anic evidence. Ibn Hajar and Qadi Taqi al-Din al-Sabki are among Sunni scholars who have referred to verse 169 of Sura 3 to prove the life of dead people in the world of Barzakh and sama' al-mawta. Hadiths In some hadiths, the communication with dead ones, especially their power to hear the voices of living people are mentioned; some such hadiths mentioned in Sunni sources are as follows: A dead person hears the footstep of those who follow his body in the funeral [6] and answers people. [7] After the Prophet (s) passed away, he (s) would answer his people's greetings. [8] After the Battle of Badr , the noble Prophet (s) spoke with disbelievers who were killed and were dumped into a well. 'Umar objected to the Prophet (s) saying that, \"they are dead and do not hear you!\", The noble Prophet (s) answered, \"you do not hear me better than them; the only thing is that they can't answer.\" [9] The Prophet's (s) advised to visit graves in these hadiths and said that, \"dead people hear you and answer your greetings\". [10] Also, he (s) himself addressed dead people in the al-Baqi' and said, \"Peace be with you in the abode of the believers. You received what you were promised for tomorrow, and you are delayed (here between death and Judgment Day ); and we will God-willing join you.\" [11] [12] In addition to the mentioned hadiths, there are other evidences for sama' al-mawta in Shi'a sources such as the conversation of Imam 'Ali (a) with those who were killed in the Battle of Jamal . The religious order for dictation ( talqin ) of the beliefs of the dead person to repeat them upon burial suggests that they must hear, otherwise, it would be useless. Wahhabis' Views Some Wahhabis refer to the verses of Qur'an such as Qur'an 35 verse 22: \"and you cannot make those who are in the graves hear you\" and Qur'an 27 verse 80 and Qur'an 30 verse 52, \"You cannot make the dead hear\", reject sama' al-mawta and believe that with death , the communication between dead ones and living people will be broken and there would be no possibility that dead ones hear the voice of the living. However, some Salafis such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim have accepted sama' al-mawta. Those who reject sama' mawta, mention a narration from 'Ayisha about the Prophet's (s) speaking with the dead ones of the Battle of Badr that he (s) said, \"they know now what I say\" instead of \"they hear what I say\". However, most Sunni thinkers have not accepted this report. Answer Advocates of sama' al-mawta believe that the dead in the Qur'anic verses like Qur'an 27 :80, Qur'an 30 :52, and Qur'an 35 :22, refers to disbelievers . They refer to the verse 81 of Quran 27, \"Nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can make only those hear you who believe in Our signs and have submitted\" and consider likening disbelievers to blind ones suggesting that the dead ones in Sura 27:80 refer to disbelievers. Also, they interpret sama' (making someone hear) as \"accepting\" and say that disbelievers can hear the voice of the Prophet (s) and he (s) can deliver his voice to them, but they do not accept his words. Also, they refer to a part of the verse Qur'an 27:81 saying that \"who believe in Our signs\" which has exempted believers and interpret sama' as \"accepting\" and mawta as \"disbelievers\".

{"title": "Life in Barzakh", "text": "Life in Barzakh refers to the life of souls in Barzakh which is required for an account of some religious facts such as dead ones' hearing and tawassul . For the proof of life in Barzakh, appeals are made to certain Qur'anic verses referring to the life of some groups of dead people, such as martyrs as well as some hadiths . Definition \"Life in Barzakh\" refers to the life of the dead in the inter-world or the Barzakh. According to some Qur'anic verses and hadiths, the souls of the dead enjoy life in the Barzakh and can make certain communications with people in this world. They hear the voices of people in this world and can respond to them. Barzakh Body The human body in the Barzakh is referred to as the Barzakh body or \"Mithali body\" (analogical body) to which the soul is attached after death. The Barzakh body is said not to be material, although it has certain material properties and features, such as shape and size. In Qur'an There are about 10 Qur'anic verses to which it is appealed to prove the life in Barzakh , such as verses referring to the postmortem life of certain groups of the dead, such as martyrs . There are also Qur'anic verses referring to conversations between the angels and the dead, a Heaven and a Hell in Barzakh, as well as verses referring to the life of the prophets in Barzakh. The Shi'as appeal to the verse Qur'an 9 :105 to show that the Prophet (s) and certain believers (that is, the Imams (a) ) are aware of people in this world. Thus, they appeal to this verse to show the life in Barzakh. In Hadith There are hadiths referring to the life of the prophets in Barzakh. Al-Bayhaqi has collected some such hadiths in his book, Hayat al-anbiya' ba'd wafatihim (the life of the prophets after their death). According to a hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (s) met the Prophet Moses (a) in the night of Mi'raj in his grave while he was saying prayers. Some Sunni scholars have explicitly maintained the life of the prophets in Barzakh. Al-Alusi takes the life of the prophets in Barzakh to be superior to that of the martyrs, saying that the life of prophets in Barzakh can be proved by reliable hadiths. The Shi'as have also appealed to certain hadiths, some of which are collected in the section, \"a section on the issue that the Imams (a) are witnesses of God, the Exalted, on His creatures,\" of the book, al-kafi , showing that the Imams (a) are aware of people in this world with the permission of God. They take these hadiths to show life in Barzakh. Wahhabi View Some Salafids , such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim, have accepted the life in Barzakh. But some Wahhabis have a specific view of the life in Barzakh according to which the souls of the dead cannot communicate with people in this world and hear their voices. But, proponents of the life in Barzakh believe that the denial of the life in Barzakh is not compatible with Qur'anic verses referring to the postmortem life, such as the ones according to which the prophets and friends of God enjoy life in the World of Barzakh, just as the Qur'an has explicitly referred to the postmortem life of the martyrs. Also, according to Islam, death does not amount to one's annihilation; rather it is a transfer from one world to another, and it is possible for people in this world to communicate with the souls in the world of Barzakh. Moreover, they argue that if the life in Barzakh, and in particular, the life of the prophets in Barzakh, is not accepted, then certain Qur'anic addresses, such as salutations on the prophets , God's command to the Prophet Muhammad (s) to talk with previous prophets , and the Qur'an's order to the believers to send regards to the Prophet (s) , will not make sense. They take as evidence for their claim the speeches of Salih (a) and Shu'ayb (a) addressing their punished and perished peoples, the Prophet's (s) speech to the killed polytheists after the Battle of Badr , and the speech of Imam 'Ali (a) to people who were killed in the Battle of Jamal .

{"title": "Tawhid", "text": "Tawḥīd (Arabic: التَوحيد ), or monotheism is the most fundamental doctrine in Islam , which means believing in the oneness and uniqueness of God and not ascribing any partners to Him. The message of the Prophet Muhammad (s) since the beginning of his mission was based on the call for tawhid and the rejection of polytheism . Tawhid is a major theme in the Qur'an and hadiths . Al-Tawhid is also one of the names of sura 112 of the Qur'an, which presents a brief but deep expression of the doctrine. In Islam, tawhid stands in contrast to shirk (ascribing partners to God). Muslim theologians have counted a number of levels for tawhid: al-tawhid al-dhati (unity of the divine essence), which refers to the belief in God as the only God and negating any partners for Him; al-tawhid al-sifati (unity of the divine attributes), which refers to the identity of divine essence with divine attributes; al-tawhid al-af'ali (unity of actions), which refers to the fact that God is the only independent cause and that He needs no assistance for His actions; al-tawhid al-'ibadi (unity of worship), which refers to the fact that no one other than God deserves to be worshiped . There are various arguments for tawhid in the Qur'an, hadiths, and the works of Muslim philosophers and theologians. The argument of tamanu' (Argument of Antagonism), the argument from appointing prophets , and the Argument of the Impossibility of Multiplicity are some of the arguments presented by Muslim theologians and philosophers for tawhid. Some Sunnis, including Ibn Taymiyya , Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab , and 'Abd al-'Aziz Bin Baz, have regarded asking for shafa'a and tawassul as instances of shirk. Based on the teachings of the Qur'an, other Muslims reject this idea and maintain that there is no problem in asking for intercession when the intercessor is not considered divine and asking for intercession is done just to honor the intercessor and get closer to God through them. Shiite scholars have written extensively on the topic of tawhid. Some of their works are devoted exclusively to tawhid, and others are parts of works on theology. Some of these books are al-Tawhid by al-Shaykh al-Saduq , Gowhar-i murad by 'Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji , al-Rasa'il al-tawhidiyya by Allama Tabatabai , and Tawhid by Morteza Motahhari . Meaning Tawhid, in the sense of believing in the oneness of God, is the most fundamental Islamic doctrine, according to which the One God is the sole creator of the world and does not have any partners. Tawhid is also used, as seen in some hadiths, to mean confessing this doctrine. Sometimes the term tawhid refers to the theological discussions related to God, His attributes, and actions. According to hadiths , the Prophet (s) used the word to mean the affirmation of the proposition \"lā ilāh illā Allāh, waḥdah lā sharīk lah\" ( لا إله إلا ألله، وحده لاشريک له , there is no god except Allah, he is one and has no partner). In response to questions about tawhid, Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) have brought up some theological discussions such as negating human attributes from God. There are three different types of tawhid, Theological tawhid, which refers to the belief in the oneness of God based on theological arguments; Philosophical tawhid, which is the belief in the oneness of God based on purely rational arguments; Mystical tawhid, which goes beyond concepts and refers to witnessing the One [4] Being from whom all beings originate. In Mulla Sadra's Transcendental Philosophy , all these types of Tawhid are combined and mystical experiences have been juxtaposed with intellectual arguments. Place in Islam Tawhid is regarded as the most important characteristic teaching of Islam. As the Qur'an stipulates, all the prophets (a) called people to tawhid. Although the term \"tawhid\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an, there are many Qur'anic verses that are related to the affirmation of tawhid and negation of polytheism, such that the main purpose of the Qur'an is considered by Mulla Sadra in his exegesis to be the affirmation of tawhid. Confessing tawhid and rejecting polytheism are among the first teachings of the Prophet (s), which he proclaimed at the beginning of his mission in Mecca . The representatives that the Prophet (s) sent to various places, such as Mu'adh b. Jabal , would first and foremost call people to tawhid. Imam Ali (a) states that believing in the oneness of God is the foundation of knowing God. Tawhid is emphasized in the Qur'an in various words and expressions. Negating other gods, emphasizing the oneness of God for all, condemning polytheists, rejecting the Trinity, and negating anything that is similar to God are among the themes related to tawhid in the Qur'an. Some of the Qur'anic verses about tawhid are, Say, 'He is Allah, the One'. ( Qur'an 112 :1) There is no god except Allah. ( Qur'an 37 :35, Qur'an 47 :19) Your god is the One God, there is no god except Him. ( Qur'an 2 :163) Your God is the One God. ( Qur'an 18 :110, Qur'an 21 :108, Qur'an 41 :6) There is no god except Allah, the One. ( Qur'an 38 :65) Levels In accordance with the Qur'an and the sayings of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) , many theologians, philosophers, and mystics have counted several levels for tawhid: Al-Tawhid al-dhati (unity of the essence), Al-Tawhid al-sifati (unity of the attributes), Al-Tawhid al-af'ali (unity of actions), Al-Tawhid al-'ibadi (unity of worship). [13] In Islam, tawhid is in contrast with shirk (ascribing partners to God), and thus eliminating shirk is one of the main themes and aims of the Qur'an. Just as different levels have been mentioned for tawhid, shirk also is considered to have different levels: al-shirk al-dhati is the belief in more than one God; al-shirk al-af'ali is the belief in more than one independent cause in the world; al-shirk al-sifati is the belief in the ontological multiplicity of God's attributes and their distinction from His essence, and al-shirk al-'ibadi is worshipping something other than the one God. Unity of the Essense Unity of the essence is the first stage of monotheism, consisting in the belief in the oneness of divine essence. That is, the divine essence is not subject to plurality and has no peer. In the terminologies of theology and philosophy , Unity of essence has two meanings: God is one, it has no peer, and it is inconceivable for Him to have a second. The divine essence is simple, in the sense of not being composed of parts. [21] Qur'an 112 (Sura al-Tawhid), refers to both kinds of Unity of essense: the word 'Aḥad' at the beginning of this sura refers to the simplicity of divine essence, and the last verse ('there is none like unto Him') refers to the rejection of any peers and partners about God. Unity of the Attributes Unity of the attributes is the view that the divine essence is identical with divine attributes. Thus, the divine knowledge is not distinct from divine power; all His being is both knowledge, power, and other attributes through and through, and all His attributes are identical to one another and to his essence. Contrary to other beings, in which attributes are distinct from their essence, and they gain the attributes. Qur'an has cleared God from the attributes. In a speech narrated by Abu Basir , Imam al-Sadiq (a) attributes divine knowledge, hearing, sight and power to divine essence and has stipulated that God has been able to hear and see before there had been anything to be heard or seen. Unity of Actions Unity of actions (al-tawhid al-af'ali) is the view that in order to do His acts, God does not need anything or anyone other than His own essence—He is independent in all His acts. According to the unity of actions, nothing in the world can have any effects or do anything except in virtue of the power it is given by God; all actions, movements, and effects are originated in His essence. He has no partners in His essence, He has no partners in His agency—including creation, monitoring, owning, and governing the world. Qur'an introduces God as the creator of everything and the one, all paramount. Imam al-Sadiq (a) has considered God as the only one who can create something from nothing. Unity of Worship Unity of worship is a sort of theoretical monotheism, which amounts to the thought that nothing except Allah is worthy of worshiping—that is, there is no god except Allah. Therefore, every person has to worship God and on the basis of His commands. According to Qur'an inviting to worship the One God is the primary mission of all of the prophets . Monotheism in worship has been referred to by some Qur'anic verses, such as Qur'an 6:102, Qur'an 1 :2-5, Qur'an 21 :25. This is taken to be implied by other types of monotheism: if our existence is from Allah, our survival depends on Him, the only truly independent cause in the world is Allah, and it is only Allah who has the right to command and legislate, then no one else is worthy of worship. Any non-divine motivations involving in worships reduces their value and it sometimes leads to their religious invalidity. Arguments In the Qur'an and hadiths and in the works of Muslim philosophers and theologians, a number of arguments have been mentioned for tawhid. Some of these arguments are as follows: Argument of Tamanu' (mutual exclusion), which is based on Qur'an 21 :22 [34] , seeks to demonstrate tawhid by refuting shirk. [35] This argument has been formulated in the following way: If there were two gods and one of them willed to do something and the other willed to do its opposite, one of the following would happen: Argument of Multiplicity is among the arguments set forth in Islamic philosophy for the oneness of God. According to this argument, if there were more than one god (or necessary existent), each of them would have a common aspect with the other gods—as they all are necessary existents—and an exclusive aspect. This means that each god is combined of a common aspect and an exclusive aspect. However, this is impossible, because a necessary existent cannot be a compound being, as every compound being is in need of its parts, and therefore its existence is not necessary by itself. Therefore, there is only one necessary existent. [37] Other arguments have also been presented by Muslim theologians and philosophers for the oneness of God, such as the Argument of Specificity (ta'ayyun), the Argument of the Impossibility of Multiplicity , the Argument of the Multiplicity of the Objects of Power , and the Argument from Appointing the Prophets . The latter is taken from Imam Ali's (a) letter to his son Imam al-Hasan (a) , in which it is stated that if God had any partners, they would send their prophets to people. Accusations Against the Shi'a Wahhabis regard the Shiite practice of asking the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) for intercession and seeking the blessings of their graves and relics as shirk. However, the Shi'a reject this accusation and believe that those who do so never intend to worship these friends of God and do not believe in their divinity. Their intention is only to honor those righteous servants of God and to get closer to God by honoring them. According to Ibn Taymiyya , whoever asks Imam Ali (a) for intercession is an infidel and whoever doubts the infidelity of such a person is also an infidel . Moreover, he maintained that whoever visits the grave of the Propeht (s) or anyone else and asks them for something is a polytheist , who must be required to repent or be killed if he refuses to repent. Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz, the contemporary Wahhabi mufti, also considered asking the dead for healing or victory over the enemies as instances of the greater shirk. Based on the Qur'an , the Shia reject the act of asking for intercession only if the one who is asked for intercession is considered as acting independently of God and His permission. It is this case that is an instance of the greater shirk in the lordship of God. In response to Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab and his followers who adduce the Qur'anic verses that criticize polytheists for seeking the intercession of their gods, Shiite scholars point to the fundamental difference between their action and the Shiite practice of asking the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) for intercession, which is the fact that, unlike the polytheists, Shiites do not believe in the divinity of the Prophet (s) or the Imams (a) and do not regard them as independent agents of intercession. Bibliography Shiite scholars have authored many works related to the topic of tawhid. These works include the ones that are exclusively on the topic of tawhid and the ones that discuss this topic along other beliefs and doctrines. Some of these works are as follows: Kitab al-Tawhid by al-Shaykh al-Saduq , which is basically a collection of hadiths related to the oneness of God, His attributes , free will and predestination , and so forth. Sharh bab hadi 'ashar by Miqdad b. 'Abd Allah al-Suyuri about the principles of Shiite beliefs. Its first chapter concerns monotheism. [47] The book Bab hadi 'ashar was written by al-'Allama al-Hilli .

Tawhid , a transcription of 17 lectures by Morteza Motahhari , delivered in 1967-8, [49] in 346 pages. The book largely consists of replies to objections about the relation between monotheism and the theory of evolution as well as the problem of evil. [50] Al-Tawhid wa-l-shirk fi l-Qur'an al-karim by Ja'far Subhani . In the four chapters of this book, the author begins with a statement of seven degrees of monotheism and a definition of worships , and then addresses Wahhabi beliefs and their criteria for monotheism and polytheism . Ayatullah Subhani published another book titled Buhuth Qur'aniyya fi l-tawhid wa-l-shirk in Arabic, which also concerns monotheism, polytheism, and Wahhabi objections. A chief part of the book (three out of five chapters) is about monotheism in worship . [51] Tawhid wa shirk dar nigah-i Shi'a wa Wahhabiyyat , by Ahmad 'Abidi is, as the author says, a response to the claims in the book Usul madhhab al-Shi'a al-Imamiyya al-ithna'ashariyya by Nasir al-Qafari , who graduated from Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in Saudi Arabia . [52] In this book, Ahmad 'Abidi provides an account of oneness in divinity, oneness in lordship, and oneness of names and attributes, and finally the faith and its tenets from a Shiite perspective, and in arguing for the advantage of Shiite beliefs over Wahhabi beliefs concerning monotheism, the author criticizes Nasir al-Qafari’s approach.

{"title": "Usul al-Din", "text": " Uṣūl al-dīn (Arabic: أصول الدین ) or principles of religion or roots of faith are a set of essential beliefs in Islam that every Muslim needs to believe in; otherwise, one would not be considered a Muslim. Tawhid (oneness of God), nubuwwat (prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) ), and resurrection are the three main principles of Islam. All Islamic sects believe in these three principles; but each one has special principles which separate it from other sects. For the Shi'a , 'adl (justice of God) and imamate are the additional principles. Believing in the principles of religion is obligatory; but there is disagreement as to whether certainty of the principles is required or supposition is enough. Also there is a discussion over the sufficiency of believing in the principles of religion out of emulation . Most religious scholars believe that emulation is not permissible in usul al-din and everyone needs to think about these principles for oneself and accept them with certainty. Definition \"Usul al-din\" is a theological term referring to the fundamental beliefs of Islam the belief in which is required for being considered a Muslim . Such beliefs are called \"usul al-din\" (principles or foundations of the religion) because Islamic disciplines, such as fiqh , usul al-fiqh , the exegesis of the Qur'an , and hadith , are based on them. The word, \"usul al-din\", is contrasted to \" furu' al-din \" (ancillaries of the religion) which refers to the practical rulings of the religion. Muslim theologians have referred to the principles of the religion in different ways such as \"usul al-i'tiqadat\" (Arabic: أصول إعتقادات , principles of beliefs), \"usul al-iman\" (Arabic: أصول إیمان , principles of the faith), \"ummahat 'aqa'id imani\" (Arabic: أمهات عقائد إيماني , the main faith-based beliefs), and \"usul Islami\" (Arabic: أصول الإسلامي , Islamic principles), and so on. However, what they meant to refer with these terms was not restricted to what are taken today as principles of Islam. In many cases, ethical and jurisprudential issues were also referred to as the principles of the religion. For example, al-Ghazali referred to all theological as well as many jurisprudential and ethical issues as the principles of the religion. He considered the prayer and piety as principles of the religion, along with monotheism . According to Misbah Yazdi , \"usul al-din\" is a conventional term which can be used in different meanings. In one convention, it refers to all belief-related propositions of the religion. In another convention, it refers to the fundamental propositions of divine religions or a specific religion. It might as well refer to the principles of a religious denomination; for example, one can say that, for the Shi'a, the principles of the religion consist in monotheism, the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) , the Resurrection , justice , and imamate , just as Morteza Motahhari has considered these five beliefs to be the principles of the religion according to the Shi'a. Instances The principles of Islam consist in monotheism , the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s), and the Resurrection. Anyone who believes in these three doctrines is considered to be a Muslim, and anyone who does not believe in any of these doctrines is not considered as a Muslim. However, there are disagreements among Muslims with respect to the details of these principles. For instance, the majority of Shiite and Mu'tazila theologians believe in the identification of God's Attributes with His Essence, but Ash'aris maintain that God's Attributes are over and above, and external to, His Essence. Morteza Motahhari emphasizes that the Imams (a) did not coin the term, \"usul al-din\", and says: it was coined by scholars in order to indicate the main goals of the religion, for there are many other beliefs in Islam in which a Muslim has to believe, such as the belief in angels and the essentials of the religion , such as prayer and fasting . In the past, no particular criterion was specified for when beliefs count as the principles of a religion or a religious denomination. The significance of an issue in a certain period usually led to its consideration as a principle, such as the problem of Divine Justice that has no privilege over other Divine Attributes , but because of major disagreements between the Shi'a and the Mu'tazila, on the one hand, and the Ash'aris —who constituted the majority of Sunni Muslims— on the other hand, it came to be considered as a principle of the religion for the Shi'a and the Mu'tazila. Principles of a Religious Denomination In addition to the principles of the religion shared by various Islamic denominations, every Islamic denomination involves its own fundamental beliefs that are called the \"principles of the denomination\". For example, Imami Shi'as believe, in addition to the above three principles, in two additional principles: justice and imamate . Therefore, the principles of the Shiite denomination are five. Issues, such as enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong and justice, count as principles of the Mu'tazila denomination. Background The term, \"usul al-din,\" was not used in the Qur'an and hadiths , and was coined by Muslims. It is conjectured that the use of the term, \"al-usul al-khamsa\" (the five principles), by Abu l-Hudhayl al-'Allaf , a Mu'tazili theologian, paved the ground for the use of the word, \"usul al-din\". Since Ibn al-Nadim has attributed a book with the title, \"usul al-din\", to Abu Musa Murdar, some people think that the term was common in early 3rd/9th century. However, in some hadiths from the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) , some religious elements were introduced as tenets of the religion. For example, Sunni Muslims have transmitted a hadith from the Prophet (s) to the effect that Islam is founded on five elements: monotheism, the prophethood of Muhammad (s), the saying of the prayer , paying the zakat , hajj , and fasting in the month of Ramadan . In al-Kafi , Kulayni has narrated a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) that Islam has been built upon five elements: prayer, zakat, fasting, hajj and wilaya and wilaya is superior to other elements. Moreover, in response to a question about things without which faith is not accepted, Imam al-Sadiq (a) mentioned testifying to the oneness of God, belief in the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (a) and what he has brought from God, belief in zakat and accepting the wilaya of Ahl al-Bayt (a). In this hadith, the narrator has referred to these elements as the pillars of Islam. Requirement of Certainty The majority of scholars require certainty with respect to the principles of the religion. In his book, al-Bab al-hadi 'ashar , al-'Allama al-Hilli claimed that scholars had consensus over this requirement, but al-Shaykh al-Ansari cited other views in this regard as well, such as the view according to which it is sufficient to presume, or have probabilistic knowledge (zann) of, the principles of the religion. According to al-Shaykh al-Ansari, it is implied by what is quoted from al-Muhaqqiq al-Ardabili and his student, Sahib al-Madarik , as well as by the writings of al-Shaykh al-Baha'i , al-'Allama al-Majlisi , and Fayd Kashani , that if a person merely presumes the principles of the religion, then he or she counts as a Muslim. Al-Shaykh al-Ansari himself holds, in his al-Rasa'il , that the mere presumption of the principles of the religion is not sufficient for counting as a believer, and that given many hadiths implying the requirement of knowledge, one is obliged to inquire about such principles in order to achieve certainty, if possible. According to al-Shaykh al-Ansari, a person who has not achieved certainty is not a believer, because according to hadiths, knowledge is required for faith. However, such a person does not count as an unbeliever either, because there are many hadiths implying that some Muslims are neither believers, nor unbelievers. Taqlid According to al-Shahid al-Thani in Haqa'iq al-iman , almost all Muslim scholars believe that it is not permissible to follow other people in the principles of the religion, because the belief in such principles should be with certainty, but following other people does not provide one with certainty. Al-Shaykh al-Ansari has reported that the majority of scholars believe that it is obligatory to inquire about and argue for the principles of the religion. However, there are other views here as well. For example, some scholars hold that taqlid or following other people with respect to the principles of the religion is permissible if it yields knowledge. Al-Shaykh al-Ansari himself believes that taqlid in Islamic principles is permissible, because what is required for faith by hadiths is knowledge, and not inquiry. Moreover, because of many doubts about the principles of the belief, one cannot obtain certainty even after a great deal of inquiry. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi also believes that a person who cannot personally inquire about the principles of the religion can follow a scholar in this regard. Today, the first issue that appears in books of tawdih al-masa'il (or manuals of Islamic laws) is taqlid in the principles of the religion. According to the fatwas of marja's , a Muslim should believe in the principles of the religion with certainty and on the basis of arguments. However, some marja's, such as Sayyid Muhammad Rida Gulpayigani , Sayyid 'Ali Sistani , and Lutf Allah Safi Gulpayigani , have added that if one obtains certainty in the principles of the religion, even without any arguments or reasoning, then they count as Muslims.

{"title": "Al-Sirat", "text": " Al-Ṣirāṭ (Arabic: اَلصِّراط ) is a bridge over the Hell that all people should cross on the Day of Resurrection . According to Islamic sources, this passage has some stations in which one's beliefs and deeds are evaluated. Due to their performance in this world, some people cross the bridge faster than others, and some people will stay there for thousands of years, and some of them will fall from the bridge to the Hell. The belief in Sirat is one of the basic tenets of Islam. Lexicology In the Holy Qur'an , the words \"ṣirāṭ\", \"ṭarīq\" (Arabic: اَلطَّریق ) and \"sabīl\" (Arabic: اَلسَّبیل ) are very close in meaning: they all mean the path or the way. According to al-Raghib al-Isfahani , the difference between these three words is as follows: \"sirat\" is a main way or an obvious path, \"sabil\" is an easy, smooth way, and \"tariq\" is a way that can only be traveled on foot. Nature According to 'Allama Tihrani , sirat is a metaphor for the closest internal path to knowing God. He maintains that every person has in oneself paths to knowing God. This is embodied in the resurrection as a bridge to the Heaven. He holds that the Infallibles (a) have traveled the closest and the fastest way to God, and this is why their way of knowledge is called \"al-ṣirāṭ al-mustaqīm\" (Arabic: اَلصِّراطَ المُستَقیم ) (the right path); a path that is sharper than a sword and narrower than a hair string. In the Holy Qur'an The word \"sirat\" occurred 45 times in different verses of the Holy Qur'an, all in its singular form. And in 32 of these verses, the word is modified with the adjective \"mustaqim\" (right or straight). In exegetical books, the word is discussed mostly under the Holy Qur'an 1:6: “ Guide us to the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim) ” According to hadiths , the belief in sirat is a basic Shiite belief. Al-Sirat al-Mustaqim (the Straight Path) In many cases, sirat is characterized in the Holy Qur'an by the adjective \"mustaqim\" (straight). In an interpretation of the well-known quote, \"the paths to God are as many as people's souls\", 'Allama Tihrani says that although there are many ways to God, the straight path (al-sirat al-mustaqim) is the only and the best path of closeness to God. Those different paths can take people to God insofar as they are close to the straight path. Here are some instances of the straight path in the Holy Qur'an and hadiths: A path that leads to knowing God The Prophet (s) Amir al-Mu'minin (a) Infallible Imams (a) God's religion Worshiping God Relation with God. Given that there is only one straight path, Imam Khomeini writes that all the above are instances of one and the same path. The application of the straight path to humanity, its leader (the Prophet (s) and Imams (a)), the religion, and the bridge on the Hell is compatible with there being only one such path, since they are all paths to the Heaven and to God. Features According to hadiths from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , sirat is a bridge over the Hell which is sharper than a sword and narrower than a hair string. The Hell mediates between people and the Heaven; all people should cross the bridge. Some of them cross it as fast as light, some cross as fast as a horse, and some crawl on it, and some cross it with a lot of difficulty while hanging from it, with fire on parts of their bodies. Some scholars assimilated the narrowness of sirat to Imam 'Ali (a) 's lifestyle that was very cautious with his painstaking attitude to comply with divine orders. Some hadiths that take Imam 'Ali (a) as an instance of sirat support such an analogy. It is not known whether sirat passes through the Hell or is placed over it. Stations One difficulty of the sirat is that there are stations ('aqaba), or checkpoints, so to speak, on it. According to al-Shaykh al-Saduq , these stations are obligations and prohibitions that have to be observed in this world. Each of the stations is called after one of these obligations and prohibitions. If one failed to comply with any of these in this world, then he or she will be questioned for thousands of years, and if one complied with it in this world, then he or she will pass it fast to the next station, and so on to the Heaven. Here are some important stations of sirat: The wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) Honesty and family ties Helping the oppressed people Saying prayers How one has earned money and how one has spent it Khums Zakat Hajj and 'umra Fasting Factors that help one to keep on the sirat According to Quranic verses and hadiths, there are things that help one not fall from the sirat to the Hell: Hoping divine mercy Reciting salawat Wilaya of Ahl al-Bayt (a) Loving Ahl al-Bayt (a) Visiting Ahl al-Bayt (a) Having perfect wudu Taking care of the five daily prayers Continuous attendance of congregational prayers Saying night prayers Helping a believer Lending money to a Muslim brother Removing the worries of a Muslim brother Paying sadaqa , especially in Laylat al-Qadr 10 days of fasting in the month of Rajab 26 days of fasting in the month of Sha'ban Istighfar in the month of Sha'ban Vigilance in the 23rd night of the Ramadan month, and saying 100 rak'as of prayers in that night Taking care of a patient Intercession for people's affairs Being ashamed before God Being content to the divine fate First People Who Cross the Sirat According to hadiths, the Holy Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) are the first people who cross the sirat.

{"title": "Dajjal", "text": "Dajjāl (Arabic: دَجَّال ) is a person or being which in some narrations has been considered among the greatest enemies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It is mentioned in narrations that Dajjal appears at the time of hardship and famine. He will deceive and attract a group to himself, but finally will be destroyed by Imam (a). According to Shiite hadiths , Dajjal's riot is a sign of the Reappearance of the Twelfth Shiite Imam. Lexical Meaning \"Dajjal\" comes from the root form \"Dal Jim Lam\" (Arabic: دال جیم لام ) meaning \"very deceiving\". The word \"Dajjal\" in Hebrew teachings means \"enemy of God\" constituting from \"Dajj\" meaning \"enemy\" and \"al\" meaning \"God\". (In Hebrew, \"al\" and \"il\" mean God, e.g. Israel means friend of God, or as Jewish interpret triumphant with God, who prevails with God!). In Muslim Sources In Sunni Sources Most of the narrations regarding Dajjal have been narrated by Ahmad b. Hanbal in Musnad , al-Tirmidhi in his Jami' , Ibn Majah in his Sunan , Muslim in his Sahih , and by Ibn Athir in al-Nihaya from Abd Allah b. Umar and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Jabir b. Abd Allah al-Ansari . In Sunni hadiths, the riot of Dajjal is taken as a sign of the Day of Judgment . In Shia Sources In Shiite books of hadiths, there are only few hadiths to the effect that the riot of Dajjal is a sign of the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) along with the Heavenly Cry , the riot of Sufyani , and the riot of Yamani . These hadiths are not regarded as reliable . There are mentions that he will be killed by Imam (a) or in another narration by Jesus Christ (a) . In these narrations, there is no mention of the issues suggested in Sunni narrations such as Dajjal's mischiefs, his appearance, his followers, etc. According to a narration by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq from the Prophet (s) , mention of Dajjal has been in the past but his presence will be in future. According to hadiths, Dajjal appears at a time of hardship and starvation, deceives a group of people, and gathers them around himself. If we assume the story of Dajjal as true, undoubtedly many of the characteristics mentioned for him would seem legendary. Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi narrated a hadith from the Prophet (s) through Sunni sources saying, \"No prophet was ever assigned to mission unless he alarmed his people about the mischief of Dajjal.\" According to the lexical meaning of Dajjal, it seems that it would not refer to a certain person, but anyone having invalid claims trying to deceive people might be Dajjal. In this regard, existence of several Dajjals can be justified who may have emerged in different periods and have tried to make mischief and deceive people having weak faith . Existence of hadiths in which several Dajjals are mentioned supports this assumption including a hadith from the Prophet (s), \"Before coming of the Dajjal, more than seventy Dajjals will come.\" Therefore, the issue of Dajjal suggests that on the verge of the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , a deceiving person would do all he can to keep the culture and system of ignorance in order to make people doubtful about the truth and accomplishment of Imam's (a) uprising and his leadership. About Dajjal, many unfounded assumptions have been proposed, none of which have any clear and definite reference and they are only based on possibilities. In the New Testament In Hebrew and in Jewish doctrines, the word, \"Dajjal\", means the enemy of God, composed of the word, \"dajj\" (enemy) and \"al\" (God). In the New Testament , it only exists in the letters of John, the Apostle, and those who deny the Christ, the Father, or the Son are called Dajjal. In English translation of holy books of Christianity , \"Anti-Christ\" has been considered as the equivalent for it which is the Greek corresponding word; as we read in the first letter of John, \"Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.\" Also, in this chapter, verses 22 and 23 we read, \"Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist--denying the Father and the Son.\" . Time of Emergence According to some non-certain hadiths, Dajjal begins his riot in Isfahan or Khorasan . It is mentioned in a hadith that when the spoils of the war in Constantinople are being shared, the news of the emergence of Dajjal is given to Imam al-Mahdi (a) and his companions.\" On the verge of the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a), many signs appear one of which is the coming of Dajjal. Characteristics, Beliefs and Thoughts In hadiths (the origin for most of them are Sunni sources), it is mentioned that Dajjal claims to be God and by his existence, a great bloodshed and mischief happens in the world. It can be learned from the reports that his right eye is sealed and his left eye is in the middle of his forehead and illuminates and that there is a blood clot is in his eye. He is large, powerful, weird looking and very skillful in magic. There is a black mountain in front of him which seems to people that it is a mountain of bread and there is a white mountain behind him which seems to people as flowing pure water. He shouts, \"My servants! I am your great Lord.\" Dajjal passes everywhere but he does not go to Mecca , Medina , and Jerusalem al-Quds . Most of his followers are adulterine Jews and Bedouin Arabs who have crowns on their heads. It is mentioned in these reports that about Dajjal, the Prophet (s) said, \"Every believer who sees Dajjal, will spit on his face and recites the Sura al-Fatiha (Qur'an 1) to dispel that cursed one's magic.\" According to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , in a lengthy speech, Imam Ali (a) said, \"Imam al-Mahdi (a) will go from Mecca to Jerusalem al-Quds with his companions and there war happened between Imam (a) and Dajjal and his army; and Dajjal and his army will be defeated so that the first to the last of them will be killed and then the world will thrive.\" Eventually, According to hadiths, Dajjal will be hung and executed by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in Kufa or a place beside the gate of Lad near Jerusalem al-Quds. On another hadith, Dajjal will be killed in Syria .

{"title": "Bodily Resurrection", "text": " Bodily resurrection (Arabic: المعاد الجسماني , al-Ma'ād al-Jismānī) is an Islamic doctrine according to which a human being will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment (Qiyama) with both of his or her body and soul . This is a belief over which all Muslims have consensus , though there are disagreements about its features and qualities. According to a popular view among scholars of theology , the very physical body in this world will be resurrected on Dooms Day. To support their view, they appeal to Qur'anic verses and hadiths . Islamic philosophers have different views about bodily resurrection, from a philosophical denial of the phenomenon to a version of bodily resurrection according to which human beings will be resurrected with bodies different from their material or physical bodies in this world, such as Mithali (analogical) or Hurqalya's bodies. According to Islamic philosophers, it is intellectually compromised to believe the apparent implications of the Qur'anic verses and hadiths. In order to solve the disagreement between the view of philosophers and the apparent implications of the Qur'an and hadiths, Mulla Sadra has propounded the theory of bodily resurrection with Mithali bodies. Notion The word \"Ma'ad\" (Arabic: المعاد ) literally means return or where people return to. In the terminology of the scholars of theology , the word means resurrection—the return of the dead to life in the afterlife —which is of two sorts: bodily (Arabic: جسمانی , Jismani), and spiritual (Arabic: روحانی , Ruhani). In this approach, the doctrine of the bodily resurrection is essential to Islam, the denial of which leads to infidelity. According to this doctrine, human beings are composed of a soul and a body. When their this-worldly life ends, they go to the world of Barzakh . When the Dooms Day arrives, they go back to life with both of their bodies and souls, and they go to God for an evaluation of their actions in this world. If they were righteous during their mundane lives, they will be rewarded by heaven , and if they were wrong-doers, they will be punished by the hell . Theories Different theories have been proposed about the bodily resurrection. Some people deny the doctrine, and some people have accepted it. Proponents of the doctrine differ, in turn, over what bodily resurrection will be like. Here is an outline of such theories: The return of the very mundane material body : scholars of theology have appealed to the apparent implications of the Qur'anic verses and hadiths to show that on Dooms Day, the very body one had during his or her life in this world or something like it will be resurrected together with his or her soul. The conjunction of the soul with a Mithali body : in order to reconcile evidence from the Qur'an and hadith with philosophical principles, Mulla Sadra presented a new theory about bodily resurrection. According to this theory, after its separation from the material body, the human soul will create a body for itself which is congenial to the worlds of Barzakh and Qiyama and is nonetheless qualitatively similar or indistinguishable from its this-worldly or mundane body. The Mithali body is not identical with the mundane body, rather it is just qualitatively similar to it, and while it has material features (such as shape and size), it is not material (it has no matter—no mass or volume). The return of the elemental body to the immaterial soul : some proponents of the Transcendent Philosophy of Mulla Sadra , such as Aqa Ali Zunuzi , maintain that, unlike what Mulla Sadra thinks, the body is not created in the afterlife by the soul. Instead, the mundane body (the one we have in this world) continues its development and perfection after its separation from the immaterial soul. This substantial motion continues to the point where the body is so developed that it can be conjoined with the immaterial soul once again. Therefore, in the afterlife, it is not the soul that returns to the body; rather it is the body that develops towards to the soul and returns to it. Bodily resurrection with a developed elemental body : other proponents of the Transcendent Philosophy, such as Sayyid Abu l-Hassan al-Rafi'i al-Qazwini , take Mulla Sadra's view to be in direct contradiction with the apparent implications of Qur'anic verses and hadiths . According to his own view, the human soul attaches to a Mithali body after its separation from the material body. And when the elements of the material body undergo a natural evolution and are capable of appearing in the afterlife, the bodily resurrection occurs. The afterlife body is created by the earth and mundane materials, and it can be adapted to the afterlife through a gradual development, so that it can be attached to the immaterial soul. Resurrection with a Hurqaliyati body : according to the view propounded by Ahmad b. Zayn al-din b. Ibrahim al-Ahsa'i , the founder of Shaykhiyya sect, human beings have two physical bodies. The first one is the mundane body they have in this world, which will turn into earth after death and will be destroyed. The second one is not visible; it is the \"Tinat\" (nature or innate) that survives the destruction of human bodies in graves. At the time of death, the soul is separated from the first body, but the second body survives and attaches to the soul in the afterlife. The resurrection will occur with this latter body, and it is the body with which people go to heaven or hell . Origin of Controversies Some disagreements about the bodily resurrection have their origin in some objections to the doctrine. Some people accept these objections, believing that the material, elemental body does not return to existence after the death, but some people try to counter the objection in different ways. Some evidence for the doctrine of the bodily resurrection are intellectual or philosophical, and some are from the tradition of Qur'anic verses and hadiths. And some objections to the bodily resurrection include: the impossibility of repetition of nothingness (or I'ada al-Ma'dum), the Eater and the Eaten objection , and the impossibility of metempsychosis (or Tanasukh ). The second origin of controversies are the different views concerning the nature of human beings. Thus people, such as Islamic philosophers, who believe that human beings have immaterial souls, accept only the spiritual resurrection. Some people who deny the immaterial soul, such as scholars of theology, subscribe only to the bodily resurrection, and some people, such as atheists (who take the human beings to be identical to its body), deny both the bodily and the spiritual resurrections. Qur'anic Verses There are three verses of the Qur'an regarding cases of reviving the dead which might be appealed to in favor of the bodily resurrection: The story of the prophet, 'Uzayr (a) (Ezra), or Irmiya (a) (Jeremiah) the prophet, The revival of birds by Prophet Ibrahim (a) , The revival of a person from Israelites . These cases might show the possibility of the bodily resurrection. Moreover, there are some Qur'anic verses referring to the dead coming out of their graves in the resurrection, such as verses 24 and 25 of Qur'an 7 and verses 66-68 of Qur'an 19 , as well as verse 7 of Qur'an 22 . Quality In order to explain the bodily resurrection in terms of the Qur'anic verses and hadiths, there are some points to be taken account of: According to the apparent implications of such textual evidence, the elemental, material body returns with its main parts. The afterlife and the mundane bodies are exact, indistinguishable duplicates, rather than being identical. According to hadiths , whatever turns into earth or whatever is eaten by animals will not be missed in divine knowledge. All the earths (to which human bodies have turned) will be reassembled and by the leave of God, it will go where the soul is, regaining its previous human shape and form, and finally attaching to the soul. According to some other hadiths, though people's bones and flesh turn into earth, their Tinat (the nature) or the main parts from which the person was created will survive. These parts that can never be destroyed will regain their previous shape in the afterlife.

{"title": "End Time", "text": " End Time or Akhir al-Zamān (Arabic: آخر الزمان ) is a religious title referring to the final period of the world which has been mentioned in all divine religions. In Islam , it has been mentioned either referring to a period of time related with the mission of the Prophet (s) , or referring to the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi . In common beliefs, End Time is known with extraordinary happenings. The most important characteristics of this period are the decline in people's religious practice and then the coming of a savior . The exact date of coming of the savior of the End Time is unknown and can only be determined with the ending period of time, which continues up to the Apocalypse and the end of the world. In the Qur'an The title \"Akhir al-Zaman\" ( آخر الزّمان ; End Time) is not mentioned in the Qur'an , but there are verses which are about the future of human society and suggest the government of monotheism and justice in the future of human life, inheriting the earth by righteous people and victory of the truth over falsehood. In Hadiths The expression of Akhir al-Zaman has been used in hadiths in two meanings: The Time of the Prophet (s) The time beginning with the mission of the Prophet (s) until the Resurrection . In some hadiths, the Prophet (s) has been referred to as the Prophet (s) of the End Time. Such a description is related to the fact that the Prophet (s) was the Last of the Prophets (s), and his religion is valid until the end of the time due to its perfection, and he (s) is the Prophet (s) of the last part of the time on earth. The Time of the Coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a) In many hadiths, End Time refers to the time when the Savior (the Promised Mahdi) comes and the certain occurrences happening at three different times: Difficult trials of the End Time including the Battle of Kirkisia [5] Coming of the Savior and the battle between the truth and the falsehood [6] Victory of the truth over falsehood and the golden age of the world [7] Determining its Time The exact time for these signs has not been mentioned in hadiths and even determining the exact time for them has been rejected. No one knows the exact time of coming of the Savior other than God and it is one of the issues of the Unseen . Imam al-Rida (a) quoted from the Prophet (s) that the time of the uprising of the Promised Mahdi (a) is like the Day of Judgment which no one knows of its time other than God and will happen all of a sudden. Signs The signs mentioned for this age in Islamic hadiths are known as the signs of the End Time. Thus the coming of the Promised Mahdi (a) has been likened to the Resurrection because the same way the Resurrection has various signs ( Ashrat al-Sa'a ), the coming of the Promised Mahdi (a) has signs which happen before it. In some books, these signs have been called as Signs of the Reappearance ('Ala'im al-Zuhur) as one of the most significant happenings of this age is the coming of the Savior. Some of these signs are: Emergence of Sufyani [12] Emergence of Sayyid al-Hasani , dispute among descendants of Abbasids over kingdom [13] Eclipse of the sun in the middle of the month of Ramadan and the eclipse of the moon at the end of it [14] Rising the Sun from the west [15] Murdering al-Nafs al-Zakiyya (the Purified Soul) [16] Destruction of Kufa mosque , Emergence of Yamani , the permissibility of shedding the blood of people and taking their property [17] Emergence of Anti-Christ (Dajjal) [18] about which it is mentioned in hadiths that he will stay for forty days after emergence [19] and many people having weak faith will turn to him and this is because of extraordinary thing he will do. [20] Emergence of wars, massacres, and obliteration of the proofs of the truth [21] Emergence of great corruptions in the world [22] Escalation of chaos and weakening of people's faith [23] Taking the positions of the management of the society by incompetent people, the obedience of men from their wives, overvaluation of the world, lack of security [24] Emergence of different mischief and trials among Arabs [25] Disappearance of modesty among women and children [26] Prevalence of usury [27] Occurrence of great massacres in the world and emergence of trials [28] Men's needlessness of women and women's needlessness of men [29] Drinking alcoholic drinks and wearing silk [30] Differences with the Signs of the Apocalypse In the Qur'an and hadiths, there is another similar term called \" Ashrat al-Sa'a \" (signs of the moment) which refers to events happening of which is a sign of approaching the Apocalypse. In many Sunni sources and some Shia hadith collections , the signs of the coming Imam al-Mahdi (a) are mixed with the signs of approaching the Apocalypse, and even sometimes the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a) itself is mentioned as a sign of the Apocalypse. Generally, authors of Sunni hadith collections have assigned a section called Ashtrat al-Sa'a and even with the content of these hadiths is so much common with the hadiths about the End Time. Many of the signs have been mentioned in both groups of hadiths. Still, the issue of the End Time has always been clearly distinguished from the Apocalypse because the End Time refers to the last age in this world, but Ashrat al-Sa'a are the signs before the Resurrection. After the Coming of the Savior After the emergence of these signs, the coming of the Savior will happen, which is among the most important events of the End Time. From the most important events after the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a), some facts can be mentioned: Fighting oppression and corruption and eradicating them [36] Saving humanity from dilemmas of sins , oppression, and corruption is among the Savior's goals which will be fulfilled at his time as Imam Ali (a) says, \"at the time of the al-Mahdi's (a) rule, the issues of adultery , drinking [alcoholic drinks] and usury will be eradicated.\" [37] Establishment of true Islam and worshiping God and monotheism in the whole world [38] Prevalence of religion [39] Acting upon religious values and merits and precise observation of religious orders and rulings [40] Establishment of security, so that the life, property, and honor of people in the society will be safe from others' violation [41] and through the Savior, routes will gain security. [42] Establishment of welfare for all people [43] so that all edible things will be accessible by human beings and people would easily use properties. [44] Development of cities in all the world [45] Development of friendship, kindness, and friendliness among all people, so that people would take as much as they need from their religious brothers' reserves without any problem. [46] Perfection of intellects and human's readiness for benefiting from divine teachings. [47] Perfection and developments in science and knowledge in all aspects and benefiting from the perfect scientific fruits by all people in the society [48] Acting upon the Book of God and the conduct of the Prophet (s) [49] These are among the events happening at the time of the Savior and are considered among the characteristics of this age. Coming of Jesus (a) According to hadiths, one of the important happenings of the time of the coming of the Savior is the coming of Prophet Jesus (a) from skies. From these hadiths, it can be learned that the Prophet Jesus (a) will participate in the world uprising of the End Time and comes from the skies to establish justice but under the flag of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and would not be independent. Jesus (a) will come down on the land of Palestine and will greet Imam al-Mahdi (a) and will pray behind him and help him in killing Anti-Christ (Dajjal). Raj'a Raj'a (the return) is among other important events in the golden age of the world after the coming of the Savior and his actions. Raj'a refers to the return to life of given past historical figures, from some righteous and some bad people, after their physical death. In Other Religions The concept of the End Time has been mentioned in other religions in other forms as well. In Christianity Meaning Christians speak of a time when the return of Jesus (a) will happen. Coming of Messiah (a) has been mentioned in the Bible more than three hundred times and some complete chapters are about that. Jesus (a) will come again in the End Time and complete the program to rescue people. They believe that the world will meet happiness in his coming and will be in complete peace after his coming. War and bloodshed will be gone and no group will then fight another. The belief about the victory of the truth over falsehood is evident in Christian culture and the Bible and in their views, the Savior is Messiah(a). Signs For the coming of Messiah who is Jesus (a), some signs have been mentioned as following: Messiah will come when people are sinful and oppression has taken over the world. [59] \"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\" [60] \"Shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.\" [61] According to the Bible, the emergence of Anti-Christ (Dajjal) is among the events before coming the Messiah. In Judaism Meaning In Judaism , \"the last days\" or \"the Day of Yahweh (the Lord)\" have been mentioned in many cases, referring to the time when the glory of Jews will reach its peak and sinners will perish and a king of Jesse's (David's father) descent upon whom the spirit of God is and is wise and God-wary will come and will fill the world with justice, goodness and blessings , as then \"the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the young goat.\" The Day of the Lord is when the course of history will reach its peak and perfection. Events before the Coming of Mashiach: There will be bloody wars at the time of the coming of Messiah due to political unrest. As it has been said that, \"whenever you see that governments engage in war with each other, expect the steps of Mashiach, because at the time of Prophet Abraham (a) it happened so and when the states engaged in war with each other, Abraham (a) came to save.\" Coming of Mashiach will be together with great difficulties. Before his coming chaos and corruption in the world will reach their peak and life's difficulties will be almost unbearable. These conflicts and wars among states of the world are called wars of Gog and Magog . Events after Coming of Mashiach The happenings of the time of Mashiach are: Cure of the sick [69] Trees bearing abundant fruits [70] Reconstruction of the ruins [71] Reconstruction of Jerusalem al-Quds [72] Establishment of peace throughout the nature [73] Disappearing crying in the world [74] Disappearing death in the world [75] In Zoroastrianism In Zoroastrianism , the coming of a savior at the End Time has been mentioned as well. In Zoroastrianism, this issue has been mentioned in a certain way according to their beliefs. They believe that a cosmological power or \"spirit of good\" called Ahura Mazda and an opposite cosmological power or great spirit of evil called Ahriman exist. During history, these two powers fight each other until the End Time when the good defeat the evil and a period of peace, purity, and promotion of Ahura Mazda will come and with the coming Saoshyant , the End Time comes. In one of the clauses of Gathas, which are the compositions of Zarathusthra (Zoroaster), there is a mention of a man who will come in the future and find the way of saving. Also in Gatha, in some places, the name Saoshyant has been mentioned who is the savior in Zoroastrianism. The term Frashokereti (final renovation of the universe) is another term mentioned in Gatha and refers to the End Time, when after weakness and then the destruction of Ahriman and its forces, the universe returns to its original perfection (Gatha Yasna Vahat). Thus, Saoshyant is the person who will come at the end of the world and is called the victor Saoshyant and also astvat-әrәta (from whose life, all humans become immortal). In Avesta, the word Saoshyant has been mentioned at least eight times and astvat-әrәta at least twice. Events after the Coming of Saoshyant One of the actions of this promised savior after his coming is the renovation of the universe and eradication of evil and darkness. The companions of this promised savior have been described as thinking good, speaking good, doing good and having good religion, and never tell lies.

{"title": "Heavenly Cry", "text": "Heavenly Cry (Arabic: الصيحة ) is among the signs before the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . This call is made by Gabriel and will be heard from the sky. The message in this call has been mentioned in different ways: giving glad news about the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), his description, and the rightfulness of Shi'a . At the end of the same day, Satan will try to make doubts in people using a similar call. Hadiths regarding the Heavenly Cry are mutawatir , but they have mentioned different times for it. A Sign for the Reappearance Hearing the miraculous Heavenly Cry has been regarded among the signs of the reappearance or uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a). This call will be made by Gabriel and in Shia and Sunni sources, it has been referred to as \"nida'\" (Arabic: نداء ) [call], \"sayha\" (Arabic: صیحة ) [scream] and \"sawt\" (Arabic: صوت ) [sound] among which, \"nida'\" has been more frequent in hadiths. In Arabic, \"nida'\" means \"to raise and show a voice\" and \"sayha\" means \"a loud sound or cry\". Although in many hadiths, \"sayha\" has been referring to \"nida'\" but in some, they have been regarded as two different phenomenon. Certainty According to al-Shaykh al-Saduq 's narration from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , this sign beside four other signs ( uprising of al-Sufyani , uprising of al-Yamani , al-Khasf bi-l-Bayda' , and murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya ) is among the certain signs preceding the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . In another hadith , the first of these signs has been mentioned to be this Heavenly Cry in the month of Ramadan . Imam Ali (a) said, \"Expect the Reappearance in three conditions\". Someone asked, \"what are those signs?\" Imam (a) answered, \"the conflicts among the people of Syria ; black flags coming from Khorasan , and the Call in the month of Ramadan.\" Coverage This call made by Gabriel will be heard by all people, so that anyone will hear it in his own language. Most hadiths have mentioned sky as the place of broadcasting this call. One of its attributes is that it will be heard equally from near and far; it will wake up the asleep and scares people; it will bring the faithful mercy and will bring disbelievers pain and from then, the name of Imam al-Mahdi (a) will be distributed among people. Time Narrations about the time of the Heavenly Cry are different and have caused different reactions among scholars. Before the Reappearance According to the views of most scholars, Heavenly Cry will happen in Ramadan of the year before the Reappearance. Their justification is a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) who said, \"That call will not rise other than in the month of Ramadan; … A caller from sky will mentioned the name of al-Qa'im (a) and anyone in east and the west will hear it.\" Upon the Reappearance Form some hadiths, it can be understood that the Heavenly Cry will happen upon the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). In these narrations, the happening of the Heavenly Cry coincides with the uprising of Imam (a). Al-Shaykh al-Mufid has mentioned this coincidence in a hadith from the Prophet (s) . \"When the uprising of the Upriser approaches, a caller from sky will call, 'O people! The time of oppressors has come to end and one who is responsible to make it done is the best of the people of Muhammad (s), so take yourself to Mecca .'\" According to another hadith, toward the Reappearance, in the month of Ramadan , and in some other in the month of Rajab Gabriel will call the name of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the name of his father and says, \"Behold that the Proof of God (hujjat Allah) appeared beside the House of God . Obey him, for truth is with him and in him. He is the Upriser of the family of Muhammad (s); the best of his people; your commander and ruler. This is al-Mahdi (a) who will judge in the manner of David (a) and Solomon (a) and would not ask for witness and testimony. So what is all the war and bloodshed for? Listen to him and follow his orders. Know that the right belongs to Ali (a), the family of the Prophet (s) and their followers. Ali (a) and his followers are the saved ones. O people of the world! The time of oppressors has come to the end.\" After the Reappearance and before the Uprising Some have regarded the time of Reappearance and the time of uprising to be different from each other. They believe that Heavenly Cries are after the Reappearance and before the uprising and that Heavenly Cries will be several from the Reappearance until the uprising. Mentioning different times for the Heavenly Cry in narrations in some ways support this possibility. Message In most narrations, the message of this call has been said to be introducing Imam al-Mahdi (a) with his name and attributes. Also, in some narrations, the message of this call has been mentioned to be declaration of the rightfulness of Imam Ali (a) and the salvation of his followers. Call of Satan Beside narrations related with the Heavenly Cry, some narrations suggest that toward the end of the same day, Satan will also make a call, the purpose of which is making doubts in people for following Imam al-Mahdi (a), \"Behold that the right is with 'Uthman b. 'Affan and his followers. He was killed being oppressed; so, rise to his revenge and know that rights belong to al-Sufyani and his followers and 'Uthman and his followers will be salvaged.\" With this call, some will become doubtful. In other narrations, the message of Satan's call has been said to be inviting people to Christianity. Some believe that Satan will also make some calls and each time tries to mislead people. They have deemed it possible that makers of these call would be people who do it following Satan's deception. Novel Interpretations Regardless of the many narrations, some writers have tried to interpret this sign in agreement with new technologies and today advances in sciences as satellites. This justification has not been approved by religious scholars due to lack of its evidences.

{"title": "Hell", "text": "Hell or Jahannam (Arabic: جَهنَّم ) is a place in the afterlife in which evil-doers will be punished . The place or parts of it are referred to in the Qur'an also as \" Jaḥīm \" ( الجَحیم ), \"Saqar\" ( السقَر ), \"Sa'īr\" ( السعیر ), and in many cases, it is referred to as \"al-Nar\" ( النار , the Fire). The Hell is not only mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths ; it is also discussed in Islamic disciplines such as theology , philosophy , and theoretical mysticism . Lexicology The word, \"Jahannam\", literally means a very deep pit. It refers to a fire with which God will punish the sinners in the afterlife . In the terminology of the Qur'an, it refers to the location of afterlife punishments where evil-doers and unbelievers will be punished. Most Muslim lexicographers take \"Jahannam\" to have a non-Arabic root, while some of them take it to have an Arabic origin. Isma'il b. Hammad al-Jawhari and al-Raghib al-Isfahani take it to be a persian word. Al-Raghib takes the original form of \"Jahannam\" to be \"Jahannām\" ( جَهَنّام , a Persian word which means a deep pit). Ibn Athir, Ibn Manzur, and al-Suyuti speculate that the word has a Hebrew origin; they hold that it is derived from the Hebrew word, \"Kihinnām\". Contemporary western researchers take the word to be originated from the Hebrew word, \"Gehennom\" (גיהנום), or \"Jihinum\" which means the valley of Banu Hinum. Hell in Eschatology In eschatology, the Hell is taken to be the worst place as opposed to the Heaven which is taken to be the best place. The Heaven is home to all the good, and the Hell is home to all the sufferings. Agents of the Hell All agents of the Hell are angels and servants who absolutely obey God . In the Islamic doctrine, there is no Hell the control of which is in the hands of devils. The Hell is totally ruled and controlled by God. According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Hell is a torture for the sinners and is a mercy for its agents who work inside it. The main guard of the Hell who is called \"Malik\" ( مالك ) is characterized in hadiths as being very ugly and stinky. The 19 guards of the Hell to which the Qur'an refers are characterized as being so frightening that if an earthly person looked at them, he or she would die immediately. The Philosophy of the Hell The main question concerning the Hell is why evil-doers should endure such a hard and long punishment which is not comparable to hardships of this world with respect to its strength and eternity. Guarantee for religious ruling The fear of the Hell is taken by religious doctrines to be a performance bond for religious rulings. The Qur'an has asked people to fear the Hell and protect themselves and their family from its fire. Punishment for actions Several Qur'anic verses consider the Hell to be a \"punishment\" for one's evil actions. In addition to frequent terms that imply punishment, the term, \"nakal\" ( نَکال , reprisal) is also used, and God has been even characterized as being \"muntaqim\" ( مُنتَقِم , avenger). Embodiment of actions According to the doctrine of the Embodiment of Actions , the punishment endured by evil-doers is, in fact, the real form of their own actions, and it is the actions themselves which take the forms of punishments and bring sufferings to them. No suffering is imposed on anyone from the outside; rather the punishment is the result of their own actions. The notion of the Embodiment of Actions is implied by some Qur'anic verses; however, it is most obviously stated in Sura al-Zilzal (99):8: \"And anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it\" . In another verse of the Qur'an, usurping the possessions of an orphan is identified with eating the fire. From Death to the Resurrection After his death, the sinner endures sufferings in Barzakh (a world between this world and afterlife) until the resurrection . Then a divine court of justice is held on Dooms Day; those who deserve the Heaven will not suffer from the Hell, and evil-doers will be punished after being tried. However, some Islamic texts talk about immediate transfer to the Hell after death; it is as if the fire of the Hell lurks beyond the death. Such a picture is given about the people of the prophets Noah (a) and Lot (a) ; they were immediately moved to the Hell after they died by a divine punishment in this world. The Hell is said not to wait for evil-doers to go to it; rather it lurks in ambush for them. When evil-doers are about to enter the Hell, its fire flames. And when the divine court of justice is held after the resurrection, the Hell is brought to the scene. On Dooms Day, the Hell is presented to the evil-doers. They will see the Hell and know that they will be thrown into it, feeling the suffering before entering it. The sufferings of the Hell are referred to in the Qur'an as \"'Adhab yawm 'azim\" (the punishment of a tremendous day), \"'Adhab yawm 'aqim\" (the punishment of an inauspicious day), and \"'Adhab yawm kabir\" (the punishment of a great day) as attributed to the day of resurrection. The Hell acts like a hunter: some of its flames go out to capture certain groups of sinners and devour them. The flame is characterized as having two eyes and a fluently talking tongue. Such flames are commissioned to hunt three groups of sinners: obstinate tyrants, those who bothered God and His prophet, and those who make idols. Sometimes the picture is given with more details: there are flames that capture the murderers of Imam al-Husayn (a) , just like a bird that picks seeds from the ground, and take them inside the fire. The Hell is greedy to devour the sinners, and however many evil-doers are thrown inside it, it asks more by saying \"are there any more?\". The Hell lurks in ambush for every person. There is no person present at the day of the resurrection who does not enter it. However, one can find his or her way out of it provided that they have attained salvation. Some hadiths have elaborated this doctrine by talking about a hazardous bridge that goes through the Hell; those who have attained salvation will successfully cross the bridge, and the sinners will fall from it into the Hell. The bridge is characterized as being as narrow as the edge of a sword. Inspired by some Qur'anic verses, the bridge is sometimes called the Sirat . Groups of People Who Enter the Hell In some general statements in religious texts, it is said that many people from human beings and jinn will be punished in the Hell, but in other texts, the instances of people who are punished in the hell are specified with more detail. Polytheism and unbelief : the prime instance of people who are punished in the Hell are polytheists, [40] because polytheism is the biggest sin. [41] Those who take a creature as their god will burn in the fire of the Hell together with what they worshiped. [42] Some rare hadiths have even talked about the sun and the moon being thrown into the Hell, because they were worshiped by some people. [43] Sometimes it is said that unbelievers will be thrown into the Hell, and sometimes obstinate unbelievers are said to enter the Hell. [44] The notion of obstinacy is sometimes cashed out in terms of falsifying the signs of God [45] and ridiculing the divine signs. [46] Arrogance : arrogance is a sin with which many people of the Hell are characterized. [47] In some hadiths, the aspects of such arrogance are delineated. [48] For example, there is a hadith according to which most people in the Hell are arrogant people and tyrants. [49] Brutal rulers: it frequently appears in many hadiths that the first people who enter the Hell are brutal rulers. The theme appears in different Shiite [50] and Sunni [51] sources of hadiths. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) according to which a brutal leader is in the bottom of the Hell and will be punished in the most severe way. [52] Assistants of brutal rulers: people who lean towards brutal rulers [53] and guide them through their brutal acts [54] will be thrown in the Hell along with their bosses. [55] Other descriptions of the people of the Hell refer to the above notion: \"taghi\" ( , disobedient), \"mutrif\" ( , indulged in luxury), and \"musrif\" ( , extravagant). Sinners : one feature of the people of the Hell is that they are sinners and evil-doers, that is, they disobey God and His prophet. [59] The most important sin because of which people go to the Hell is the violation of the rights of people , such as killers of innocent people, [60] faultfinding people, gossipers, [61] and stingy collectors of wealth. [62] In hadiths, other groups of sinners are mentioned over and above the ones mentioned in the Qur'an. [63] The lusts and appetites lead one to the neglect of the horrors of the Hell. [64] Companionship with Sinners: According to some hadiths, people who have committed similar sins will be one another's companions in the Hell. That is, in addition to individual punishments, there is collective punishment as well. The Qur'an frequently talks about nations [65] or groups [66] entering the fire or about people being gathered to the Hell. [67] Although such groups are companions, the Qur'an has mentioned that they talk to each other in a hostile way and express their hate to one another. [68] Dwelling Forever In the initial picture given of the Hell, its dwellers can never go out of it and will be punished there forever. What reinforces this initial picture is that there is no death in the afterlife; dwellers of the Hell will never die, although all conditions that lead to death in this world are present. They do not die, and they never go out of fire. There is a hadith according to which the death is brought to the scene on Dooms Day in the form of a goat—in a way that everyone will recognize it as death—and it is slaughtered, so that people are disappointed from getting rid of their sufferings by death. There are many Qur'anic verses concerning the eternal punishment in the Hell for evil-doers. The Hell is sometimes referred to as \"Dar al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , House of Eternity) and \"'Adhab al-Khuld\" ( عذاب الخلد , Eternal Punishment). According to some People of the Book , those who enter the Hell will only be punished there for a few days and they will then be saved from the fire. However, their belief is strongly reproached in the Qur'an . However, there are few remarks in the Qur'an that led some Muslims to the belief that there are temporary punishments in the Hell as well. Sura al-An'am (6):128 talks about some people dwelling in the Hell forever, but it then qualifies it with the phrase: \"except what God wills\". Thus, some exegetes of the Qur'an maintained that some dwellers of the Hell might find a way out of it one day. There is also a Qur'anic verse according to which sinners \"will dwell therein for ages (ahqab, أحقاب)\" (78:23). This verse has also led some exegetes to believe that the Hell will be a temporary place, at least, for some of its dwellers. According to a hadith , \"I swear to God no one will be saved from the Fire unless they stay there for \"ahqab\" ( أحقاب , ages), each \"haqb\" ( حقب , age) being over 80 years. And if the dwellers of the Hell are told that they would stay there for as many years as all the sands in the world, they would still be delighted\". Dwellers of the Hell who will be saved from the fire after enduring some suffering for their evil actions are considered by some hadiths to be Muslim sinners. According to some hadiths, whoever has a little bit of belief or faith in their heart will be saved from the fire one day. And sometimes people are saved from the Hell by the intercession of some saints of God, while they have turned into ashes in the Hell. Features of the Hell Types of Punishment mentioned in the Qur'an Fire: the most important punishment with which the Hell is known is a burning fire. Some verses of the Qur'an talk about evil-doers falling into the fire, instead of falling into the Hell. However, the Qur'an highlights the peculiarity of this fire by characterizing it as \"burning fire\" or \"lidded fire\" that cooks the skin and leaves nothing. The fire is known as \"Nar Allah\" (the fire of God) and has flaming pillars, and unlike earthly fires, it starts from hearts and it flames outwards, rather than inwards. Its firewood are the human beings themselves. According to some Qur'anic verses, there is a fire that has human beings and stones as its firewood. Fire-related punishments: some punishments in the Hell are related to fire; for instance, \"samum\" ( سموم ) which is fierce blast of fire, and \"hamim\" ( حمیم ) which is boiling water which dwellers of the Hell have to drink, and it will be poured on their heads. Their clothes are also from fire or burning materials such as \"qatiran\" ( قطران , melted tar) and \"hamim\" . Food and drink: the Qur'an and hadiths have mentioned some of what the dwellers of the Hell will eat and drink. Unlike foods and drinks in the Heaven which are characterized with what is familiar to earthly ones, those in the Hell are characterized with unfamiliar terms, such as \"Zaqqum\" ( زقّوم ) which is a kind of tree, \"ghislin\" ( غسلین ) which is taken by the exegetes of the Qur'an to be filth, pus, and corruption from the washing of the wounds, \"dari'\" ( ضریع ) which is thorns or thorny fruit, and drinks such as \"ghassaq\" ( غساق ) which is paralyzing cold water, \"sadid\" ( صدید ) which is fetid or festering water, and \"shurb al-him\" ( شرب الهیم ), which is drinking like a thirsty camel. These terms have been difficult for the exegetes to explain. However, their general feature is that they do not quench thirst or feed up the person, they are stuck in one's throat, and tear up the viscera. Other punishments: there are other punishments in the Hell, such as chains and shackles , iron mace, whips, horrifying sounds in the Hell, tightness of the space, the feeling of pressure, and shadows which are fiercer than the fire. And many more punishments. Types of Punishment Mentioned in the Hadith There are more details in hadiths: for example, there is said to be prisons in the Hell with peculiar punishments, and they are called the prison of Bulas ( بولس ) or Falaq ( فلق ). There are descriptions of snakes and scorpions in the Hell which have been questionable for critics. Some snakes are introduced with their names. Of drinks in the Hell, \"tinat al-khiyal\" (essence of corruption) is mentioned, which is extracted from dwellers of the Hell themselves. There are hadiths about the feeling of disgust by eating and drinking in the Hell. Also, a mill is mentioned which grinds religious scholars who did not practice what they knew. \"Zamharir\", which is a Qur'anic word regarding the Heaven, has been used in hadiths in a different meaning, referring to a land in the Hell with a horrible, freezing cold which tears the bodies of the evil-doers into pieces. According to a hadith, people of the Hell take refuge to Zamharir in order to escape the fire, but they suffer even more in there, and so they beg God to return them to the fire. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, the Qur'anic verse according to which dwellers of the Hell will stay there forever \"except what God wills\" refers to them going to Zamharir for a while during their punishments. Gates and Floors of the Hell The Qur'an frequently points out that the Hell has gates. In one case, it says that the Hell has 7 gates each of which has an \"assigned portion\", that is, they are assigned to different classes of sinners. Some verses also refer to floors and stages of the Hell, for example \"the lowest stage (al-darak al-asfal) of the fire\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have taken \"al-darak al-asfal\" to refer to the lowest stage or floor of the Hell. Some lexicographers and exegetes point out that \"darakat\" with respect to the Hell are counterparts of \"darajat\" (degrees) with respect to the Heaven. However, the word, \"darajat\", has been used about the Hell as well. Some exegetes, such as ibn Jurayh, take the 7 gates to refer to the 7 stages (darakat) of the Hell. This is confirmed in a hadith as well. Some exegetes take the different names for the fires of the Hell to refer to these 7 stages or floors: \"Jahannam\", \"Laza\" ( لظی , flames of the fire), \"Hutama\" ( حطمة , that which crushes and breaks into pieces), \"Sa'ir\" ( سعیر , blazing fire), \"Saqar\" ( سقر , scorching fire), \"Jahim\" ( جحیم , hell fire), and \"Hawiya\" ( هاویة , bottomless pit). However, there is no agreement over their order. There are hadiths that characterize these stages individually; for example, \"Saqar\" is where arrogant people will dwell, and \"Sa'ir\" is where killers will be punished. Other Places of Hell In addition to \"darakat\" (or stages) of the Hell, there are some Qur'anic terms occurring in verses related to the Hell which are taken in some hadiths to refer to specific locations in the Hell. For example, the word, \"Sa'ud\" ( صعود , hard ascent or mount of calamities) in the Qur'an, Sura al-Muddaththir (74):17, is taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, the word, \"'Aqaba\" ( عقبة , height or ascent) is also taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, \"Hufra min al-nar\" (a pit of fire) as a pit in the Hell, \"Falaq\" as a pit in the Hell in which people are punished in different ways, \"Wayl\" as a horrifying valley or a pit in the Hell which it takes 40 years for one to reach its bottom, \"Ghayy\" ( غیّ ) as a valley in the Hell, \"Ghassaq\" ( غساق ) as a river or a valley full of scorpions, \"Atham\" ( اثام ) as a valley in the Hell, and \"Mawbiq\" ( موبق ) as a river of pus and blood in the Hell. There are other locations in the Hell mentioned in hadiths, such as the Pit of Sadness (Huzn, حزن ) from which the Hell itself escapes, the Pit of Habhab ( هبهب ) located in the valley of Saqar in which tyrants dwell, the Sakran ( سکران ) mountain and its valley, Ghadban ( غضبان ), in which there are coffins of fire, and a coffin of fire in the bottom of the Hell in which 6 people from the ancient time and 6 people from the Umma of Prophet Muhammad (s) are punished. Some Imami and Sunni scholars of hadiths have written independent books regarding the Hell and the Heaven, such as Sifat al-janna wa l-nar (Features of the Heaven and the Hell) by Sa'id b. Jinah which is the oldest book in this regard available to us. Humiliation and Deprivation According to Qur'anic doctrines, just as neglectful indulgence in mundane pleasures is punished by deprivation in the Hell, arrogance and tyranny in this world is punished by humiliation in there. From the very beginning, the way evil-doers are thrown into the fire is accompanied by humiliation, as implied by phrases such as \"falling into the fire\" , \"outcast into the fire\", \"being grabbed by the head or by the feet\" and the like. And when they are being punished, they are humiliated by different sufferings; for example, \"'Adhab al-hun\" ( عذاب الهون , humiliating punishment) is a punishment mentioned in the Qur'an for arrogance and tyranny. One manifestation of such humiliation is seen in evil-doers being reproached by the guards of the Hell as well as in a conversation between the dwellers of the Hell and the dwellers of the Heaven , as appearing in the Qur'an. The most significant deprivation of the dwellers of the Hell is that God never talks to them, which makes them forlorn in the Hell. There are Qur'anic verses in this regard according to which dwellers of the Hell ask the guards to pray for them to God, and when the guards disappoint them, they pray to God on their own. The Qur'an says that their requests, cries, wishes of ransoms for release, and wishes of another opportunity to return to this world and compensate their actions are not heard by God. It is repeatedly emphasized that dwellers of the Hell receive no help, have no new opportunity, and are not given any safety conduct . According to a sermon attributed to Imam Ali (a) regarding the features of the Hell: \"it is a house where no mercy can be found and no praying by its dwellers is heard\". There are some hadiths, however, to the effect that in some exceptional cases their praying is heard by God: for example, the one according to which there is a servant of God in the Hell who kept calling God as \"Ya Hannan, Ya Mannan\" (O the Charitable, O the Benefactor) for a thousand years. Finally, God sends Jabra'il to him to answer his calls and forgives him. In Islamic Theology The issue of rewards and punishments in the afterlife, and in particular, the issue of the Hell, constitute a large portion of theological works. There are some common theological issues regarding the Hell or Heaven, as there are specific issues about either of the two. Whether the Hell and the Heaven exist now: one theological question is whether the Hell and Heaven are already created or not. The question seems to be posed by Hisham al-Futi for the first time; he asked the question because he thought there was no point for the Hell or the Heaven to exist before the resurrection . Some scholars of the Mu'tazila , Najjariyya , and scholars associated with the Mu'tazila, such as Zaydiyya and Khawarij took al-Futi's question seriously and maintained that the Hell and the Heaven might not already be created; it is, indeed, possible for them to exist or not exist now. Some people, such as Abu Hashim al-Juba'i agreed with al-Futi, and some of the Mu'tazila, such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i and Abu l-Hasan al-Basri as well as Imami and Ash'ari theologians maintained that the Hell and the Heaven already exist. Eternity and immortality: another common question about the Hell and the Heaven is that of their eternity and immortality. The question was posed by Juham b. Safwan on the ground that it is not possible for a contingent entity to be infinite. Jahiz allegedly believed that there is no eternal dwelling in the Hell and that the dwellers of the Hell will eventually turn into fire. However, proponents of the eternity of the Hell and the Heaven tried to reply to objections by appeal to philosophical and theological reasoning as well as rhetorical arguments . Wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell: along with the theological issue of infallibility in the Heaven and the voluntary or involuntary abstinence from wrong-doing in there, there is a theological issue about wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell. One important theory in this respect is the theory of ilja', according to which God forces the dwellers of the Hell to quit wrong-doings, and so their abstinence is not praiseworthy. However, others believe that their abstinence from wrong-doings is because of their lack of motivations for such actions. They believe that only wrong-doing without any obstinacy towards God is possible in the afterlife. Committers of major sins in the Hell: this is a ramification of the old question about people who commit major sins. Khawarij take committers of major sins to be unbelievers if they do not repent to God, and so for them, there is no significant difference between the position of an unbeliever and a committer of a major sin who did not repent to God. Of Khawarij, Najda b. 'Amir who was more modest believed that it is possible for such evil-doers to suffer a punishment in accordance with their sins outside the Hell and then enter the Heaven. In his view, the Hell is only home to unbelievers and so a Muslim evil-doer does not enter the Hell. His view was later revised by some of the Murji'a. Muqatil b. Sulayman believed that Muslim committers of major sins suffer the Hell from a distance on the Sirat bridge and will suffer in accordance with their sins, and will then go to the Heaven without entering the Hell. The view of the Mu'tazila about the punishment of Muslim wrong-doers is grounded in their position concerning Manzila bayn al-Manzilatayn (a position between the two positions). Most of the Mu'tazila believed that in the afterlife, all people are only divided into two groups: people of the Heaven and people of the Hell, and so for them, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell just like the unbelievers, except that their punishment will be milder than that of the unbelievers. According to Imami and Ash'ari theologians, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell if they are not forgiven by God and will be punished in accordance with their sins and will then go to the Heaven until no monotheist remains in the Hell. They take \"khulud\" in the Qur'an to mean a long, rather than an eternal, stay in the Hell. Some of the Mu'tazila have the same view, adding that it does not fit the divine justice for monotheist wrong-doers to stay in the Hell forever. Some Imami theologians deny that such wrong-doers will go to the Heaven, although they do believe that they will finally go out of the Hell. He identified such an intermediate position between the Hell and the Heaven with what is called \" A'raf \" or \" Barzakh \" in the Qur'an. The goodness of the Hell: one theological question about the Hell is whether eternal punishment in the Hell is good. The question is taken seriously by later Mu'tazili theologians. In the school of Basra , scholars such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i believed that punishment in the Hell is neither good, nor bad, and it is a matter of convention to call it good or bad. But in the school of Baghdad , people such as Abu Ja'far al-Iskafi believed that punishment in the Hell is good and is a divine mercy even for unbelievers who suffer them. In Islamic Sufism and Mysticism Muslim mystics, just like the people of sharia, take the Hell to be a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the Hell. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the sharia as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers. Early Sufis emphasized the fear of God, detachment from this world, thinking about death, and the punishment of sinners. They exhibited fear of the consequences of committing sins, and remorse and shame as well as buka' (crying) because of their sins. In this ascetic Sufism, fear is preferred to hope due to its stronger impact on one's will, ascetic life, and the awakening of the soul. Such themes became more interior in the views of Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya. She emphasized the fear of divine punishment and believed that such a fear should be a believer's guide. She replaced the fear of eternal punishment or hope of eternal reward by the eternal love of God and His servitude. In fact, a Sufi's ideal is love of, and unification with, God. Thus, sins make one separated from God and the Hell is, indeed, the separation from God, which is the biggest deprivation. They even believe that if the blessings of the Heaven are to prevent one from seeing the divine beauty, a lover of God had better go to the Hell and see His beauty. In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God. The highest desideratum for them was divine love and satisfaction. Dhu l-Nun al-Misri believed that fear of the Hell was nothing compared to the fear of separation from God. Sufis emphasized that the fire of the Hell has nothing to do with real believers and lovers of God. In the remarks of Sufis, there are expressions such as the Hell of separation, the suffering of distance from the Beloved, the Hell of distance, and the humility of distance which are used in contrast to the suffering or fire of the Hell. They imply that the real suffering is that of distance from God, which is taken by Sufis to be a painful punishment. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are only psychological states of the soul after its separation from the body. A soul is prosperous or miserable to the degree to which they know God. The humiliating punishment of the soul can cease by the removal of the distance, that is, by the removal of one's ignorance of God.

{"title": "Soul-taking", "text": "Soul-taking or Qabḍ al-rūḥ (Arabic: قَبْض الروح ) is to take away human lives at the time of death . This is carried out by Azrael ('Izra'il) and his representatives at the command of God . According to Islamic sources, people's souls are taken in different ways; for example, the souls of prophets (a) are taken after their own permissions, the souls of believers are taken by angels of mercy in an easy way, and the souls of unbelievers are taken with tortures and punishments . Some hadiths have recommended the recitation of the Qur'an 36 and the Qur'an 37 as well as moving the muhtadar (the person who is about to die) to the place in which he or she used to say prayers in order for his or her soul to be taken easily. The Notion Taking the soul is to separate one's soul from the body. It is referred to in the Qur'an as \"tawaffi\" (taking or grasping). When it is time for someone to die, Azrael and his representatives will take the person's soul at the command of God . According to religious sources, a human soul is taken gradually. When the soul is leaving the body, the person's legs and hands weaken at first, and the last part of the body that stops working is the throat. According to a hadith from Imam 'Ali (a) , at the time of death, the tongue will fail to talk. Then the death begins to spread to the rest of the body; the ears will stop working, so the person will not be able to talk and will not hear anything. The eyes will move around. The person sees the faces of the surrounding people and the movements of their lips, but he or she does not hear their voices. After a while, the death spreads to the eyes and then the life will go out of the body. How the Soul is Taken According to hadiths , the soul is taken gradually and painfully. Believers also feel the fears and hardships of death, though people's souls are taken in different ways. The death of prophets (a) and believers take place in an easier way than that of unbelievers. Prophets According to Shiite hadiths, the souls of prophets are taken very easily upon their permissions. There are stories in this regard. For example, at the time of the Prophet Muhammad 's (s) death, Azrael went to his house and asked for the permission to enter the house and take his soul. In this event, Azrael had a conversation with Fatima (a) . About the prophet Abraham (a) , it is said that Azrael went to him to take his soul. Abraham told him: \"does God like his friend (that is, Abraham) to die?\" Azrael went and then returned with God's message: \"is Abraham sad that he would meet his friend?\" As soon as Abraham heard this, he died. According to some hadiths, Azrael took Solomon 's soul while he relied on his cane in his palace. There are also stories about Moses (a) and Noah (a) being asked for permission by Azrael before their death. Believers According to Sura al-Nahl , the souls of believers are taken by the angels of mercy with ease, and they are given the news of going to the heaven . According to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , when a believer is about to die, shining angels with heavenly outfits sit around him or her, and then the Angel of Death (Azrael) tells him or her, \"O the pure soul! Come out to your Lord\". Then his or her soul is taken just like water coming out of the waterskin. According to some hadiths, when believers are about to die, they become impatient, but then the Prophet (s) and Ahl al-Bayt (a) go to them whereby they find peace and comfort. Unbelievers According to Islamic sources, the soul of an unbeliever is taken with suffering and excruciating pains. According to Quranic verses , the souls of unbelievers are taken with hardship and torture, while they are surrounded and beaten by angels of death from back and forth. There is a hadith from the Prophet (s) to the effect that when an unbeliever is about to dies, black-faced angels sit around him or her with anger, and then the Angel of Death goes to him or her, separating his or her soul from the body just like a comb separating trashes from the wool. Soul-Takers There are many verses in the Qur'an concerning the taking of the soul. In some verses, the taking of the soul is attributed to God, in others to the Angel of Death , and in still others to a group of angels. According to Quranic exegetes, the verses are not contradictory because God is the ultimate cause and agent of soul-taking but the act is immediately accomplished by Azrael or other angels who are Azrael's representatives. According to some sources, Azrael has many representatives and helpers, thus death is sometimes attributed to a group of angels. These angels are referred to as \"Nazi'at\", \"Sabihat\", \"Nashitat\" and \"Sabiqat\" each of whom undertakes the task of taking the souls of a certain group of beings. For example, \"Nazi'at\" are assigned the task of taking the souls of unbelievers with hardship and torture, and \"Nashitat\" are assigned the task of taking the souls of believers with mercy and comfort. A few scholars maintain that when a person is about to die, the same angels who were in charge of recording his or her actions will take his or her soul. Mitigating the Taking of the Soul Some hadiths have recommended that for a believer to make his or her soul be taken easily, he or she should be moved to the place where he or she used to say prayers . Other hadiths have recommended the recitation of Sura Saffat and Sura Yasin . Notes References Beliefs Rulings of the Dead Connection with the Dead Related Death Related"}
{"title": "Hereafter", "text": " The Hereafter or Ākhira (Arabic: الآخرة ) is the world after death , or the world after this world. The Hereafter is contrasted to the life in this world. The belief in the Hereafter is deemed a principle of Islam , which means that those who do not believe in the Hereafter do not count as Muslims. The Quran emphasizes the significance of the Hereafter, and the belief in life after death has been a tenet of all religions . It is said that more than one third of Quranic verses are concerned with the afterlife or the Hereafter. In Islamic theological books, the Hereafter is referred to as resurrection , for which transmitted and rational evidence is cited. Muslim scholars have adduced Quranic verses to show that the Hereafter is a world totally different from this world. They attribute specific features to it, including eternity, the distinction between the virtuous and evil-doers, seeing the outcomes of one’s deeds, and enjoyment of blessings in accordance with one’s merits. Some Muslim scholars maintain that the Hereafter begins once life in this world comes to an end, but others believe that the Hereafter exists at present—simultaneously with life in this world—and indeed, it encompasses this world. The Nature of the Hereafter Literally, the term al-akhira (the Hereafter) means the final, the subsequent, or the other. It refers to another world that comes after this world. The Quran describes the afterlife or post-mortem life as the Hereafter (104 times). It sometimes uses phrases such as “the abode of the Hereafter” and “the Last Day.” The Significance of the Belief in the Hereafter The belief in the Hereafter is a principle of the religion and a requirement for being a Muslim. That is, those who deny the Hereafter do not qualify as Muslims. According to Murtada Mutahhari , the second major doctrine—after monotheism —to which all prophets have called people is the belief in the Hereafter. According to Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi , more than one third of Quranic verses are concerned with the Hereafter. The Quran refers to the belief in the Hereafter as a tenet of all prophetical messages . Quranic verses describe the belief in the Hereafter as one of the three tenets of Islam, along with beliefs in God and in the prophet . There is a consensus among all Islamic denominations to the effect that the belief in the Hereafter is an essential of the religion ; that is, those who do not believe in it do not count as Muslims. In Islamic theological books, the Hereafter is discussed in terms of the “principle of resurrection or the return.” There are other issues associated with the Hereafter, including the barzakh (the purgatory), the resurrection , the bridge of sirat , reckoning (hisab), intercession , the Heaven , and the Hell , which figure in the Quran, hadiths , and the writings of Muslim scholars. According to the Quran, a Muslim should believe in all these. Arguments for the Existence of the Hereafter Muslim scholars hold that the main argument for the existence of the Hereafter consists in transmitted or textual evidence, including the revelation . That is, the fact that the prophets are infallible , and they report about the existence of the Hereafter and call people to this belief, is evidence for the existence of the Hereafter. A case in point is verse 7 of Qur'an 64 : “Say, ‘Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected.” According to Murtada Mutahhari , there are other non-transmitted or non-textual means by which one might prove the existence of the Hereafter. At least, they constitute evidence or signs for its existence. He mentions three such means: (1) knowledge of God, (2) knowledge of the world, and (3) knowledge of the human spirit or soul. Philosophical arguments presented by theologians for the existence of the Hereafter include the argument from divine wisdom and the argument from divine justice. The argument from divine wisdom runs as follows: it would be incompatible with the divine wisdom if He limited the human life, which is capable of eternity, to life in this world. This is because God has created human beings so that they could attain the greatest possible excellence or perfection, and this could not be realized in this world, because the existential value of afterlife perfections is incomparable to that of this-worldly perfections. The argument from divine justice proceeds as follows: since the virtuous and evil-doers do not see their proper rewards or punishments in this world, God’s justice requires the existence of another world in which each person receives what they deserve. Characteristics of the Hereafter and Its Difference from This World According to Murtada Mutahhari , there are dozens of Quranic verses concerning issues associated with the Hereafter, including life after death, the day of resurrection , how the dead would be resurrected, the scale, reckoning, records of people’s deeds, the Heaven , the Hell , and the eternity of the Hereafter. Muslim scholars have adduced Quranic verses to show that the Hereafter is radically different from this world and its governing order. In the Hereafter, all people who were born from the beginning to the end of the creation will live at the same time. People in the Hereafter are either absolutely happy or absolutely miserable, the former are provided with whatever they wish to have, and the latter suffer from everything they see as bad or painful. However, life in this world is a mixture of life and death, privilege and deprivation, misery and happiness, suffering and comfort, and sorrow and delight. The following are other characteristics of the Hereafter in accordance with Quranic verses and hadiths : Eternity: According to Quranic verses, the Hereafter is eternal or endless. For instance, verse 34 of Qur'an 50 states that, in the Hereafter, inhabitants of the Heaven are given the good tidings that “This is the day of immortality.” Moreover, in Ghurar al-hikam , Imam 'Ali (a) is quoted as saying that “this world comes to an end, while the Hereafter is eternal.” [22] The distinction between the virtuous and evil-doers: According to Quranic verses, in the Hereafter, the virtuous will be separated from evil-doers: \"And ‘Get apart today, you guilty ones!’\" [23] \"and the faithless will be gathered toward Hell, o that Allah may separate the bad ones from the good [24] \"Those who are wary of their Lord will be led to paradise in throngs.\" [25] \"and drive the guilty as a thirsty herd towards hell\" [26] Seeing the outcomes of one’s deeds: According to Quranic verses, people will see the outcomes of their deeds in the Hereafter: \"and that he will soon be shown his endeavour\" [27] \"So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it. [28] Merit-based privileges: In contrast to this world, in the Hereafter everyone would have what they deserve to have. According to a hadith from Imam 'Ali (a), “circumstances of this world are governed by incidents, while those of the Hereafter are governed by people’s entitlements.” [29] The Scope of the Hereafter There is a disagreement over the scope of the Hereafter: some people believe that it begins with a person’s death and his or her entrance in the world of barzakh (the purgatory). On the other hand, those who maintain that barzakh is not part of the Hereafter say that the latter begins when the world of barzakh comes to an end. Furthermore, theologians believe that the Hereafter occurs in the temporal future of this world; that is, it begins once life in this world comes to an end altogether. However, Muslim philosophers believe that the Hereafter exists at present; that is, it exists alongside life in this world. In other words, the Hereafter is a world with a higher-ranking existence than that of this world, and thus, it encompasses the latter. A Quranic verse adduced by these philosophers is verse 49 of Qur'an 9 : “indeed hell besieges the faithless.” Quranic and Hadith Recommendations about the Hereafter There are recommendations about the Hereafter in Quranic verses and hadiths, including the following: The life of the world is nothing but play and diversion, and the abode of the Hereafter is surely better for those who are Godwary. Do you not exercise your reason? [32] This is the abode of the Hereafter, which We shall grant to those who do not desire to domineer in the earth nor to cause corruption, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary. [33] Bibliography A book is written about the Hereafter by Shaykh 'Abbas Qummi , a scholar in the fourteenth/twentieth century, under Manazil al-akhira (Stations of the Hereafter). In this book, he describes the stages of the Hereafter in the following order: death, grave, barzakh, resurrection, and sirat (the bridge). The book also talks about the scale ( mizan ), reckoning, and punishments of the Hell. It recommends certain worships and moral manners for an easier experience of these afterlife stages. Manazil al-akhira was written in Persian, and it has been translated into Arabic, English, Turkish, and Urdu.

{"title": "Tatayur al-Kutub", "text": " Taṭāyur al-kutub (Arabic: تطایر الکتب ) is a stage of the resurrection in which one observes the book, or record, of his or her actions. This is an Islamic belief, emphasized by hadiths . Following some hadiths, exegetes of the Qur'an take the term to be derived from the Qur'an 17 :13 and 14, and some Muslim jurists take it obligatory to believe in Tatayur al-kutub. Lexicology The word \"tatayur\" literally means to fly, to disseminate, and to dispense. Although the word \"tatayur\" does not appear in the Qur'an, following some hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) , Qur'anic exegetes take the term to be derived from the Qur'an: \"every man's 'tayir' (bird or fate) we have fastened on his own neck\", followed by \"read your book (or records)\". Exegesis Qur'anic exegetes suggested two interpretations of the word \"ta'ir\" in the above Qur'anic verse: First: the word \"ta'ir\" (Arabic: طائر ) has its root in the word \"tayr\" (Arabic: طیر ) which means bird. Arabs used to fly a bird in order to know whether what they sought to do was good or bad. Later the good and bad actions themselves came to be called \"ta'ir\". Second: according to Abu 'Ubayda, by \"ta'ir\" Arabs meant fortune. In the verse immediately after the above verse, we read that the same \"ta'ir\" displays the book of people's actions to them on the Day of Judgment . According to some hadiths, this stage of the resurrection is called \"tatayur al-kutub\" or \"tatayur al-suhuf\". According to a hadith narrated from the Prophet (s) by Aisha , there are three stages of the resurrection in which one does not know or remember anyone: mizan (the measurement of one's good and bad actions), tatayur al-kutub or tatayur al-suhuf, and sirat (the bridge that everyone should pass in the resurrection). According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , \"ta'ir\" refers to the good and the evil that always accompany one until the Day of Judgment when the book of one's actions is given to him or her. Therefore, divine agents ( angels ) record one's actions—good and bad—in this world, and they open the record—the book—to the person after the resurrection, at the stage of tatayur al-kutub. Theologians and jurists take it obligatory for a Muslim to believe in 'tatayur al-kutub' as a stage of the resurrection, because it was mentioned in the Qur'an. Thus jurists maintain that it is one of the doctrines that should be mentioned to a dead person at the time of talqin .

{"title": "Ihtidar", "text": "Iḥtiḍār (Arabic: الإحتضار ) is a terminology in fiqh (jurisprudence) which means the presence of death . A person who is about to die and whose soul is about to leave his body is called \"muḥtaḍar\"( مُحتَضَر ). When a person is in such a state, people around him have certain jurisprudential obligations . Definition \"Ihtidar\" literally means \"presence\". In the religious terminology, it means the presence of death and the arrival of the time at which one's soul leaves the body. In the Qur'an In the Qur'an 4 in the Qur'an , \"ihtidar\" is characterized as the presence of death and it is emphasized that tawba of sinners is not accepted when they are in this state. The Qur'an 5 refers to the pains and hardships suffered by unjust people in this state while the angels talk to them. And according to the Qur'an 56 , remind people who deny the truth of the Qur'an that there will be a time at which their life comes to their throat and they are asked to return a \"muhtadar\" to life, if they can. In Hadith According to some hadiths, the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) go to the \"muhtadar\"; if he or she is a believer, then they give them the good news of going to the Heaven and if they are unbelievers, then they notify them of the divine anger. The believer is given the option to go back to this world, but upon seeing their place in the Heaven, they choose to go to the Afterlife . After seeing their place in the Heaven, some believers ask to go back to this world just to inform their family and friends about their position in the Afterlife, but they are not given the permission to do so. Practices There are certain jurisprudential rulings for ihtidar which are referred to as \"manners or practices of ihtidar\". It is a collective obligation for all Muslims to lay the body of a Muslim who is about to die on his back such that his or her soles are in the direction of the qibla . It is mustahab or recommended to suggest shahadatayn to a person who is about to die, that is, shahadatayn should be recited in order for the muhtadar to repeat it. If the person suffers too much pain while dying, it is recommended that they be moved to the place where they usually said their prayers . It is also recommended to recite the Qur'an near the \"muhtadar\", particularly the Qur'an , the Qur'an 37 and the Qur'an 33 . It is also recommended to recite Al-'Adila Supplication when a person is about to die. And it is recommended to suggest the following supplications to the \"muhtadar\": \"O God! Forgive my many sins! And accept my little bit of obedience\" ( اللهم اغفر لی الکثیر من معاصیک، واقبل منی الیسیر من طاعتک ), \"O Who Accepts the little and Forgives the many, Accept my little and Forgive my many; truly Thou Are the Pardoning, the Forgiving\" ( یا من یقبل الیسیر ویعفو عن الکثیر، اقبل منی الیسیر واعف عنی الکثیر، إنک أنت العفو الغفور ). It is unfavorable for a junub or a Menstruating woman to be near the muhtadar, as it is unfavorable to leave the muhtadar alone with women, to put an iron stuff on muhtadar's stomach, to cry, and to talk too much near the muhtadar.

{"title": "Afterlife Bodies", "text": "Afterlife bodies (Arabic: الأبدان الأُخرویة ) are sorts of bodies that were introduced by Mulla Sadra Shirazi in order to explain bodily resurrection . On the basis of some verses of the Qur'an , Muslims believe that our resurrection will be bodily, that is, humans will have bodies after the resurrection, but there are controversies with respect to the details of the bodily resurrection. Appealing to the apparent meaning of the verses, some Islamic theologians maintain that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same body that they had in this world, and they will undergo the events of the resurrection with this body. In contrast, some philosophers have denied the bodily resurrection; they have instead believed in spiritual resurrection . On the basis of his philosophical foundations in the Transcendental Theosophy , Mulla Sadra accepts bodily resurrection, but gives a new account of it. Views of the Theologians Many verses of the Qur'an are concerned with the resurrection, the Dooms Day , and people's return to God; for example, \"Say, He will revive them who produced them the first time, and He has knowledge of all creation.\" Qur'an 36 :79. \"Does man suppose that We will not put together his bones [at resurrection]? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to [re]shape [even] his fingertips!\" Qur'an 75 :3,4. \"Does he not know, when what is [buried] in the graves is turned over\" Qur'an 100 :9. \"And when the Trumpet is blown, behold, there they will be, scrambling towards their Lord from their graves!\" Qur'an 36:51 The apparent meaning of many verses regarding the resurrection is that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same bodies that they had during their life in this world. Most theologians believe that we cannot interpret these verses otherwise; so the bodies with which people will be resurrected are identical with the ones with which they lived in this world. This view is called bodily resurrection . In Shiite theology , the belief in the bodily resurrection is an obligation for any Muslim. But the belief in its specific details is not an obligation. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi says, \"It is an obligation to believe that God will revive all people in the resurrection and He will return people's souls to their original bodies. If anyone denies this or interprets it in such a way that leads to its apparent denial —as we hear some of our contemporary unbelievers— then, by the consensus of all Muslims, they will no longer be believers in Islam . For there are many verses of the Qur'an demonstrating that there will be a new life in the resurrection, and implying that its rejection leads to paganism . And one shall not pay attention to the doubts of philosophers [about bodily resurrection] who say that recreating the nonexistent (I'adat al-Ma'dum) is impossible. One shall not take seriously the interpretations of people who read bodily resurrection as spiritual resurrection . Views of Philosophers Muslim philosophers have tried to provide a rational account of the resurrection and its qualities. Though rational arguments are, in their view, evidence of the necessity of the resurrection and the existence of a world other than this world, the details of how the resurrection will occur—whether it is only spiritual, or both bodily and spiritual, and if it is bodily, whether the body involved is a material, elemental body or it is an imaginal, astral body—cannot be demonstrated by rational, philosophical arguments. This is why Ibn Sina (Avicenna) says: It must be known that part of the resurrection is approved by shari'a , and there is no way to demonstrate it except by shari'a and the testimony of the Prophet (s) —this is the part of it concerning the revival of the dead bodies. We must accept the quality of bodily resurrection and its details in accordance with religious evidence and revelation, since this is the most certain and the most complete criterion for man to acquire assuring truths. On the basis of their philosophical foundations, Peripatetic (masha') philosophers believed that after death, human bodies go out of existence, and since it is philosophically impossible for a nonexistent or annihilated object to come back into existence, human bodies cannot be revived, that is, they cannot re-exist. But the soul, because of its immateriality and spirituality, can never go out of existence, and so it survives the death of its associated body. Since these philosophers could not solve the philosophical problems of bodily resurrection —problems such as the re-existence of nonexistent objects— they have perforce tended to the spiritual resurrection or took it to be philosophically non-provable. Mulla Sadra's View After the Peripatetic philosophers, Mulla Sadra with his foundations of the Transcendental Wisdom , provided a different account of the bodily resurrection . He maintained that though the resurrection is in fact bodily and what is resurrected is the combination of one's body and the soul, the body resurrected in the Dooms Day is a delicate body which is exactly similar to (though not identical with) one's this-worldly body, but it has the disposition or potentiality for the afterlife . These changes in the position, magnitude and the shape of one's body do not threaten one's personal identity or persistence through time, since persons are individuated by their souls and not their bodies. This is why the person in the afterlife is judged to be the same person in this world, though his or her apparent features might have changed. So if the soul survives, the changes or transformations in the matter will not be important. Differences between Afterlife Bodies and This-Worldly Bodies Mulla Sadra enumerates the differences between afterlife bodies and this-worldly bodies as follows: Afterlife bodies cannot be corrupted, unlike this-worldly bodies. [6] Afterlife bodies have a spirit and life—in fact, they are identical with life, that is, their lives are essential, rather than accidental, to them, but some this-worldly bodies have life and some lack it. [7] Afterlife bodies are infinite as to the number of the conceptions and perceptions of their souls, since the arguments for the finitude of the dimensions do not apply to them. [8] Afterlife bodies are intermediate between the two worlds—they combine spirituality and corporeality, and they lack most features and properties of this-worldly bodies. [9] Afterlife bodies do not spatially prevent one another. [10] This-worldly bodies emerge gradually, but afterlife bodies emerge abruptly.

{"title": "Qiyama", "text": "Al-Qīyāma (Arabic: القيامة ) or Day of Judgement , according to Islamic teachings, is a day when, by the will of God , all humans gather in the presence of God for the reckoning of their deeds in this world. In the Qur'an , seventy names and attributes are mentioned for it. Before that day, shocking happenings will take place on the earth and in the sky, which are known as the indications of the Hour . The Qur'an and hadiths emphasize that the time of the Day of Judgement is not known to anyone but God. On that day, people's deeds are measured in accordance to religious leaders (the Prophet (s) , Imams (a) and the righteous) and anyone whose deeds and beliefs have better similarity with their deeds and beliefs will be happier. Names In the Qur'an, about seventy names and attributes about Qiyama are mentioned, the most famous of which are: Al-Sa'a (the Hour) Yawm al-Qiyama (Day of Resurrection) Al-Yawm al-Akhir (the Last Day) Yawm al-Hisab (Day of Reckoning) Yawm al-Din (Day of Retribution) Yawm al-Jam' (Day of Gathering) Yawm al-Fasl (Day of Judgment) Yawm al-Khuruj (Day of Rising [from the dead]) Yawm al-Maw'ud (the Promised Day) Yawm al-Khulud (Day of Immortality) Yawm al-Hasra (Day of Regret) Yawm al-Taghabun (Day of Dispossession) Yawm al-Ba'th (Day of Resurrection). Qiyama is also called \"Qiyamat al-Kubra\" in opposite to Qiyamat al-Sughra or barzakh which begins just after human's death and continues until Qiyamat al-Kubra. Precursors and Signs Some happenings take place before Qiyama, which are called Ashrat al-Sa'a . The glorious Qur'an mentioned some of those signs: Crumbling of the mountains Moving of the seas Great and destructive earthquakes Darkness of the sun Darkness of the moon Darkness of stars Splitting the sky Blowing the Trumpet by Israfil Time Only God knows about the time of Qiyama; so, it would be sudden for all, so that many will be unaware of it. “ They question you concerning the Hour, when will it set in? Say, ‘Its knowledge is only with my Lord: none except Him shall manifest it at its time. It will weigh heavy on the heavens and the earth. It will not overtake you but suddenly.’ They ask you as if you were in the know of it. Say, ‘Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.’ ” — Qur'an 7:187 Not having knowledge about its time as well as its sudden happening and its tremendousness makes it never considered far by people and they always await it and thus prepare themselves to be rescued then. This unawareness has a positive and constructive effect on the education of people's souls, their attention to their responsibilities and avoiding sins. Place According to verses of the Qur'an, on the Day of Judgement, all the dead suddenly and at once will be resurrected by the power of God . They exit the graves and gather and their deeds will be reckoned. The place of their attendance and reckoning is in an environment, the reality of which is not clear to us. However, based on the Qur'an, it is known that the sky and the earth change at that time. An environment (which is immaterial according to some views) is created in which Qiyama takes place and creatures gather in the presence of God. The glorious Qur'an points to this change of the earth and the sky as: “ The day the earth is transformed into another earth and the heavens [as well], and they are presented before Allah, the One, the All-paramount. ” — Quran 14:48 Duration About the duration of Qiyama, there are two verses in the Qur'an : a thousand years and fifty thousand years, and according to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , Qiyama has fifty stations, passing each takes a thousand years. Events Resurrection of Humans In many verses , the Qur'an has mentioned the way humans will be resurrected in Qiyama. Qur'an 39 :68 says that with one blow in the Israfil's horn , all people will die except those God wishes who do not. Then, another time, there will be a blow in horn and everyone is resurrected at once and awaits reckoning. Reckoning The most important event in Qiyama is reckoning people's deeds. It is based on the rules delivered to people by the prophets (a) in the forms of ideological teachings and practical rulings. Everyone is responsible for his own practices, no one can bear the burden of another person's sins and no one will be treated unjustly. Some issues are important in the reckoning of the deeds, which are: Questions in Qiyama: Some issues will be questioned about in Qiyama, the Qur'an has mentioned some of them: Material and spiritual blessings of God ; [17] Sinners will be asked about their ideological, practical and moral sins [18] Polytheists will be asked about their treatment of the prophets (a) [19] About the live-buried girls [20] About life About properties About deeds and manners About the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) In this regard, the Prophet (s) said: \"In Qiyama, no servant would take any step, but he would be asked about four things: how he spent his life, from where he gained his properties and in what way he spent it, about the actions he performed, and about the love for us the Ahl al-Bayt (a).\" Good deeds of Non-Muslims: the actions of those who believe in God and the hereafter and performed them with the intention of closeness to God, will be accepted. If they do not have any fault for not having faith , they will benefit the fruits of those of their actions which are not related to faith. However, if they are to blame about not having faith, meaning that they knew about Islam and its teachings, but they refused to accept them without a reason and only due to their prejudice and obstinacy, all their good deeds will be lost. Status of the deprived: the deprived ones are those who are so weak intellectually, physically, or financially that they cannot distinguish the truth from the falsehood, or that although they recognize the true belief, they cannot completely fulfill their duties or immigrate, due to their physical disability, financial weakness, or restrictions the environment imposes on them. For example, a person who is in a region, most of the residents of which are disbelievers , the power is in their hand and there is no religious scholar there to deliver religious teachings to them, or the environment of disbelief and fear does not let that happen and the person cannot exit there and go to Islamic environment or that they never thought that there might be a religion of the truth out there. Such people will be included in the forgiveness of God and would not go to the hell . Status of the insane: insane ones have no responsibility as long as they have no sanity in this world and the power to recognize the truth and would not be questioned in the hereafter, because one of the requirements of performing the obligation is sanity. In a hadith , Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"In Qiyama, God will be harsh in the reckoning of the servants' deeds relative to the level of intellect He bestowed upon them.\" Status of children and babies: those who die in childhood before they have the power to distinguish the truth from the falsehood and their parents were Muslim, will join their parents and go to the paradise . The way the children whose parents are disbeliever will be treated it is not known to us; however, based on Shi'a beliefs and the verses of the Qur'an , they would not receive punishments ; because, there would be any punishments if a person has received the message of God, while he has reached an age of responsibility and is sane and voluntarily opposes the order of God. Therefore, a person who dies in childhood has no obligation in the first place, so he would go to hell for not observing them. Resurrection of Animals It can be understood from some verses and hadiths that like humans, animals too will be resurrected in Qiyama and will be reckoned according to their awareness and responsibilities. However, unlike humans who go either to the hell or to the paradise, animals will die and turn to earth after reckoning and receiving justice about their deeds; i.e. if they have done any injustice, they will receive the retribution for it in Qiyama. It is transmitted from Abu Dhar that one day they were in the presence of the Prophet (s) and in front of them, two goats hit each other with their horns. The Prophet (s) asked his Companions , \"do you know why they hit each other?\" His companions answered, \"No.\" The Prophet (s) said, \"but, God knows why and soon will judge between them.\" Record of Actions All the actions a person does in his life are recorded somewhere, known as the record of actions. It is so accurate and clear that no one can deny it. “ The Book will be set up. Then you will see the guilty apprehensive of what is in it. They will say, 'Woe to us! What a book is this! It omits nothing, big or small, without enumerating it.' They will find present whatever they had done, and your Lord does not wrong anyone. ” — Quran 18:49 According to verses of the Qur'an , the righteous ones' record of actions will be given to their right hand and sinners' record of actions will be given to their left hand. Embodiment of Actions The embodiment of actions means that whatever a person does in this world, will be represented in the next world in a form appropriate to that world. In other words, rewards and punishments, blessings, and hardships are the reality of deeds people have done in this world and realized in the next world. Thus, an action a person does in this world has two forms; one worldly form which we see now and a hereafter from which we cannot see now. On the Day of Resurrection , after some events, the hereafter truth of an action will be revealed and their worldly forms go away and bring about happiness or sadness to its doer. Thus, based on this opinion, the rewards for everyone's deeds will be the truth of his deeds. “ The day when every soul will find present whatever good it has done; and as to whatever evil it has done it will wish there were a far distance between it and itself. Allah warns you to beware of [disobeying] Him, and Allah is most kind to [His] servants. ” — Qur'an 3:30 Witnesses On the Day of Judgement, when humans gather for the reckoning of deeds and receiving rewards for them, beside the record of actions , there are certain witnesses which witness our deeds and give testimony to them in the gathering. According to religious texts, there are some witnesses for our deeds including: God the Almighty [29] Prophets (a) , especially the Prophet of Islam (s) [30] Infallible Imams (a) [31] Angels [32] The earth [33] Limbs of the body [34] Time [35] “ And say, 'Go on working', Allah will see your conduct, and His Apostle and the faithful [as well], and you will be returned to the Knower of the sensible and the Unseen, and He will inform you concerning what you used to do. ” — Qur'an 9:105 Scale of Deeds On the Day of Judgement, humans' actions will be measured by a certain means, not like the scales in this world. This measure refers to measuring and comparison of everyone's deeds using one model. Based on hadiths , scale in the hereafter refers to the deeds of the prophets (a), Imams (a) , and righteous ones and on the Day of Judgement, peoples' deeds will be compared and measured with the deeds of these great personalities and will be considered as worthy as they are similar to their beliefs, attributes, and deeds. Imam al-Sadiq (a) explained the scales in Qiyama saying, \"The scale for measuring on that day is the Prophets (a) and their vicegerents.\" In another hadith, the scale in Qiyama is considered Imam 'Ali (a) and Imams (a) after him. Sirat Bridge According to Islamic sources and texts, Sirat is the name of a bridge over the hell across from the paradise , on which all the people pass. Righteous ones pass it swiftly and evildoers fall from it into the hell. In some hadiths, the speed of people in crossing the bridge depends on their faith , sincerity, and righteous deeds. The Prophet (s) described this bridge saying that \"over the hell, there is a bridge, thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword.\" In another hadith, the Prophet (s) said, \"in Qiyama, when Sirat is put up over the hell , only those can cross it who have permission and the permission is the wilaya of 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a).\" Notes References Death Related World of Barzakh Related concepts"}
{"title": "Resurrection", "text": " Resurrection (Arabic: معاد , Maʿād) is one of the roots of faith in Islam and means the return of people after death into life on the Day of Judgment ( qiyama ). According to this belief, all of the people will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment and their actions will be judged in the presence of God and they will be requited. Resurrection has a great importance in Islam and nearly one third of Qur'an is about the resurrection and subjects related to it. Believing in the resurrection has a great effect in the manner of life and causes people to do more good and avoid evil. Resurrection could be imagined in two ways: spiritual resurrection, bodily resurrection. The most important objections proposed about the subject is about the rational possibility of resurrection; some of which are: the objection of the eater and the eaten , the objection of returning the extinct , and the objection about the knowledge and the power of God. Qur'an mentions some instances of resurrection in order to prove the possibility of resurrection. Proving the rational possibility of resurrection is possible using rational reasons, like the argument of creation ( fitra ), the argument of wisdom, the argument of justice, and the argument of mercy. Concept Ma'ad (Arabic: معاد ) means to return; and in the terminology of theology , it means revival of people after death, and in judgment day (qiyama) their actions will be judged and the righteous people will reach their reward and the bad people will receive their punishment . Importance Believing in the resurrection influences the life in two ways: Personal life : The main motive of the person's actions is to fulfill the one's needs and wishes, and ultimately to reach an eternal happiness without any suffering. But the behavior of a person is related to the recognition of the goals of life. If someone assumes that the life is only limited to the worldly life, he will put all his efforts in order to reach the worldly joys and to benefit the most from the rich of the world. In contrast, when someone recognizes himself upper than the worldly life and does not acknowledge the death as the end of life, and considers his actions as a road to reach his eternal happiness in the afterlife (akhira), plans his life in a way to be the most beneficent for his eternal life. Social life : The belief in the resurrection, has a great effect on the social life and the mutual behavior of people. Believing in the next life and the eternal reward and punishment, has a great effect on regarding the other's rights and helping the poor. When this belief is accepted in a society, there will be less pressure needed for implementation of the just rules and for prevention of cruelty. Obviously if this belief was globally accepted, the international struggles would be less. The importance of the belief in the resurrection is to the extent that even the monotheism , if not accompanied by believing in the resurrection, is not enough for giving a direction to one's life. This is the reason of the emphasis of the Abrahamic religions on resurrection and the especial effort of divine prophets in the strengthening of the belief in hearts of people. Soul The correct imagination of resurrection is only possible when the true realization of the soul is achieved. In the divine view, the soul is something other than the body and its attributes. It is necessary to note and admit some points about the soul: The soul exists The soul is something substantive , not one of the accidents for the body. The soul is independent from the body and remains alive after the body decomposes. The combination of the soul and the body is not a combination in which with the death of one side, the other side also dies, but the soul is the main part of the existence of human and as far as the soul lives, the identity and the character of the person is preserved. This is the reason why the replacement of the body cells does not compromise the unity of the person; because the true criterion of the unity of a human, is the unity of his soul. The soul is taken by the angel of death ( 'Izra'il ), while the body gradually decomposes and disappears. The Qur'an (32:10-11), mentioning the existence of the soul, answers the objection of deniers of resurrection: “ وَقَالُوا أَإِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِي الْأَرْضِ أَإِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ ۚ بَلْ هُمْ بِلِقَاءِ رَبِّهِمْ كَافِرُونَ (10) قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ They say, 'When we have been lost in the dust, shall we be indeed created anew?' Rather they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord. (10) Say, '{You will not be lost, but} You will be taken away by the angel of death, who has been charged with you. Then you will be brought back to your Lord.' ” — Qur'an, 32:10, 11 Theories Denial of resurrection Some of the old theologians thought that, the resurrection means the returning of the extinct. They thought that when one dies, one completely disappears and becomes extinct; so when the religions announce about the resurrection it means that the human after becoming extinct, will be returned. Proving the resurrection Those who believe in resurrection hold various opinions as follows: Spiritual resurrection only : Islamic Peripatetic philosophers not only considered the bodily resurrection improvable, but also because of rational objections, recognized it as unacceptable. They believed that the resurrection is the return of the soul, without the body, because the body is destroyed after death and only the soul remains. Yet according to Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) the greatest Islamic Peripatetic philosopher, although it is rationally unprovable that the body returns on the Day of Judgment, but because the Prophet (s) had announced it, this is a proof and it must be believed. [5] Bodily resurrection only : According to this view, the whole reality of man is his body and after death it decomposes. in the Judgement Day, this body by divine knowledge and power will reconstruct. In this view there is no resurrection for soul. [6] Spiritual and Bodily resurrection : This view is a kind of combination between previous theories. Supporters of this view explain their idea differently: The return of soul to the very mundane material body The return of the soul to the etheric body The return of the elemental body to the immaterial soul The return of the soul to a developed elemental body The soul creates a body for itself adaptive to its attributes and the world after the Resurrection Resurrection with a Hurqaliya'i body Proving the Resurrection There are two kinds of reasons for proving the resurrection. The first, proves the necessity of the other world, and the second, proves the possibility of the resurrection. Some of the reasons are mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith . Reasons of the Necessity of the Resurrection Reason of the Creation (Fitra) The reason consists of some premises: Every human, by creation ( fitra ), has a desire to be eternal. No desire in human is null, because God is wise and the wise does not do anything null. The worldly life is not eternal So it is necessary to have a permanent world, in which the desire of human to be eternal is satisfied. [7] Reason of Wisdom (Hikma) The reason consists of some premises: Human and the world are creations of God Creations of God are not null God has created the world in such a manner that the most goodness possible is accomplished. The material world, is a mixture of good and evil that are in struggle with each other. Human, has an immortal soul and can reach a permanent goodness. If the life is limited to this world, the aim of God from the creation of the world is not fulfilled, because there's no benefit in making a thing, then destroying it. So knowing that God is wise, there must be another world beyond this worldly life, so that the aim of the creation is satisfied, especially due to many difficulties in this worldly life, so even if the permanent continuation of the worldly life was possible, it was not compatible with the wisdom of God. The reason is mentioned in Qur'an (44:38-41): “ وَ ما خَلَقْنَا السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضَ وَ ما بَینَهُما لاعِبینَ (38) ما خَلَقْناهُما إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَ لکنَّ أَکثَرَهُمْ لا یعْلَمُونَ (39) إِنَّ یوْمَ الْفَصْلِ میقاتُهُمْ أَجْمَعینَ We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them for play (38) We did not create them except with reason; but most of them do not know (39) Indeed the Day of Judgement is the tryst for them all. ” — Qur'an, 44:38-40 Reason of Mercy God is merciful ; The mercy of God covers all of His creatures; Covering of the God's mercy to all of creatures requires that every creature has a chance to activate its talents; Human achieves the maturity and gains the ability to benefit from spiritual gifts; This world, because of its limits, does not have the capacity of the spiritual gifts. So there have to be another world in which everyone can benefit from the results of the maturity one has achieved. In Qur'an (6:12) this reason is mentioned: “ قُلْ لِمَنْ ما فِی السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضِ قُلْ لِلَّهِ کتَبَ عَلی نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ لَیجْمَعَنَّکمْ إِلی یوْمِ الْقِیامَةِ لا رَیبَ فیهِ الَّذینَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لا یؤْمِنُونَ Say, 'To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?' Say, 'To Allah. He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself. He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Those who have ruined their souls1 will not have faith.' ” — Qur'an, 6:12 Reason of Justice One of the attributes of God is Justice; In the worldly life people have free will to choose between good and bad actions; Some people have used their freedom to worship God and serve of others; and in contrast, there are criminals who have chased their lust in their lifetime and have committed the worst sins; The divine justice of God requires that everyone sees the results of his actions, good people get rewarded, and the bad get their punishment. This world does not have the capacity that people see the requital of their actions; as most of the people do not see the punishment or the reward of their actions in their life; Therefore, as this world is for the test of people and fulfilling the tasks God had appointed them to; there must be another world for people to see the results of their actions, so that the justice of God be fulfilled. In the Qur'an, in some verses, the difference of the good people and the bad, and their different destinations, is mentioned (45:21-22): “ أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذینَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّیئاتِ أَنْ نَجْعَلَهُمْ کالَّذینَ آمَنُوا وَ عَمِلُوا الصَّالِحاتِ سَواءً مَحْیاهُمْ وَ مَماتُهُمْ ساءَ ما یحْکمُونَ (21) وَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ وَ لِتُجْزی کلُّ نَفْسٍ بِما کسَبَتْ وَ هُمْ لا یظْلَمُونَ Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make! (21) Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. ” — Qur'an, 45:21-22 Reasons of the Possibility of the Resurrection In the Qur'an different occurrences of the dead returning to life is mentioned, so that the believers in the Qur'an are assured that the resurrection is possible and feasible, and God is able to do it. The cases of the dead becoming alive mentioned in the Qur'an are: Companions of the Cave : The story of the companions of the cave is mentioned in the Qur'an, Allah introduces the reason of their second life and the discovery of people about them, for that people know that there is no doubt about the occurrence of the resurrection. “ وَکذَلِک أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَیهِمْ لِیعْلَمُوا أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَا رَیبَ فِیهَا Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make! (21) Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. ” — Qur'an, 45:21-22 Resurrection Miracles of Jesus In the Qur'an the miracles of Jesus ('Isa) (a) is mentioned, that he was rising the dead, with the permission of God (3:49): “ وَ أُبْرِئُ الْأَکمَهَ وَ الْأَبْرَصَ وَ أُحْی الْمَوْتی بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ And I heal the blind and the leper and I revive the dead by Allah's leave. ” — Qur'an, 3:49 Budding of the Plants The budding of the plants in the spring after they became dry in the autumn is similar to the resurrection of human after death. Qur'an (30:50) considers the budding of the plants as an example of the rising of the dead: “ فَانظُرْ إِلَی آثَارِ رَحْمَتِ اللَّهِ کیفَ یحْیی الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا إِنَّ ذَلِک لَمُحْیی الْمَوْتَی وَهُوَ عَلَی کلِّ شَیءٍ قَدِیرٌ So observe the effects of Allah's mercy: how He revives the earth after its death! Indeed He is the reviver of the dead, and He has power over all things. ” — Qur'an, 30:50 Also there are other instances of the resurrection mentioned in the Qur'an such as the resurrection of birds for Prophet Ibrahim (a) and resurrection of 'Uzayr , one hundred years after death. Resurrection in the Qur'an Importance of the Resurrection in the Qur'an More than one third of the verses of Qur'an , are about the eternal life; these verses could be categorized in seven categories: Verses that state the necessity of believing in the afterlife ( akhira ) [11] Verses that state the harsh results of rejecting the resurrection. [12] Verses that mention the eternal gifts of the paradise [13] Verses that mention the punishments of the hell [14] Verses that note the connection of good and bad actions with the destination in the afterlife Verses that describe the possibility and the necessity of the resurrection Verses answered the questions and objections of the deniers of the resurrection Verses that state that the root of all the crimes and the deviances is the denial of the resurrection. [15] Most of the dialogues and advices of the prophets to their people was on the subject of the resurrection. Their effort to prove the resurrection was even more than monotheism ; because the resistance of people in accepting this subject is more than other beliefs. Roots of the Denial of the Resurrection In the Qur'an's view, the root of some people's denial of the resurrection is: Materialism : In the view of materialists, every incorporeal subject is denied. Tendency to irresponsibility : the psychological motive of tendency to irresponsibility and immorality, causes the denial of the resurrection; because believing in the resurrection and the Day of Judgment is a powerful factor for feeling responsibility and accepting the moral limitations and self-controlling. On the contrary, denying the resurrection opens all the gates to all of evil (Qur'an, 75:5): “ أَ یحْسَبُ الْإِنْسانُ أَلَّنْ نَجْمَعَ عِظامَهُ (3) بَلی قادِرِینَ عَلی أَنْ نُسَوِّی بَنانَهُ (4) بَلْ یرِیدُ الْإِنْسانُ لِیفْجُرَ أَمامَهُ Does man suppose that We shall not put together his bones? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to proportion [even] his fingertips! (4) Rather, man desires to go on living viciously. ” — Qur'an, 75:5 Some theoretical objections : there has been some theoretical objections about the possibility of the resurrection due to some ambiguity in resurrection and how it will occur. Answer to Some Objections Objection of the Eater and the Eaten According to the objection of the eater and the eaten, which is one of the oldest objections about the bodily resurrection, if a person becomes the food for another person, in the time of the resurrection, will the eaten parts be in the body of the eater or in the body of the eaten? Either way, the body of one of them will not be resurrected completely. Based on this objection, the Peripatetic philosophers believed that the bodily resurrection is not rationally provable. But the theologians attempted to answer the objection. Most of the theologians, differentiated between the primary and secondary parts of body, and claimed that the primary parts of human body never become part of the body of another. Mulla Sadra , proposing the theory of the imaginal body, which is not a subject to this objection, offered another expression for the bodily resurrection. Objection of the Returning of the Extinct One of the objections discussed about the resurrection is that when a human dies, his/her body becomes extinct. Then, if the resurrection is true, so God has to return something that is extinct; and because the return of the extinct is rationally impossible, so is the resurrection. In Qur'an the objection and its answer is mentioned (32:10-11): “ وَقَالُوا أَئِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِی الْأَرْضِ أَئِنَّا لَفِی خَلْقٍ جَدِیدٍ بَلْ هُم بِلِقَاء رَبِّهِمْ کافِرُونَ (10) قُلْ یتَوَفَّاکم مَّلَک الْمَوْتِ الَّذِی وُکلَ بِکمْ ثُمَّ إِلَی رَبِّکمْ تُرْجَعُونَ They say, 'When we have been lost in the dust, shall we be indeed created anew?' Rather they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord (10) Say, 'You will be taken away by the angel of death, who has been charged with you. Then you will be brought back to your Lord.' ” — Qur'an, 32:10-11 So the resurrection is the return of the existing soul not something extinct. Objection about the knowledge and the power of God and the ability of body In the objection, it is stated that every action need a doer and also an object to which the action be applied. If the resurrection is going to be done, on the one hand, there must be someone with enough knowledge and power to do so, and on the other hand, the body must have the ability to be returned, while the life has its own conditions which becomes available gradually, like an embryo in a womb with appropriate conditions gradually becomes complete and turns into a human; but in a body which is dead and disjointed such a condition is not present so it cannot come back to life. Qur'an answered the objection in some verses, in some, compared the resurrection to the germination of seeds from the soil, and in some other compared the resurrection with the first creation of human (22:5); and so mentions the infinite knowledge of God and His power to resurrect the people; so it is possible that a rotten body which is turned into soil rises and comes back to life: “ یا أَیهَا النَّاسُ إِنْ کنْتُمْ فِی رَیبٍ مِنَ الْبَعْثِ فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاکمْ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ نُطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ مُضْغَةٍ مُخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَیرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ لِنُبَینَ لَکمْ... وَتَرَی الْأَرْضَ هَامِدَةً فَإِذَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَیهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنْبَتَتْ مِنْ کلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِیجٍ O people! If you are in doubt about the resurrection, [consider that] WE indeed created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then from a clinging mass, then from a fleshy tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest [Our power] to you... And you see the earth torpid, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells, and grows every delightful kind [of plant]. ” — Qur'an, 22:5 About the ability of the dead body for becoming alive again, it must be said that the rules and the system present in the world is not the only system possible, and the rules and causes known in the world are not the only rules and causes for the occurrences, as there have occurred many extraordinary occurrences like the livening of dead people and animals, some of which are mentioned in the Qur'an. Qur'an (20:51-52) says about the infinite knowledge of God: “ قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَی (51) قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّی فِی کتَابٍ لَّا یضِلُّ رَبِّی وَلَا ینسَی He (Pharaoh) said, 'What about the former generations?' (51) He (Moses) said, 'Their knowledge is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord neither makes any error nor forgets.' ” — Qur'an, 20:51-52 See also Usul al-din Hereafter Day of Separation Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related Death Related and Tribes and Groups Others Common principles of Islam Specific principles of Shia"}

Imam al-Sadiq (a) said that \"when God wills to uncover his (that is, Imam al-Mahdi (a)'s) status, He will inspire it in his heart, and then he reappears and undertakes the divine task\". It is worth mentioning that the stage of rising (such as undertaking tasks) is later than the stage of reappearance. That is, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will first reappear, and after his companions gather around him and other conditions are met, he will rise against cruel governments. Second Stage (Rising) Imam al-Sajjad (a) is quoted as saying that \"when our al-Qa'im rises, God will remove fear from the hearts of our Shiites \". Imam al-Sadiq (a) said: \"al-Qa'im will rise when he is not under the pledge of allegiance with anyone\". It is not the case that all hadiths using the word \"Qiyam\" (rising) and its cognates about Imam al-Mahdi (a) are concerned with the stage of rising; there are some hadiths in which the word is used for the stage of reappearance. However, it remains true that most of such hadiths concern the stage after the reappearance. The Prophet (s) is quoted as saying that \"the resurrection will not arrive until \"al-Qa'im\" rises for the rights of our household\". Imam al-Baqir (a) is quoted as saying that \"when our al-Qa'im rises, God will put His hand on the heads of people, so that they can focus their thoughts\". The conflicts among some hadiths about the time of reappearance might be resolved by saying that some are concerned with the time of Zuhur or reappearance and some are concerned with the time of uprising. It is worth saying that some hadiths have talked about Imam al-Mahdi (a) 's reappearance and uprising as \"Khurūj\" (rising against the government). According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a): \"al-Qa'im's Khuruj (uprising) is certain\". Third stage (Imam al-Mahdi (a)'s Government) According to a hadith from the Prophet (s): \"the world does not come to an end until a man from my household will rise and govern like the household of Dawud \". According to another hadith from the Prophet (s): \"I give you good news about al-Mahdi , a man from Quraysh , by whose rule all the inhabitants of the heaven and the Earth are satisfied\". And in another hadith he is quoted as saying that \"a man from my people will rise and all people in the heaven and the Earth will love him\". Signs Signs of Reappearance ( علائم الظهور ) are those events which have been predicted by the Infallibles (a) to happen before or on the verge of the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the happening of each of them is considered a good news for approaching his uprising in the world; so that, he (a) will rise after the last in the series of these signs happen. The Siren , rising of Sufyani , etc. are among these signs. Time One question with which many people are concerned is when Imam al-Mahdi (a) will reappear and whether there is any specific time for his reappearance. According to hadiths from Imams (a), the time of his reappearance or Zuhur is unknown to people. Imam al-Sadiq (a) is quoted as saying that \"we never determined a time for the reappearance in the past, nor will we do so in the future\". Therefore, as emphasized in some hadiths, people who predict certain times for the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are imposters and liars. Imam al-Baqir (a) told one of his companions who asked him about the time of reappearance: \"people who determine times for the reappearance are liars; they lie, they lie\". These hadiths clarify that there were always people, with diabolical motivations, who determined times for Imam al-Mahdi (a)'s reappearance, as there will be such people in the future. Therefore, Imams (a) asked Shiites not to be indifferent to these people; rather they should reject and deny them. Imam al-Sadiq (a) told one of his companions: \"do not be afraid of rejecting a person who determines a time for the reappearance, since we have never determined a time for this\".

{"title": "Signs of Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Signs of Reappearance (Arabic: علامات الظهور , transliteration: 'Alamat al-Zuhur) are those events which have been predicted by the Infallibles (a) to happen before or on the verge of the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the happening of each of them is considered a good news for approaching his uprising in the world; so that, he (a) will rise after the last in the series of these signs happen. The Siren , rising of Sufyani , etc. are among these signs. Relation with 'Ashrat al-Sa'ah Since the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is considered among the events before the Judgment Day in religious sources, so some of the sign of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are also considered as Indications of the Hour ('Ashrat al-Sa'a). Number In religious sources, there are many natural, unnatural and socio-political events have been mentioned as the signs of reappearance . It is clear that the validity of all these signs is not the same. Some of the narrations mentioning these signs exist in authentic sources and they are authentic regarding the reference and argument. Some others are mentioned either in non-authentic books or by unreliable people. Some of these signs are just signs of reappearance and some are also signs before the Judgment Day. Some signs are general and essential and some others are details and minor issues which can be categorized under one title. What seems to be important is that frequency of these narrations assures us that on the verge of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) some events will occur, some of which will be significant and world-scale and some others are less important. However, there are some narrations which have mentioned some signs together. Types Signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are various and counting all of them is neither useful nor necessary; since, many of them are not definite signs of reappearance. Moreover, some of them have problems regarding reference and content and their authenticity is not clear. Therefore, in categorization of the signs, only the following criteria are considered here: Definite and Indefinite Among the signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), some have been mentioned as \"definite\" which are those, occurrence of which is definite without any precondition or prerequisite so that Imam al-Mahdi (a) will not return if they do not happen. From many narrations among which there are authentic hadiths , five signs can be found as definite: Rising of Sufyani , Rising of Yamani , Siren in the sky , murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya (the purified soul) and al-Khasf bi-l-Bayda' (Burying in Bayda). Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"five events are signs before the rising of the Riser (al-Qa'im): Siren in the sky, rising of Sufyani, Khasf bi-l-Bayda', rising of Yamani, murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya.\" There are also signs which are indefinite, i.e. they depend on other events to happen. In other words, indefinite signs may or may not happen before Imam al-Mahdi (a) comes. Some signs which have not been declared as definite are: Different causes of death Frequent earthquakes Wars and worldwide uprisings Unexpected lunar and solar eclipse Heavy rains Preceding and Non-preceding Based on some hadiths , some signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are just preceding to it so that there is not a long time between happening them and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Although, it is not clear how long is the time between happening them and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), but it is not long for sure and most probably such signs happen in the same year of reappearance or the year before it. Therefore, there is no doubt that some signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) happen near or just before reappearance of imam al-Mahdi (a) and there are some other signs which will happen in the period of the Major Occultation . Unusual Signs Happening of the signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is in a natural manner, but the prediction of some of them suggests that their happening is naturally impossible and they will happen as miracles such as rising of the sun from the West and the siren from sky which will be miracles if their apparent meanings are intended. However, they might have a figurative meaning and refer to events which naturally happen. It should be said that there are many narrations about the signs of reappearance, but their references are weak and unreliable and there is not firm reasoning connection between them. It seems that the great importance of the issue of Mahdism on the one hand, and the great interest of Muslims in knowing how future events and signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) happen on the other hand have made the enemies, especially cruel rulers, alter and distort in narrations in order to achieve their own political interests. Now we have a multitude of authentic and non-authentic narrations about reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), at least some of which have been altered and distorted. Unfortunately, there are also some books which either ignorantly or intentionally help this confusion. However, there are cases of forgery or distortion about the signs of reappearance or emerging False Claimants as a sign which can never invalidate all narrations or signs since some of them are definite and authentic. Ambiguity Some of the signs are clear regarding meaning and message, while some others are very ambiguous and complicated to understand. Many contemporary authors have mentioned these narrations and tried to interpret them based on their personal opinions. However, many of such authors do not have the scholarly competence to interpret these narrations and thus following such personal interpretations. A beneficial example is as follows: When discussing the signs of reappearance in al-Irshad , al-Shaykh al-Mufid writes, \"…and coming of Turks to the island and coming of Romans to the desert…\" Currently, Turks are in Iran , North of Iraq , Caucasus and Azerbaijan , so what does the phrase mean? And who are these Turks? What does \"the island\" mean? Today, Romans can include all the Europe and they even can include Americans since they immigrated from Europe. Also, words \"West\" or \"East\" have been mentioned in narrations and the question is what do they mean? Far East? Middle East? Far West? Or West of Arab countries including Libya , Tunisia , Algeria and Morocco ? In any case, it cannot definitely be said who or where the names in these narrations refer to today and it is needed to wait for the time to define these signs as there are.

{"title": "Siyahat-i gharb (book)", "text": "Siyahat-i Gharb (book) Author Aqa Najafi Quchani Original title Language Farsi Series 1 volume Subject Barzakh Genre Story Published First published in 1349 Sh/1970 Siyāḥat-i Gharb (Persian: سیاحت غرب , the journey to the west point of horizon) or Sarniwisht-i arwah pas az marg (Persian: سرنوشت ارواح پس از مرگ , lit. the fate of souls after death) is a famous Persian book in the form of story written by the Shi'a scholar, Aqa Najafi Quchani (b. 1295 /1878 - d. 1363 /1944). The narrative story in the book illustrates the journey of the soul after death in the world of Barzakh . The main structure and different stages of this journey reflect the conditions of Barzakh portrayed by the narrations of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Author Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hasan, known as Aqa Najafi, son of Muhammad Najafi was a graduate of Mashhad and Najaf seminaries. He has authored seven books most famous of which are: Siyhat-i Sharq and Siyahat-i Gharb . Siyahat-i Sharq (the journey to the east) deals with the social and political conditions of Iraq and Iran , during the age of Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Features of the Book The book is introduced by the author as his Barzakhi (related to afterlife ) observations and has been narrated from a first person perspective. The style corresponds to the writings of early 14th/19th century in which many Arabic and religious phrases are used. In the book, Qur'anic verses and hadiths are not translated into Persian. Story of Barzakh The story is narrated from a person who has died and starts from the moment he dies. After the ghusl , funeral and burial , the narrator talks about the questioning in the grave , and then he mentions the pressure of the grave . Different parts of the book have been formed based on the hadiths related to the world of Barzakh . Examples of punishment in the grave , particular punishments for certain forbidden acts and meeting with dead people, have been placed in the narrative. Use of Hadith and Qur'anic verses In different parts of the book, related Qur'anic verses and hadiths are reminded by the narrator of the story. Throughout the story, the author has tried to illustrate the role of Shi'a beliefs, particularly, the belief in the wilaya of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and love of Imam Ali (a) , in the afterlife. One example of such approach is a person called \"Hadi\" (lit. guide) who guides the narrator for the most part of the journey. The author introduces Hadi as the love of Imam Ali (a) which appears as a young good-looking man who helps and guides the dead person. Different kinds of moral and religious advices are made on proper occasions when the soul encounters certain difficulties or delights. Video Call in Barzakh One interesting part of the story is where Habib b. Muzahir , one of the companions of Imam al-Husayn (a) and Martyrs of Karbala , make a video call to the narrator of the story. The narrator says: \"The phone was of the kind that shows the person while talking\". Prints and Publications For the first time, Tabataba'i Publications published Siyahat-i Gharb in 1970. This print bore the explanations and comments of Ahmad Tadayyun and Muhammad Rida 'Ata'i Quchani. The book became a best-seller so the publisher had to issue its second print in 1972. Various publications have republished the book ever since. Movie In 2003, a movie was produced based on the story of Siyahat-i Gharb . Like its original book, the movie was very successful in terms of its popularity. It was introduced in its advertisement as some kind of hereafter-therapy. One of the features of this movie is that in some of its scenes, the Qur'anic verses related to the dialogues are displayed as subtitles. and The Divine Comedy is one of the classics of European literature and is composed by Dante. It pictures the scenes and stages of the afterlife based on Christian teachings. The book has three parts: Inferno (hell), Purgatorio (purgatory), and Paradiso (paradise). It is about an imaginary journey through these stages. On its way, the soul encounters wild beasts which represent lust, pride, and greed. The soul enters Inferno (hell) from which it is later rescued by lady Mary (a) and then enters Purgatory. It is important to know that Purgatory does not accurately equate to Barzakh in its Islamic traditional sense. However, according to Dante, passing through Purgatory is necessary for entering Paradise. There are similarities and differences between Aqa Quchani's Siyahat-i Gharb and Dane's Divine Comedy . One main similarity is that both works outline appalling pictures of vices and thus warn the readers and encourage them to do righteous deeds. Two of notable differences are: The styles of the two works are different; Unlike the Divine Comedy , Siyahat-i Gharb makes extensive and exclusive reliance on the verses of the Qur'an and the narrations from the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) .

{"title": "Tawassul", "text": " Tawassul , (Arabic: توسّل ) is one of the beliefs of Shi'a and most Muslims which means to resort to someone or something with a high position as an intermediary before God in order to become closer to Him so that He may fulfill one's requests. The concept of Tawassul is closely related to the concept of Shafa'a (intercession) and they are often mentioned together. Resorting to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) as an intermediary is among the prominent beliefs of Shi'a due to God's order in the Qur'an and many hadiths of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . It is mentioned in Shi'a supplications and ziyarah of the Infallible Ones (a), the most comprehensive one of which is Al-Tawassul Supplication . In the contemporary period, following Ibn Taymiyya , Wahhabis have mentioned criticisms about Tawassul which have been rejected by all Shi'a and most Sunni scholars. Meaning Tawassul is an infinitive from the root of \"w-s-l\" meaning to do something in order to become close to someone or something. In the technical sense of the term, it means to benefit from the good and righteous people close to God in order for supplications to be fulfilled. Through resorting, upon supplication , one presents something before God that is the means of acceptance of his repentance and fulfillment of supplication. The object of resorting is the person or thing that is respectable before God; such as God's attributes or names, the name of The the Holy Prophet (s) , his supplication, the name of great friends of God and angels and the request can be a religious and spiritual issue or a material or worldly need. \"Wasila\" (Arabic: وسیلة , means) is what or whom is benefited by one to become close to God. Thus, as it is mentioned in Shi'a narrations, Wasila can refer to a wide range of means which can include religious obligations and recommended actions, the supplications of the faithful and even the friends of God. Arguments for Tawassul To prove the legitimacy of Tawassul, researchers have referred to different evidences from the Qur'an, hadith and sira. Some also believe that, in addition to its legitimacy and desirability according to shari'a, Tawassul is rooted in human's nature and rationality. In the Qur'an The concept of Tawassul and resorting to a means is adopted from the Qur'an . The clearest reference to Tawassul is mentioned in Sura al-Ma'ida where God clearly orders the faithful to benefit from the means in order to become close to God. “ O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah , and seek the means of recourse to Him, and wage jihad in His way, so that you may be felicitous. ” — The Qur'an , 5:35 Also, in verse 64 of the Sura al-Nisa' , sinners are advised that they come to the Prophet (s) and ask him to ask God for their forgiveness so that God forgive them. “ And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, [O Muhammad], and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful. ” — The Qur'an , 4:64 Also, when Prophet Joseph's (a) brothers became regretful, instead of asking God for forgiveness, asked their father's intercession and asked him to ask God for their forgiveness. “ They said, \"O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners. ” — The Qur'an , 12:97 Also, in another verse, servants are required to hold fast, all together, to Allah's cord. In this verse, according to Shi'a narrations, by \"Allah's cord\", the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) are meant. “ Hold fast, all together, to Allah's cord, and do not be divided [into sects]. ” — The Qur'an , 3:103 In Hadiths There are many hadiths about Tawassul, where the meaning of Tawassul, the examples of Wasila and its fruits are explained. In a hadith from Lady Fatima (a) , it is mentioned that, \"Everything in the sky and on the earth seek a Wasila [means] through which they become close to God and we are God's means and intermediaries among His creation.\" [5] Imam al-Sadiq (a) has said that, \"We ( Ahl al-Bayt (a) ) are the Allah's cord about which God Almighty has said, \"Hold fast, all together, to Allah's cord, and do not be divided [into sects].\" (3:103) [6] Also according to hadiths, after Prophet Adam (a) was dismissed from the Paradise , he (a) was forgiven by God through resorting to the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). [7] Previous prophets (a) resorted to the position of the Prophet (s) as well. [8] In a hadith, Imam 'Ali (a) has mentioned the examples of Wasila; among which are belief in God, Jihad in the way of God and doing the obligations, fasting , hajj and 'Umra . [9] In addition to hadiths, Ziyarah texts [addresses given upon visiting shrines] and supplications received from the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are full of the instances of Tawassul and swearing in the rights of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) which are examples of Tawassul. [10] Hadiths regarding permissibility of practicing Tawassul are not only narrated by Shi'a but also narrated by Sunnis ; including the one in which, a blind man regained his sight through Tawassul to the Prophet (s), or another hadith that Aisha has narrated from the Prophet (s) saying that \"Imam Ali (a) is the closest Wasila to God.\" Conduct of Muslims Conduct of Muslims of early Islam and the companions of the Prophet (s) show that resorting to the righteous and virtuous is an acceptable and desirable action. In this regard, some examples can be mentioned as below: 'Umar 's Entreaty to 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib upon asking for rain. [13] Safiyya 's entreaty to the Prophet (s) by composing elegies for him. [14] A man's entreaty to the Prophet (s) at the time of 'Uthman by the guidance of 'Uthman b. Hunayf [15] and resorting of Bilal b. Harith to the Prophet (s) to ask for rain. [16] According to the Zayni Dahlan, studying the supplications of the people of the past shows many examples of their entreaties. [17] Ibn Hajar al-Haytami has mentioned some poems of Shafi'i in which the household of the Prophet (s) have openly been introduced as the means to reach near God. [18] According to a narration, in a conversation with Mansur Dawaniqi , Malik b. Anas taught him the way of visiting the grave of the noble Prophet (s) and resort to him. [19] Kinds of Wasila One cannot use any means to become close to God, e.g. for this purpose, using fire or idol is forbidden because Islam's permission to use fire as Wasila is not proved and also prohibition of using idols is proved in religion. However, to know what are considered as Wasila, one needs to refer to hadiths and traditions. Here, there can be a categorization of Tawassul to legitimate and illegitimate, since if one uses a Wasila which is not approved by God to become close to God, he suffers from illegitimate Tawassul; even when making Tawassul to other than idols cannot be considered as polytheism . Some of the issues which have been mentioned as Wasila to become close to God in narrations of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are as follows: Belief in One God and the Prophet (s) Jihad in the way of God Ikhlas (Sincerity) Establishing the Prayer Paying Zakat Fasting the month of Ramadan Hajj and 'Umra Caring for one's kin Giving charity , covertly and overtly The Qur'an God's names and attributes Making Tawassul to the faithful's prayers and du'as Making Tawassul to the Prophet's (s) du'as Making Tawassul to the Prophet (s) himself, Infallible Imams (a) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) Good and righteous deeds Wahhabi's Questions Tawassul is approved by most Muslims , whether Shi'a or Sunni ; Wahhabis have denied and criticized Tawassul; some of their critics are as follow: Tawassul and Tawhid The first criticism Wahhabis make about Tawassul is that Tawassul contradicts the unity of God because the servant should only ask God for help and asking other than God is polytheism . To prove illegitimacy of Tawassul, Ibn Taymiyya has sometimes referred to verses of the Qur'an , including verses 56 and 57 of Sura al-Isra' : “ Say, Invoke those whom you claim [to be gods] besides Him. They have no power to remove your distress nor to bring about any change [in your state]. They [themselves] are the ones who supplicate, seeking a recourse to their Lord, whoever is nearer [to Him], expecting His mercy and fearing His punishment. Indeed your Lord's punishment is a thing to beware of. ” — Qur'an 17 :56-57 and “ You [alone] do we worship, and to You [alone] do we turn for help. ” — Qur'an 1 :5 However, looking carefully, one finds no relation between these verses and Tawassul, since they are about rejection of the lordship of the polytheists' gods and their incompetence for being worshiped and they have no relation with resorting to holy means in order to become close to God. Also, verse 5 of the Sura al-Fatiha rejects asking help from other than God, believing in the means independently, not rejecting asking God through the means; just like in the noble Qur'an, seeking helps from the prayer and other things are mentioned. Intellectually, making Tawassul never requires polytheism; since firstly, asking help from someone or something does not mean worshiping that person or thing. The system of creation is based on the mutual effects of things and means over each other and of course, they receive their effects from God and none of them can make any influence independently. Since, seeking help from material means and people is not polytheism as we do not believe in their independence, using non-material means, if we believe in their dependence, would not be polytheism. Believing in the unity of God requires that while one benefits from the means, he is aware about their origins and dependence to God of the world and this is the belief in the unity of God. In addition to above references, some other verses of the Qur'an have been referred to for justifying the impermissibility of Tawassul including verse 3 of Sura al-Zumar : “ Look! [Only] exclusive faith is worthy of Allah, and those who take guardians besides Him [claiming,] 'We only worship them so that they may bring us near to Allah,' Allah will indeed judge between them concerning that about which they differ. Indeed Allah does not guide someone who is a liar and an ingrate. ” — Qur'an 39 :3 And verse 37 of Sura Saba' : “ It is not your wealth, nor your children, that will bring you close to Us in nearness, except those who have faith and act righteously. It is they for whom there will be a twofold reward for what they did, and they will be secure in lofty abodes. ” — Qur'an 34 :37 But the first verse (39:3), only rejects worshiping anything other than God, not becoming close to God through resorting to the righteous without being worshiped. About the second verse (34:37), resorting to the Prophets (a) and friends of God is mentioned among righteous deeds. Making Tawassul to the Prophet (s) after his Demise Ibn Taymiyya said that benefiting from du'as of the Prophet (s) and the righteous is permissible only during their lifetimes and after they pass away, they cannot do anything and resoring to them is not permissible. However, this idea of Ibn Taymiyya contradicts with the Islamic idea of life after death . The life of prophets (a) and the friends of God continues after they move on to the world of Barzakh (middle world). It is obvious that the prophets (a), who have higher positions than the martyrs , will continue their lives after this world. Moreover, from the Islamic viewpoint, death is not the end and destruction of human being, but moving from one world to another. The same as one can ask the Prophet (s) to make du'a and ask God for the person's forgiveness during his lifetime, he (s) can be asked for the same request after he (a) has passed away; since, according to the Qur'an and traditions, connection between one living in this world and souls of the people in Barzakh is possible. The dialogues between the two prophets Salih (a) and Shu'ayb (a) with their perished people, the fact that God orders His Prophet (s) in the Qur'an to speak with the previous prophets (a), and the conversation of the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) with those who were killed in the battles of Badr and Jamal are evidences for the above claim. Tawassul and Bid'a Considering Tawassul as Bid'a (impermissible innovation) is a claim of Ibn Taymiyya and Wahhabis. From the viewpoint of the school of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and with the many authentic hadiths , du'as and ziyarahs narrated from the Infallibles (a) about making Tawassul to the position of them, it is obvious that the claim of Wahhabis and Ibn Taymiyya is not plausible. Moreover, studying the conducts of Muslims and even non-Shi'ites proves that after the demise of the Prophet (s) , they did make Tawassul to the noble Prophet (s) the same as they made Tawassul to his du'as during his lifetime; about which there are stories mentioned about Imam 'Ali (a) and Abu Bakr . Accordingly, the following stories can be mentioned: 'Umar 's resorting 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib to perform the prayer for raining ( Istisqa' ), the Prophet's (s) aunt, Safiyya 's resorting to him by reciting some poems in his demise, a man's resorting to the Prophet (s) at the time of 'Uthman 's caliphate using 'Uthman b. Hunayf 's advice and Bilal b. Harith 's resorting to the Prophet (s) to pray for raining. According to Zayni Dahlan , studying du'as and prayers of Muslims in the past, shows many of their cases of Tawassul. Al-Haythami has mentioned some poems of Shafi'i in which the Ahl al-Bayt (a) have clearly been mentioned as the means to become close to God. According to a report, in a conversation between Malik b. Anas and al-Mansur al-Dawaniqi , Malik b. Anas taught al-Mansur how to visit the grave of the noble Prophet (s) and make Tawassul to him. Even if the authenticity of some Sunni narrations about Tawassul is not proved, many of them show that such practice of Tawassul has been common since the time of the Companions and later periods and has been regarded as an authentic principle. Al-Samhudi tells different stories about those who made Tawassul to the Prophet (s) near his shrine and their requests were answered. Manner of Tawassul in Ziyarahs and Du'as Studying Tawassul and the literature used for it in du'as and Ziyarahs narrated from the Imams (a) helps an authentic understanding of the permissible Tawassul. Making Tawassul to the Imams (a) and the friends of God exists almost in all Shi'a du'as and Ziyarahs of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a). Also, especial prayers are mentioned to make Tawassul to the Prophet (s) or each of the Imams (a) in the books of supplications, the most important one of which is al-Tawassul supplication , some phrases of which are as follows: O God, I ask You and turn towards You through Your Prophet (s) of mercy O Prophet of Allah (s), … We turn to and ask for Shafa'a from God through you and place you before our requests, O the one, who is honored before God, Make Shafa'a for us before God! To swear God in the rights of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) and the righteous is one of the permissible ways of Tawassul; such as saying, \"O Allah, I ask You in the position of Muhammad\" or \"O Allah, I surly ask You in the rights of all the faithful who praised him in it.\" In Shi'a Culture Although Tawassul is accepted among all Muslims , but due to its special position in Shi'a culture, special manners and rituals have been associated with it. Some of such rituals are: visiting the graves of Imams (a) and the righteous, spreading food tables in the name of Imams (a) such as the table of Imam Zayn al-'Abidin (a) or the table of Abu al-Fadl (a) when in a session, people are given food and they recite the Qur'an and du'as and present its rewards to that Imam (a) and make Tawassul to him. Holding gatherings to recite Du'a al-Tawassul in congregation is another common ritual among Shi'a which is usually held in the eve of Wednesdays in mosques , shrines of Imams (a) and even in houses.

{"title": "Barzakh", "text": " Barzakh (Arabic: بَرزَخ ) is a world between this world and hereafter ; it is also called the imaginal world or the world of grave . Brazakh exists for both believers and non-believers, though it is similar to the Heaven for the former, and similar to the Hell for non-believers. Meaning 'Barzakh' in Arabic literally means an interval or a barrier between two things, and technically it means an interval between the end of this-worldly life (death) and the beginning of hereafter. The world is called 'Barzakh' because it is an interval between this world and the hereafter. The world is also called the world of grave and the imaginal world. In the Qur'an The word 'Barzakh' has been mentioned three times in the Qur'an . but only in Qur'an 23 :100 it has been used in the meaning in question: “ حَتَّى إِذَا جَاء أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ (۹۹) لَعَلِّی أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِیمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّا إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَائِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى یوْمِ یبْعَثُونَ \"When death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord! Take me back (99) that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.' 'By no means! These are mere words that he says.' And ahead of them is a Barzakh until the day they will be resurrected.\" ” — Qur'an, Qur'an 23:99-100 According to this verse of the Qur'an, the request of some people at the time of their death to return to the world in order to do the good deeds that they have not done is not in place, and they face a barrier or an interval—a Barzakh—until the Day of Judgment . The phrase \"until the day they will be resurrected\" indicates that Barzakh is an interval between this world and the hereafter, that anyone experiences after their death and before the Day of Judgment. Proof in the Qur'an In addition to verse 100 of Qur'an 23 that explicitly shows the existence of Barzakh, some verses prove Barzakh without mentioning the word 'Barzakh'. These verses concern the life of martyrs after their deaths: And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their lord. [5] And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive. [6] Moreover, according to Qur'anic verses, Barzakh is not restricted to martyrs—a sinner like Pharaoh and his friends also experience Barzakh: In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the day that judgment will be established: 'cast ye the people of pharaoh into the severest penalty! ( Qur'an 23 :46) [7] The verse obviously points to a penalty for Pharaoh and his people before the penalties of the Day of Judgment, and that is the penalty in Barzakh. In Hadiths Definition In some hadiths , the word 'Barzakh' is used to mean an interval between this world and the hereafter. For instance, according a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , all (true) Shiites will go to the Heaven in the hereafter, and, the hadith goes on, 'I swear to God that I fear about you in Barzakh'. A person asked him about Barzakh, and Imam answered: '[it is] the grave, from one's death to the Day of Judgment'. This latter statement implies that the world of grave is the world of Barzakh —indeed, grave in this hadith does not mean a certain hole in the earth; it is a metaphor for Barzakh. Barzakh's Heaven and Hell Some hadiths state that the world of Barzakh has its own heaven and hell in which people are rewarded or punished for their deeds. The Prophet (s) says: \"the grave is either a garden of heaven or a hole of hell\". Question of the Grave A number of hadiths show that once people enter the world of Barzakh, they are questioned about their beliefs and deeds. This questioning is known as \"the question of the grave\". Barzakhi Body Human soul attaches to an imaginal or Barzakhi body. An imaginal body is one that is not of a material kind, and yet enjoys some characteristics of material objects, such as shape and size. In these respects, the imaginal body is like a person's natural body. In order to have a clear picture of an imaginal or Barzakhi body, one might reflect on the forms or images that one observes while dreaming. Such forms are undoubtedly non-material; they do not occupy any space and they do not have any mass, and yet they have a shape and a size and they have forms like those of material objects.

{"title": "Tatayur al-Kutub", "text": " Taṭāyur al-kutub (Arabic: تطایر الکتب ) is a stage of the resurrection in which one observes the book, or record, of his or her actions. This is an Islamic belief, emphasized by hadiths . Following some hadiths, exegetes of the Qur'an take the term to be derived from the Qur'an 17 :13 and 14, and some Muslim jurists take it obligatory to believe in Tatayur al-kutub. Lexicology The word \"tatayur\" literally means to fly, to disseminate, and to dispense. Although the word \"tatayur\" does not appear in the Qur'an, following some hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) , Qur'anic exegetes take the term to be derived from the Qur'an: \"every man's 'tayir' (bird or fate) we have fastened on his own neck\", followed by \"read your book (or records)\". Exegesis Qur'anic exegetes suggested two interpretations of the word \"ta'ir\" in the above Qur'anic verse: First: the word \"ta'ir\" (Arabic: طائر ) has its root in the word \"tayr\" (Arabic: طیر ) which means bird. Arabs used to fly a bird in order to know whether what they sought to do was good or bad. Later the good and bad actions themselves came to be called \"ta'ir\". Second: according to Abu 'Ubayda, by \"ta'ir\" Arabs meant fortune. In the verse immediately after the above verse, we read that the same \"ta'ir\" displays the book of people's actions to them on the Day of Judgment . According to some hadiths, this stage of the resurrection is called \"tatayur al-kutub\" or \"tatayur al-suhuf\". According to a hadith narrated from the Prophet (s) by Aisha , there are three stages of the resurrection in which one does not know or remember anyone: mizan (the measurement of one's good and bad actions), tatayur al-kutub or tatayur al-suhuf, and sirat (the bridge that everyone should pass in the resurrection). According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , \"ta'ir\" refers to the good and the evil that always accompany one until the Day of Judgment when the book of one's actions is given to him or her. Therefore, divine agents ( angels ) record one's actions—good and bad—in this world, and they open the record—the book—to the person after the resurrection, at the stage of tatayur al-kutub. Theologians and jurists take it obligatory for a Muslim to believe in 'tatayur al-kutub' as a stage of the resurrection, because it was mentioned in the Qur'an. Thus jurists maintain that it is one of the doctrines that should be mentioned to a dead person at the time of talqin .

{"title": "Embodiment of Actions", "text": " Embodiment of Actions (Arabic: تَجَسُّمُ الأَعْمال ), incarnation of actions or symbolization of actions is an expression in Islamic philosophy and theology meaning the embodiment of human actions in front of them on the Day of Judgment . It means that people's good deeds in this world will take form in the hereafter as heavenly blessings, while bad deeds will take form as fire, chains ,and different forms of punishment . Since it is a good explanation of the relation between action and its reward, this teaching is very important in discussions regarding the hereafter and scholars of theology, philosophy and exegesis have always discussed it. Mulla Sadra was among the advocates of the embodiment of actions and al-'Allama al-Majlisi was among its critics. Although there are different views about embodiment of actions, but after Mulla Sadra could present better explanations about embodiment of actions, it was welcomed by a majority of scholars. Meaning of the Embodiment of Actions According to the principle of the embodiment of actions, reward and punishment of people's good or bad deeds is not something other than those deeds themselves and the deeds and their rewards are related in creation and an outside agent of punishment is non-existent; for example, if it has been said that the punishment for a sin is the hellfire , that fire is nothing separate from that sin, but it is rather the reality of that sin which will be embodied and appear as fire. Everything people do, whether good or bad has a form in this world and a form in the hereafter which is hidden in the essence of that action and on the Day of Resurrection , it will lost its form in this world and will appear in its form in the hereafter and causes happiness and pleasure or sadness and grief. Beside the embodiment of actions, the issue of the embodiment of intentions or states of the soul have been discussed as well, which means that the true appearance of human being depends on those intentions, qualities and states of his soul. Therefore, although people are similar in form but they are different regarding spiritual appearance i.e. qualities and states. Embodiment of Actions in the Qur'an and Hadiths The concept of the embodiment of actions can be found in many verse of the Qur'an as well as in hadiths . In the glorious Qur'an, there are verses suggesting that on the Day of Judgment , anyone will see his actions themselves, such as: \"On that day, mankind will issue forth in various groups to be shown their deeds.* So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,* and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it. \"The day when every soul will find present whatever good it has done\" Of course there are other verses which suggest the legal nature (not in creation) of punishment and the existence of outside agents of punishment including: \"So that Allah may reward every soul for what it has earned. Indeed Allah is swift at reckoning. \"If You punish them, they are indeed Your creatures; but if You forgive them, You are indeed the All-mighty, the All-wise.\" Also, in some hadiths, embodiment of actions has been explicitly mentioned; for example, the noble Prophet (s) addressed one of the companions : \"Surly, you will have companions buried with you in the grave. If it is honorable, it will make you honorable and if it is dishonorable, it will make you so. It will not be resurrected unless with you and you will not be resurrected unless with it. You will not be questioned unless with it, so make it honorable, because if it is worthy and good, you will love it and if it is unworthy and corrupt, you will just be afraid of it and it is your deed.\" Also Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"when God resurrects a believer from grave , a symbolical being comes out of the grave and goes before him. The believer tells him, \"who are you?\" he answers, \"I am the happiness and joy you made in your brother. God created me to bring you good news.\" In these two hadiths, appearing deeds in symbolical forms have been clearly stated. Critics to Embodiment of Actions These verses and narrations have made different opinions to be presented about rewards of actions. Some scholars considered verses in contradiction with embodiment as fundamental and interpreted the verses suggesting embodiment so that they do not have any contradiction with the verses in contradiction with embodiment; for example, in the verse mentioned from the Qur'an 99 , most commentators, especially the early ones, interpreted \"to be shown their deeds\" as seeing the rewards of their deeds or the report of their actions, not their deeds themselves. Most early commentators supported this view. Some of these commentators including Fakhr al-Razi and al-Tabrisi defended this interpretation saying that, actions are accidental properties and they are not permanent and their return is impossible; thus, saying that actions themselves will be embodied is wrong. Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi was also among critics of the embodiment of actions. His justification is that the embodiment of actions is in contradiction with the belief in Bodily Resurrection . He disapproved al-Shaykh al-Baha'i 's view and suggested that believing in the embodiment of actions will lead to denial of Islam . This opinion caused a serious reaction from the advocates of the embodiment of actions. Advocates of the Embodiment of Actions On the opposite side, most contemporary commentators and theologians have accepted the verses regarding the embodiment of actions as they are understood literally without any extra interpretation, including al-Shaykh al-Baha'i who did not consider reward for actions, a presumption in interpreting verse 6 of Sura al-Zilzal, and believed that actions themselves will be seen. He was among serious advocates of the embodiment of actions, and in this regard, refers to the mentioned verses and different narrations – which he says both supporters and critics have narrated. He says that the serpents and scorpions promised for the hell are the reprehensible actions, beliefs and morals which will be represented as such, while virgins and the green and as such are righteous acts, beliefs and morals and this difference in representations is due to the difference in gradation. Before al-Shaykh al-Baha'i, this view had advocates among mystics including Rumi . Mulla Sadra and Explanation of the Issue in Transcendental Philosophy Using his principles in Transcendental Philosophy , Sadr al-Muta'allihin could propose better explanations about the embodiment of actions, so that after him, this belief received approval of the majority. He brought up issues such as the essential movement , corporal resurrection , unity of the intellectual and the intellect and presented a special intellectual framework and tried to make a rational explanation of the embodiment of actions. According to Mulla Sadra, the same way material things influence the mind, mental things influence material things as well. The influence of material things on other material things and mental things are not the same; for example, wet things in contact with non-wet things make them wet, but when imagined, does not make imagination wet, but makes an imaginary form of itself there and when thought of, forms a general intellectual form in the mind. Thus, one reality can make different influences in different places. Moreover, a state like anger which is a mental state can be manifested outside in a materialistic form such as redness of the cheeks or rapid heartbeat. Thus, it is not impossible that this anger would be manifested as fire. Humans' actions can turn into spiritual states and dispositions, i.e. it might be manifested in non-corporal form. In the hereafter too, the same spiritual states and dispositions can turn into that world forms. After Mulla Sadra, this theory received many supporters including al-Fayd al-Kashani and Mulla Hadi Sabziwari . Among contemporary scholars, too, critics and advocates of this view have spoken. However, some contemporary scholars believe that accepting the embodiment of actions has no contradiction with accepting the existence of punishments and rewards of legal nature, since some verses in the Qur'an (some examples of which were mentioned) appear to mean so and there is no problem in believing both.

{"title": "Heaven", "text": "Heaven or al-Janna (Arabic: الجنة ) is, according to Muslims , a place in the Afterlife where righteous and prosperous people will reside and enjoy divine blessings. The place where Adam (a) and Eve lived before their fall (hubut) to the Earth, is also referred to as \"al-Janna\". There are over two hundred verses of the Qur'an as well as many hadiths from the Infallibles (a) with regard to the Heaven and its features, such as its vastness, the number of Heavens, variety and features of its blessings, things in the Heaven, the purpose of the creation, the characteristics of its residents, characters and actions that make one deserve to reside in the Heaven, people who are deprived of the Heaven, and the relationship between residents of the Heaven. Although the belief in the Heaven is a crucial Islamic doctrine, there are disagreements among Muslim theologians over whether the Heaven will be created in the Afterlife or it is already created. Moreover, Muslim scholars, both Shi'as and Sunnis , dispute over whether the Heaven and its blessings are corporeal or spiritual. The Notion and Related Terms The Heaven is a place in the Afterlife where righteous and prosperous people will reside and enjoy divine blessings. In Qur'an There are over two hundred Qur'anic verses and many hadiths from the Infallibles (a) with regard to the Heaven. Here are the themes of Qur'anic verses regarding the Heaven: features of the Heaven, its main characteristics, the vastness and the type of its space, variety of its blessings, features of its blessings, purpose of the creation of the Heaven, what makes people deserve the Heaven, what deprives people of the Heaven, and finally, the relationship between the residents of the Heaven. In addition to emphasizing the end of the world and occurrence of the resurrection and the beginning of a new life in the Afterlife , the Qur'an refers to the Heaven in different ways: 1-\"Jannat\" (literally meaning the garden; its plural form is: \"Jannāt\", الجنات ): it has occurred over 100 times in the Qur'an. It is sometimes used with another noun or adjective, such as \"Jannat al-Khuld\" ( جنّة الخلد , the Garden of Eternity), \"Jannat al-Na'im\" ( جنة النعیم , the Garden of Bliss), \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\" ( جنّة المأوی , the Garden of Abode), \"Jannāt 'Adn\" ( جنّاتُ عدن , Gardens of Eden), and \"Jannāt al-Firdaws\" ( جنّات الفردوس , Gardens of Paradise). 2-\"Rawḍa\" ( روضة , Garden): in Qur'an 30 :15. 3-\"Rawḍāt al-Jannāt\" ( روضات الجنات , Meadows of Gardens): in Qur'an 42 :22. 4-\"Firdaws\" ( فردوس , Paradise): in Qur'an 23 :11. 5-\"Dār al-Salām\" ( دارالسلام , Home of Peace): in Qur'an 6 :127 and Qur'an 10 :25. It is a name and a feature of the Heaven. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, since \"Salam\" (Peace) is a Divine Name, \"Dar al-Salam\" means the Home of God , which shows the value of the Heaven. 6-\"Dār al-Ākhira\" ( دارالآخرة , Home of the Hereafter ): it occurs nine times in the Qur'an. 7-\"Dār al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , Home of Eternity): in Qur'an 41 :28. 8-\"Dār al-Muqāma\" ( دارَالْمُقامه , Home of Everlasting Dwelling): in Qur'an 35 :35. 9-\"Dār al-Qarār\" ( دارُالْقرار , Enduring Home): in Qur'an 40 :39. 10-\"Dār al-Muttaqīn\" ( دارُالْمتّقین , Home of the Pious): in Qur'an 16 :30. 11-\"Maqām 'Amīn\" ( مَقامٍ امین , Secure Place): in Qur'an 44 :51. 12-\"Maq'ad Sidq\" ( مقعدِ صدق , Seat of Truth): in Qur'an 54 :55. 13-\"'Illīyyūn/'Illīyyīn\" ( علّیین/ علّیون , High Place): in Qur'an 83 :18-19. 14-\"Ḥusnā\" ( حُسنی , the Best): in Qur'an 10 :26 and other verses. Abd Allah b. Abbas is quoted as saying that each of the phrases, \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\", \"Jannat al-Na'im\", \"Dar al-Khuld\" or \"Jannat al-Khuld\", \"Dar al-Salam\", \"Jannat al-Firdaws\", \"Janna 'Adn\" and \"Dar al-Jalal\" refers to a particular heaven. In his collection of hadiths, Bihar al-anwar , al-Allama al-Majlisi cited Qur'anic verses concerning \"Jannat\" (which are about 275) in the order of the Qur'anic suras , and then cited their exegeses from al-Tabrisi , al-Fakhr al-Razi , and al-Baydawi . In Hadiths In some hadiths from the Infallibles (a) , the names of the Heaven in the Qur'an are explained; for example: 1-According to a hadith from the Prophet Muhammad (s) , \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\" is the name of a river in the Heaven. And \"Jannat 'Adn\" and \"Jannat al-Firdaws\" are names of two heavens in the middle of two other heavens. 2-According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the Qur'an has mentioned four heavens; Jannat 'Adn, Firdaws, Na'im, and Ma'wa, while there are many heavens around these four heavens. 3-According to a hadith transmitted by Su'ayd b. Janah from Imam al-Baqir (a), the Qur'an 55 :46 and 62, are evidences for the existence of four heavens. One of the two heavens in the former verse is a reward for abstaining from sins , and the other is a result of fearing to stand before God (people who are very close to God) and the two heavens referred to in Qur'an 55:62 (Na'im and Ma'wa) belong to Companions of the Right Hand : these heavens are closer to God, though there is less bliss there. 4-According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Qur'an 55:62 is evidence for there being numerous heavens, and the term, \"darajāt\" (degrees), reveals differences between residents of the Heaven with respect to their rankings. 5-According to some Shiite and Sunni hadiths, there is a heaven which is directly created by God and its trees are directly planted by Him; its sceneries are never seen by anyone and its bliss is not known by anyone. Some exegetes of the Qur'an take the verse seventeen of Qur'an 32 to refer to this heaven. In a hadith, Imam al-Sadiq (a) talked about God's manifestation for residents of the Heaven and then referred to this particular heaven. There are hadiths in many Shiite and Sunni collections to the effect that there is a heaven whose bounties are beyond human imaginations. Features and Characteristics Some features of the Heaven are mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) . According to the Qur'an, the Heaven is a place where prosperous people reside in the Afterlife : gardens with many green and dense trees with rivers streaming beneath them, springs, various fruits, and a moderate temperature. According to the Qur'an 3 :133 and the Qur'an 57 :21, the Heaven is as wide as the skies and the Earth. Exegetes of the Qur'an such as al-Tabrisi , al-Fakhr al-Razi and Allama Tabataba'i , have appealed to these verses to show that it is beyond the human mind to conceive the vastness of the Heaven. The Heaven is Corporeal and already Created Some hadiths have pointed out that the Heaven is created before the occurrence of the resurrection . It has been known as a Shiite belief. There is a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) according to which the Heaven is created in the sense that it has an external existence, and that the Prophet (s) saw the real Heaven in his Mi'raj . Thus, if someone rejects that the Heaven is created, they will thereby deny the Prophet (s). Some hadiths have emphasized that for every person there is a specific, predetermined place in the Heaven as well as in the Hell . A person's actions gradually build up that place in the Heaven or the Hell during time. Such hadiths have been appealed to for the existence of the Heaven and the Hell right now. The Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) emphasize that the Heaven, and in general, the Afterlife, are corporeal or physical. Thus, there is no difference between this mundane world and the Afterlife with respect to their being physical. They are different in other respects. Al-Allama al-Majlisi and Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri have appealed to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) to show that the states of the Afterlife should be measured with those of this world. They maintain that this doctrine implies the corporeality of the Heaven. In response to a question by 'Imran al-Sabi and as an argument for the invisibility of God for human beings in the Heaven, Imam al-Rida (a) said that one can argue for what happens in the Heaven only by what happens in this world. According to the interpretation of al-Allama al-Majlisi and his student, Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri, this implies the principle that the states of the Afterlife should be measured with those of this world. Theological Arguments In order to show that the Heaven is created, scholars have appealed to some verses of the Qur'an : the Qur'an 53 :5 which is a report of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj , the Qur'an 3 :133 and the Qur'an 57 :21 both of which state that the Heaven is \"prepared\", and the Qur'an 9 :100 which says that God has prepared the Heaven, and thus implies that the Heaven and the Hell actually exist right now. In some hadiths from the Imams of Shi'a , it is explicitly stated that the Heaven already exists. Imam al-Rida (a) has appealed to the story of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj to show its existence. Ibn Hazm and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya have also appealed to some accounts of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj to show that the Heaven is already created. On the contrary, people who believe that the Heaven and the Hell are not created yet have appealed to rational and transmitted evidence. The oldest rational argument is that it is vain to create the Heaven before the resurrection. Some theologians have replied to this argument by saying that the reason for all God's actions need not be known for people, and thus, we cannot hold that the creation of the Heaven before the resurrection is vain from our own perspectives. Esoteric Interpretation of the Corporeal Heaven in the Batini View In accordance with their philosophical methodology, the Batiniyya have provided esoteric interpretations ( ta'wil ) of Qur'anic verses which imply the corporeality, and other features, of the Heaven, taking them to be symbolic. In an explicit objection to them, al-Ghazali maintained that this approach implies that the Prophet (s) was ignorant or, at least, their approach is at odds with the explicit text of the religion and is, thus, against Islam , especially because there are many Qur'anic verses regarding the Heaven and the Afterlife. It has been assumed that the belief in the existence of the Heaven with the features mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths is an essential component of Islam, and thus, the interpretation of Qur'anic verses in a way that leads to the denial of the Heaven's corporeality amounts to the denial of Islam. Muslim theologians do not permit any esoteric interpretation or symbolic construal of religious texts, such as the corporeality of the Heaven in the Qur'an, except when there is a rational dilemma. Sulayman b. Salih al-Ghusn holds that doctrines, such as the corporeality of the Heaven, are rationally plausible and there is a transmitted agreement over them, and thus, it is not permissible to provide an esoteric interpretation of them which leads, say, to the denial of the Heaven's corporeality. The Blessings In the Islamic culture, Divine Satisfaction and His happiness is considered as the highest blessing of the Heaven. Moreover, many various blessings, such as foods, drinks, houses, gardens, palaces, clothes, and the like, have been mentioned in different suras of the Qur'an, such as Qur'an 55 , Qur'an 56 , Qur'an 76 , and some verses of other suras . Divine Satisfaction: According to Islamic hadiths , Divine Satisfaction is the highest blessing of the Heaven. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) to the effect that when people of the Heaven begin to reside in their places, they are told that beyond the blessings they are given is the Divine Satisfaction and His love of them. After this, Imam Ali (a) cited the verse 72 of Qur'an 9 according to which, \"what is greater than all of this is that God is pleased with them\". According to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , the least blessed people in the Heaven are those who are concerned with the bliss of the Heaven, and the most blessed—who are very valuable for God—are those who are concerned with the Divine Presence or Face every morning and evening. Foods and drinks: the Qur'an has emphasized most of all on fruits in the Heaven. According to Qur'anic verses, every type of fruit can always be found in the Heaven in abundance, and they can be easily picked from the trees. The Qur'an has twice pointed to the meat and the flesh of birds as bounties of the Heaven. The Qur'an 47 :15 points to drinks of the Heaven: streams of water, milk, wine, and honey, cups of very pleasant and white wine mixed with the aroma of camphor or ginger from a spring called \" Salsabil \", or mixed with musk. The words, \"sharab\" (drink) and \"sharab tahur\" (pure drink) in the Qur'an also refer to drinks of the Heaven. The Qur'an has emphasized that the wine of the Heaven is free of the problems of the wine of this world (such as intoxication, headache, inclination to sins, and dementia). Clothes: other blessings of the Heaven include silk and dibaj clothes, golden, silver, and pearl bracelets, silk and brocade carpets with gorgeous, tall pillows, golden trays, silver dishes, crystal cups, with young and handsome servants. Marriage: another blessing of the Heaven is the bond of marriage which is referred to in the Qur'an as \"pure spouses\", \"your spouses\", and \"We make them spouses\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have appealed to the Qur'an 13 :23 and Qur'an 40 :8 to show that spouses who are both believers in this world will live together in the Heaven as well. And if parents and children are all righteous, they will be in the Heaven together (the Qur'an 36 :56 and the Qur'an 43 :70). Moreover, the Qur'an has pointed to \"hur\" (once) and \"hur 'in\" (white women with black eyes, three times) and their marriage with people of the Heaven. According to the Qur'an, these women are beautiful and fresh, chaste, and far from any lustful look. Eye-catching things: in the Qur'an 43:71, it is said that everything eye-catching—whatever pleases the eyes—can be found in the Heaven and every desire is satisfied there. Some exegetes have appealed to these phrases to show that the blessings of the Heaven mentioned in the Qur'an do not exhaust all the blessings. The bliss of the Heaven is beyond human minds. Other features of the Heaven: in addition to positive features of the Heaven, the Qur'an has rejected any negative features about it. With respect to its positive features, the Qur'an says that the Heaven is eternal and permanent, secure, stable, continuous, and available. Negative features from which the Heaven is said to be free, include: suffering, frustration, sadness, committing sins , vain talks, attributing lies, hearing any lies, intoxication, and dementia. Degrees In the Islamic culture, it is accepted that the degrees of the Heaven are correlated with human actions, but it is not obvious what degrees are yielded by each action. According to exegetes of the Qur'an, such as al-Fakhr al-Razi , the word, \"darajāt\" (degrees), in the Qur'an with respect to the Heaven, refers to the ranking of the blessings in the Heaven: human beings will enjoy different degrees of the Heaven in accordance to their actions. The Qur'an and hadiths have emphasized different degrees of the Heaven. According to a hadith from the Prophet (s), the Heaven has degrees the distance between each of which is like the distance between the Earth and the sky. Actions and Characters of Heavenly People Many actions are said by the Qur'an and hadiths to lead people to the Heaven. Men and women are said to be equal in this respect. The most frequently mentioned features of heavenly people in the Qur'an include faith , piety , righteous action, obeying God and His messenger, accepting the truth, purity, and avoiding polytheism . The Qur'an also points to characters such as humbleness towards God and people, fear of God, good behavior, avoiding mundane desires, truthfulness, generosity , trustfulness, keeping one's promises, financial aid of the impoverished, avoiding vain talks and actions, and avoiding arrogance . Some people are said to be prohibited from entering the Heaven, such as those who deny divine signs or revelations of God. Some characters and actions that lead to the Heaven include: helping other people, being kind to people, good talk, and avoiding any injustice to others. Some wrong behaviors deprive people of going to the Heaven, such as telling lies, talebearing , ridiculing others, malevolence, contributing to the injustice of the rulers, promiscuity, and drinking wine. The Heaven of Adam (a) and Eve In three Qur'anic suras ( Qur'an 2 :35, Qur'an 7 :19-20, and Qur'an 20 :115, 117 and 120), the first residence of Adam (a) and Eve is said to be the \"Heaven\" (Jannat). According to Qur'anic verses, they enjoyed all the blessings in the Heaven and all of their desires were satisfied, but despite this abundance and welfare, they were warned not to approach a certain tree (and not to eat its fruit). They were also warned about the Devil 's temptations. Adam (a) and his wife disobeyed God, followed the Devil's temptations, and ate the fruit of the forbidden tree . They were thus deported from the Heaven and had to live on the Earth. After this fall (hubut), the life of the human species began on the Earth. There are three views, in Islamic exegetical and theological books, with respect to this Heaven. Al-Fakhr al-Razi has cited all the three views and the arguments for them. Here are the views: (i) it refers to a garden on the Earth, (ii) a heavenly garden other than the promised Heaven, and (iii) the promised Heaven. Al-Fakhr al-Razi holds that all the three views are plausible, though none of them can be proved. Thus, he remained neutral on the issue. Al-Allama al-Majlisi has also pointed to these three views and their arguments. He cited hadiths according to which the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve is the promised Heaven. In other sources, it is identified as a garden on the Earth. Al-Majlisi concluded that we cannot decide on this issue. He also speculated that it might be the heaven of Barzakh Among later exegetes of the Qur'an, Muhammad 'Abduh take the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve to be an Earthly one, taking this to be the view of Sunni scholars. However, Allama Tabataba'i takes the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve to be in the sky, but other than the promised Heaven. He takes it to be located in the world of Barzakh. He also takes the Qur'anic story of the fall from Eden to be a metaphor for the birth of every human person in this world. Books and Writings regarding the Heaven Many independent works have been written about the Heaven and the Hell . Moreover, significant parts of many collections of hadiths are devoted to the citation of hadiths concerning the Heaven and the Hell. Here are some Shiite works in this regard: Ma'alim al-zulfa written by Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani . The section of \"al-'Adl wa l-ma'ad\" (justice and resurrection) in Bihar al-anwar by Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi . Sifat al-janna wa l-nar : a collection of hadiths from Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) regarding the Heaven and the Hell written by Su'ayd b. Janah al-Azdi , a companion of Imam al-Kazim (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) . The book is wholly cited in Ikhtisas and Bihar al-anwar . In addition to Shiite works, some Sunni works are also devoted to the citation of hadiths regarding the Heaven and the Hell, including: Sifat al-janna written by Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani . Shu'ab al-iman written by Ahmad b. Husayn al-Bayhaqi . Al-Targhib wa l-tarhib written by 'Abd al-'Azim b. 'Abd al-Qawiy al-Mundhiri .

{"title": "Hell", "text": "Hell or Jahannam (Arabic: جَهنَّم ) is a place in the afterlife in which evil-doers will be punished . The place or parts of it are referred to in the Qur'an also as \" Jaḥīm \" ( الجَحیم ), \"Saqar\" ( السقَر ), \"Sa'īr\" ( السعیر ), and in many cases, it is referred to as \"al-Nar\" ( النار , the Fire). The Hell is not only mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths ; it is also discussed in Islamic disciplines such as theology , philosophy , and theoretical mysticism . Lexicology The word, \"Jahannam\", literally means a very deep pit. It refers to a fire with which God will punish the sinners in the afterlife . In the terminology of the Qur'an, it refers to the location of afterlife punishments where evil-doers and unbelievers will be punished. Most Muslim lexicographers take \"Jahannam\" to have a non-Arabic root, while some of them take it to have an Arabic origin. Isma'il b. Hammad al-Jawhari and al-Raghib al-Isfahani take it to be a persian word. Al-Raghib takes the original form of \"Jahannam\" to be \"Jahannām\" ( جَهَنّام , a Persian word which means a deep pit). Ibn Athir, Ibn Manzur, and al-Suyuti speculate that the word has a Hebrew origin; they hold that it is derived from the Hebrew word, \"Kihinnām\". Contemporary western researchers take the word to be originated from the Hebrew word, \"Gehennom\" (גיהנום), or \"Jihinum\" which means the valley of Banu Hinum. Hell in Eschatology In eschatology, the Hell is taken to be the worst place as opposed to the Heaven which is taken to be the best place. The Heaven is home to all the good, and the Hell is home to all the sufferings. Agents of the Hell All agents of the Hell are angels and servants who absolutely obey God . In the Islamic doctrine, there is no Hell the control of which is in the hands of devils. The Hell is totally ruled and controlled by God. According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Hell is a torture for the sinners and is a mercy for its agents who work inside it. The main guard of the Hell who is called \"Malik\" ( مالك ) is characterized in hadiths as being very ugly and stinky. The 19 guards of the Hell to which the Qur'an refers are characterized as being so frightening that if an earthly person looked at them, he or she would die immediately. The Philosophy of the Hell The main question concerning the Hell is why evil-doers should endure such a hard and long punishment which is not comparable to hardships of this world with respect to its strength and eternity. Guarantee for religious ruling The fear of the Hell is taken by religious doctrines to be a performance bond for religious rulings. The Qur'an has asked people to fear the Hell and protect themselves and their family from its fire. Punishment for actions Several Qur'anic verses consider the Hell to be a \"punishment\" for one's evil actions. In addition to frequent terms that imply punishment, the term, \"nakal\" ( نَکال , reprisal) is also used, and God has been even characterized as being \"muntaqim\" ( مُنتَقِم , avenger). Embodiment of actions According to the doctrine of the Embodiment of Actions , the punishment endured by evil-doers is, in fact, the real form of their own actions, and it is the actions themselves which take the forms of punishments and bring sufferings to them. No suffering is imposed on anyone from the outside; rather the punishment is the result of their own actions. The notion of the Embodiment of Actions is implied by some Qur'anic verses; however, it is most obviously stated in Sura al-Zilzal (99):8: \"And anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it\" . In another verse of the Qur'an, usurping the possessions of an orphan is identified with eating the fire. From Death to the Resurrection After his death, the sinner endures sufferings in Barzakh (a world between this world and afterlife) until the resurrection . Then a divine court of justice is held on Dooms Day; those who deserve the Heaven will not suffer from the Hell, and evil-doers will be punished after being tried. However, some Islamic texts talk about immediate transfer to the Hell after death; it is as if the fire of the Hell lurks beyond the death. Such a picture is given about the people of the prophets Noah (a) and Lot (a) ; they were immediately moved to the Hell after they died by a divine punishment in this world. The Hell is said not to wait for evil-doers to go to it; rather it lurks in ambush for them. When evil-doers are about to enter the Hell, its fire flames. And when the divine court of justice is held after the resurrection, the Hell is brought to the scene. On Dooms Day, the Hell is presented to the evil-doers. They will see the Hell and know that they will be thrown into it, feeling the suffering before entering it. The sufferings of the Hell are referred to in the Qur'an as \"'Adhab yawm 'azim\" (the punishment of a tremendous day), \"'Adhab yawm 'aqim\" (the punishment of an inauspicious day), and \"'Adhab yawm kabir\" (the punishment of a great day) as attributed to the day of resurrection. The Hell acts like a hunter: some of its flames go out to capture certain groups of sinners and devour them. The flame is characterized as having two eyes and a fluently talking tongue. Such flames are commissioned to hunt three groups of sinners: obstinate tyrants, those who bothered God and His prophet, and those who make idols. Sometimes the picture is given with more details: there are flames that capture the murderers of Imam al-Husayn (a) , just like a bird that picks seeds from the ground, and take them inside the fire. The Hell is greedy to devour the sinners, and however many evil-doers are thrown inside it, it asks more by saying \"are there any more?\". The Hell lurks in ambush for every person. There is no person present at the day of the resurrection who does not enter it. However, one can find his or her way out of it provided that they have attained salvation. Some hadiths have elaborated this doctrine by talking about a hazardous bridge that goes through the Hell; those who have attained salvation will successfully cross the bridge, and the sinners will fall from it into the Hell. The bridge is characterized as being as narrow as the edge of a sword. Inspired by some Qur'anic verses, the bridge is sometimes called the Sirat . Groups of People Who Enter the Hell In some general statements in religious texts, it is said that many people from human beings and jinn will be punished in the Hell, but in other texts, the instances of people who are punished in the hell are specified with more detail. Polytheism and unbelief : the prime instance of people who are punished in the Hell are polytheists, [40] because polytheism is the biggest sin. [41] Those who take a creature as their god will burn in the fire of the Hell together with what they worshiped. [42] Some rare hadiths have even talked about the sun and the moon being thrown into the Hell, because they were worshiped by some people. [43] Sometimes it is said that unbelievers will be thrown into the Hell, and sometimes obstinate unbelievers are said to enter the Hell. [44] The notion of obstinacy is sometimes cashed out in terms of falsifying the signs of God [45] and ridiculing the divine signs. [46] Arrogance : arrogance is a sin with which many people of the Hell are characterized. [47] In some hadiths, the aspects of such arrogance are delineated. [48] For example, there is a hadith according to which most people in the Hell are arrogant people and tyrants. [49] Brutal rulers: it frequently appears in many hadiths that the first people who enter the Hell are brutal rulers. The theme appears in different Shiite [50] and Sunni [51] sources of hadiths. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) according to which a brutal leader is in the bottom of the Hell and will be punished in the most severe way. [52] Assistants of brutal rulers: people who lean towards brutal rulers [53] and guide them through their brutal acts [54] will be thrown in the Hell along with their bosses. [55] Other descriptions of the people of the Hell refer to the above notion: \"taghi\" ( , disobedient), \"mutrif\" ( , indulged in luxury), and \"musrif\" ( , extravagant). Sinners : one feature of the people of the Hell is that they are sinners and evil-doers, that is, they disobey God and His prophet. [59] The most important sin because of which people go to the Hell is the violation of the rights of people , such as killers of innocent people, [60] faultfinding people, gossipers, [61] and stingy collectors of wealth. [62] In hadiths, other groups of sinners are mentioned over and above the ones mentioned in the Qur'an. [63] The lusts and appetites lead one to the neglect of the horrors of the Hell. [64] Companionship with Sinners: According to some hadiths, people who have committed similar sins will be one another's companions in the Hell. That is, in addition to individual punishments, there is collective punishment as well. The Qur'an frequently talks about nations [65] or groups [66] entering the fire or about people being gathered to the Hell. [67] Although such groups are companions, the Qur'an has mentioned that they talk to each other in a hostile way and express their hate to one another. [68] Dwelling Forever In the initial picture given of the Hell, its dwellers can never go out of it and will be punished there forever. What reinforces this initial picture is that there is no death in the afterlife; dwellers of the Hell will never die, although all conditions that lead to death in this world are present. They do not die, and they never go out of fire. There is a hadith according to which the death is brought to the scene on Dooms Day in the form of a goat—in a way that everyone will recognize it as death—and it is slaughtered, so that people are disappointed from getting rid of their sufferings by death. There are many Qur'anic verses concerning the eternal punishment in the Hell for evil-doers. The Hell is sometimes referred to as \"Dar al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , House of Eternity) and \"'Adhab al-Khuld\" ( عذاب الخلد , Eternal Punishment). According to some People of the Book , those who enter the Hell will only be punished there for a few days and they will then be saved from the fire. However, their belief is strongly reproached in the Qur'an . However, there are few remarks in the Qur'an that led some Muslims to the belief that there are temporary punishments in the Hell as well. Sura al-An'am (6):128 talks about some people dwelling in the Hell forever, but it then qualifies it with the phrase: \"except what God wills\". Thus, some exegetes of the Qur'an maintained that some dwellers of the Hell might find a way out of it one day. There is also a Qur'anic verse according to which sinners \"will dwell therein for ages (ahqab, أحقاب)\" (78:23). This verse has also led some exegetes to believe that the Hell will be a temporary place, at least, for some of its dwellers. According to a hadith , \"I swear to God no one will be saved from the Fire unless they stay there for \"ahqab\" ( أحقاب , ages), each \"haqb\" ( حقب , age) being over 80 years. And if the dwellers of the Hell are told that they would stay there for as many years as all the sands in the world, they would still be delighted\". Dwellers of the Hell who will be saved from the fire after enduring some suffering for their evil actions are considered by some hadiths to be Muslim sinners. According to some hadiths, whoever has a little bit of belief or faith in their heart will be saved from the fire one day. And sometimes people are saved from the Hell by the intercession of some saints of God, while they have turned into ashes in the Hell. Features of the Hell Types of Punishment mentioned in the Qur'an Fire: the most important punishment with which the Hell is known is a burning fire. Some verses of the Qur'an talk about evil-doers falling into the fire, instead of falling into the Hell. However, the Qur'an highlights the peculiarity of this fire by characterizing it as \"burning fire\" or \"lidded fire\" that cooks the skin and leaves nothing. The fire is known as \"Nar Allah\" (the fire of God) and has flaming pillars, and unlike earthly fires, it starts from hearts and it flames outwards, rather than inwards. Its firewood are the human beings themselves. According to some Qur'anic verses, there is a fire that has human beings and stones as its firewood. Fire-related punishments: some punishments in the Hell are related to fire; for instance, \"samum\" ( سموم ) which is fierce blast of fire, and \"hamim\" ( حمیم ) which is boiling water which dwellers of the Hell have to drink, and it will be poured on their heads. Their clothes are also from fire or burning materials such as \"qatiran\" ( قطران , melted tar) and \"hamim\" . Food and drink: the Qur'an and hadiths have mentioned some of what the dwellers of the Hell will eat and drink. Unlike foods and drinks in the Heaven which are characterized with what is familiar to earthly ones, those in the Hell are characterized with unfamiliar terms, such as \"Zaqqum\" ( زقّوم ) which is a kind of tree, \"ghislin\" ( غسلین ) which is taken by the exegetes of the Qur'an to be filth, pus, and corruption from the washing of the wounds, \"dari'\" ( ضریع ) which is thorns or thorny fruit, and drinks such as \"ghassaq\" ( غساق ) which is paralyzing cold water, \"sadid\" ( صدید ) which is fetid or festering water, and \"shurb al-him\" ( شرب الهیم ), which is drinking like a thirsty camel. These terms have been difficult for the exegetes to explain. However, their general feature is that they do not quench thirst or feed up the person, they are stuck in one's throat, and tear up the viscera. Other punishments: there are other punishments in the Hell, such as chains and shackles , iron mace, whips, horrifying sounds in the Hell, tightness of the space, the feeling of pressure, and shadows which are fiercer than the fire. And many more punishments. Types of Punishment Mentioned in the Hadith There are more details in hadiths: for example, there is said to be prisons in the Hell with peculiar punishments, and they are called the prison of Bulas ( بولس ) or Falaq ( فلق ). There are descriptions of snakes and scorpions in the Hell which have been questionable for critics. Some snakes are introduced with their names. Of drinks in the Hell, \"tinat al-khiyal\" (essence of corruption) is mentioned, which is extracted from dwellers of the Hell themselves. There are hadiths about the feeling of disgust by eating and drinking in the Hell. Also, a mill is mentioned which grinds religious scholars who did not practice what they knew. \"Zamharir\", which is a Qur'anic word regarding the Heaven, has been used in hadiths in a different meaning, referring to a land in the Hell with a horrible, freezing cold which tears the bodies of the evil-doers into pieces. According to a hadith, people of the Hell take refuge to Zamharir in order to escape the fire, but they suffer even more in there, and so they beg God to return them to the fire. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, the Qur'anic verse according to which dwellers of the Hell will stay there forever \"except what God wills\" refers to them going to Zamharir for a while during their punishments. Gates and Floors of the Hell The Qur'an frequently points out that the Hell has gates. In one case, it says that the Hell has 7 gates each of which has an \"assigned portion\", that is, they are assigned to different classes of sinners. Some verses also refer to floors and stages of the Hell, for example \"the lowest stage (al-darak al-asfal) of the fire\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have taken \"al-darak al-asfal\" to refer to the lowest stage or floor of the Hell. Some lexicographers and exegetes point out that \"darakat\" with respect to the Hell are counterparts of \"darajat\" (degrees) with respect to the Heaven. However, the word, \"darajat\", has been used about the Hell as well. Some exegetes, such as ibn Jurayh, take the 7 gates to refer to the 7 stages (darakat) of the Hell. This is confirmed in a hadith as well. Some exegetes take the different names for the fires of the Hell to refer to these 7 stages or floors: \"Jahannam\", \"Laza\" ( لظی , flames of the fire), \"Hutama\" ( حطمة , that which crushes and breaks into pieces), \"Sa'ir\" ( سعیر , blazing fire), \"Saqar\" ( سقر , scorching fire), \"Jahim\" ( جحیم , hell fire), and \"Hawiya\" ( هاویة , bottomless pit). However, there is no agreement over their order. There are hadiths that characterize these stages individually; for example, \"Saqar\" is where arrogant people will dwell, and \"Sa'ir\" is where killers will be punished. Other Places of Hell In addition to \"darakat\" (or stages) of the Hell, there are some Qur'anic terms occurring in verses related to the Hell which are taken in some hadiths to refer to specific locations in the Hell. For example, the word, \"Sa'ud\" ( صعود , hard ascent or mount of calamities) in the Qur'an, Sura al-Muddaththir (74):17, is taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, the word, \"'Aqaba\" ( عقبة , height or ascent) is also taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, \"Hufra min al-nar\" (a pit of fire) as a pit in the Hell, \"Falaq\" as a pit in the Hell in which people are punished in different ways, \"Wayl\" as a horrifying valley or a pit in the Hell which it takes 40 years for one to reach its bottom, \"Ghayy\" ( غیّ ) as a valley in the Hell, \"Ghassaq\" ( غساق ) as a river or a valley full of scorpions, \"Atham\" ( اثام ) as a valley in the Hell, and \"Mawbiq\" ( موبق ) as a river of pus and blood in the Hell. There are other locations in the Hell mentioned in hadiths, such as the Pit of Sadness (Huzn, حزن ) from which the Hell itself escapes, the Pit of Habhab ( هبهب ) located in the valley of Saqar in which tyrants dwell, the Sakran ( سکران ) mountain and its valley, Ghadban ( غضبان ), in which there are coffins of fire, and a coffin of fire in the bottom of the Hell in which 6 people from the ancient time and 6 people from the Umma of Prophet Muhammad (s) are punished. Some Imami and Sunni scholars of hadiths have written independent books regarding the Hell and the Heaven, such as Sifat al-janna wa l-nar (Features of the Heaven and the Hell) by Sa'id b. Jinah which is the oldest book in this regard available to us. Humiliation and Deprivation According to Qur'anic doctrines, just as neglectful indulgence in mundane pleasures is punished by deprivation in the Hell, arrogance and tyranny in this world is punished by humiliation in there. From the very beginning, the way evil-doers are thrown into the fire is accompanied by humiliation, as implied by phrases such as \"falling into the fire\" , \"outcast into the fire\", \"being grabbed by the head or by the feet\" and the like. And when they are being punished, they are humiliated by different sufferings; for example, \"'Adhab al-hun\" ( عذاب الهون , humiliating punishment) is a punishment mentioned in the Qur'an for arrogance and tyranny. One manifestation of such humiliation is seen in evil-doers being reproached by the guards of the Hell as well as in a conversation between the dwellers of the Hell and the dwellers of the Heaven , as appearing in the Qur'an. The most significant deprivation of the dwellers of the Hell is that God never talks to them, which makes them forlorn in the Hell. There are Qur'anic verses in this regard according to which dwellers of the Hell ask the guards to pray for them to God, and when the guards disappoint them, they pray to God on their own. The Qur'an says that their requests, cries, wishes of ransoms for release, and wishes of another opportunity to return to this world and compensate their actions are not heard by God. It is repeatedly emphasized that dwellers of the Hell receive no help, have no new opportunity, and are not given any safety conduct . According to a sermon attributed to Imam Ali (a) regarding the features of the Hell: \"it is a house where no mercy can be found and no praying by its dwellers is heard\". There are some hadiths, however, to the effect that in some exceptional cases their praying is heard by God: for example, the one according to which there is a servant of God in the Hell who kept calling God as \"Ya Hannan, Ya Mannan\" (O the Charitable, O the Benefactor) for a thousand years. Finally, God sends Jabra'il to him to answer his calls and forgives him. In Islamic Theology The issue of rewards and punishments in the afterlife, and in particular, the issue of the Hell, constitute a large portion of theological works. There are some common theological issues regarding the Hell or Heaven, as there are specific issues about either of the two. Whether the Hell and the Heaven exist now: one theological question is whether the Hell and Heaven are already created or not. The question seems to be posed by Hisham al-Futi for the first time; he asked the question because he thought there was no point for the Hell or the Heaven to exist before the resurrection . Some scholars of the Mu'tazila , Najjariyya , and scholars associated with the Mu'tazila, such as Zaydiyya and Khawarij took al-Futi's question seriously and maintained that the Hell and the Heaven might not already be created; it is, indeed, possible for them to exist or not exist now. Some people, such as Abu Hashim al-Juba'i agreed with al-Futi, and some of the Mu'tazila, such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i and Abu l-Hasan al-Basri as well as Imami and Ash'ari theologians maintained that the Hell and the Heaven already exist. Eternity and immortality: another common question about the Hell and the Heaven is that of their eternity and immortality. The question was posed by Juham b. Safwan on the ground that it is not possible for a contingent entity to be infinite. Jahiz allegedly believed that there is no eternal dwelling in the Hell and that the dwellers of the Hell will eventually turn into fire. However, proponents of the eternity of the Hell and the Heaven tried to reply to objections by appeal to philosophical and theological reasoning as well as rhetorical arguments . Wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell: along with the theological issue of infallibility in the Heaven and the voluntary or involuntary abstinence from wrong-doing in there, there is a theological issue about wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell. One important theory in this respect is the theory of ilja', according to which God forces the dwellers of the Hell to quit wrong-doings, and so their abstinence is not praiseworthy. However, others believe that their abstinence from wrong-doings is because of their lack of motivations for such actions. They believe that only wrong-doing without any obstinacy towards God is possible in the afterlife. Committers of major sins in the Hell: this is a ramification of the old question about people who commit major sins. Khawarij take committers of major sins to be unbelievers if they do not repent to God, and so for them, there is no significant difference between the position of an unbeliever and a committer of a major sin who did not repent to God. Of Khawarij, Najda b. 'Amir who was more modest believed that it is possible for such evil-doers to suffer a punishment in accordance with their sins outside the Hell and then enter the Heaven. In his view, the Hell is only home to unbelievers and so a Muslim evil-doer does not enter the Hell. His view was later revised by some of the Murji'a. Muqatil b. Sulayman believed that Muslim committers of major sins suffer the Hell from a distance on the Sirat bridge and will suffer in accordance with their sins, and will then go to the Heaven without entering the Hell. The view of the Mu'tazila about the punishment of Muslim wrong-doers is grounded in their position concerning Manzila bayn al-Manzilatayn (a position between the two positions). Most of the Mu'tazila believed that in the afterlife, all people are only divided into two groups: people of the Heaven and people of the Hell, and so for them, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell just like the unbelievers, except that their punishment will be milder than that of the unbelievers. According to Imami and Ash'ari theologians, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell if they are not forgiven by God and will be punished in accordance with their sins and will then go to the Heaven until no monotheist remains in the Hell. They take \"khulud\" in the Qur'an to mean a long, rather than an eternal, stay in the Hell. Some of the Mu'tazila have the same view, adding that it does not fit the divine justice for monotheist wrong-doers to stay in the Hell forever. Some Imami theologians deny that such wrong-doers will go to the Heaven, although they do believe that they will finally go out of the Hell. He identified such an intermediate position between the Hell and the Heaven with what is called \" A'raf \" or \" Barzakh \" in the Qur'an. The goodness of the Hell: one theological question about the Hell is whether eternal punishment in the Hell is good. The question is taken seriously by later Mu'tazili theologians. In the school of Basra , scholars such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i believed that punishment in the Hell is neither good, nor bad, and it is a matter of convention to call it good or bad. But in the school of Baghdad , people such as Abu Ja'far al-Iskafi believed that punishment in the Hell is good and is a divine mercy even for unbelievers who suffer them. In Islamic Sufism and Mysticism Muslim mystics, just like the people of sharia, take the Hell to be a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the Hell. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the sharia as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers. Early Sufis emphasized the fear of God, detachment from this world, thinking about death, and the punishment of sinners. They exhibited fear of the consequences of committing sins, and remorse and shame as well as buka' (crying) because of their sins. In this ascetic Sufism, fear is preferred to hope due to its stronger impact on one's will, ascetic life, and the awakening of the soul. Such themes became more interior in the views of Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya. She emphasized the fear of divine punishment and believed that such a fear should be a believer's guide. She replaced the fear of eternal punishment or hope of eternal reward by the eternal love of God and His servitude. In fact, a Sufi's ideal is love of, and unification with, God. Thus, sins make one separated from God and the Hell is, indeed, the separation from God, which is the biggest deprivation. They even believe that if the blessings of the Heaven are to prevent one from seeing the divine beauty, a lover of God had better go to the Hell and see His beauty. In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God. The highest desideratum for them was divine love and satisfaction. Dhu l-Nun al-Misri believed that fear of the Hell was nothing compared to the fear of separation from God. Sufis emphasized that the fire of the Hell has nothing to do with real believers and lovers of God. In the remarks of Sufis, there are expressions such as the Hell of separation, the suffering of distance from the Beloved, the Hell of distance, and the humility of distance which are used in contrast to the suffering or fire of the Hell. They imply that the real suffering is that of distance from God, which is taken by Sufis to be a painful punishment. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are only psychological states of the soul after its separation from the body. A soul is prosperous or miserable to the degree to which they know God. The humiliating punishment of the soul can cease by the removal of the distance, that is, by the removal of one's ignorance of God.

{"title": "Indications of the Hour", "text": "Indications of the Hour or Ashrāṭ al-Sā'a (Arabic: أشْراط الساعَة ) is a term in the Qur'an and hadiths referring to a host of events that take place before the Qiyama . In some sources of hadiths, Indications of the Qiyama are mixed with the Indications of Reappearance and Indications of the End Time . Origin The word, \"ashrat\", is a plural form of \"shart\" which means a sign or an indication. \"Ashrat al-Sa'a\" refers to events that are signs of the occurrence of the imminence of the Resurrection. In the Qur'an The term, \"Ashrat al-Sa'a\", was used once in the Qur'an in the verse 18 of Sura Muhammad : \"Do they await anything except that the Hour should overtake them suddenly? Its portents have already come. When it overtakes them of what avail will the admonitions they were given?\" Some exegetes take the phrase, \"ja'a ashratuha\" (there have come its indications), to refer to the appearance of the Prophet (s) , saying that the Split of the Moon (Shaqq al-Qamar) and the revelation of the Qur'an were among the indications that happened in that period. In its characterizations of the Resurrection, the Qur'an points to relevant events and the signs of its occurrence as well, which usually accompany with the collapse of the order of this world. Characterizations of the Resurrection and the indications of its occurrence appear in Makki Suras , such as Sura al-Naba' , Sura al-Nazi'at , Sura al-Takwir , Sura al-Infitar , Sura al-Inshiqaq , Sura al-Fajr , Sura al-Qari'a , and some Madani Suras such as Sura Zilzal . Examples of \"Ashrat al-Sa'a\" (Indications of the Hour) as appearing in these Suras include the following: The split of the sky The scattering and collapse of stars The sun and the stars dying out The Earth shattering and expanding, throwing out whatever it has inside The Earth quaking in the strong way The Earth recounting what God has revealed to it The seas coming together and graves splitting Mountains moving and becoming like wool, fluffed up. People disappearing like moths. Why are the Indications of the Hour Reported in the Qur'an? According to some people, such indications are mentioned in the Qur'an in order to awaken the ignorant and encourage them to repent to God. Some scholars have appealed to a verse of the Qur'an to show that Indications of the Resurrection are recounted in response to frequent questions asked by Muslims in this regard. In Hadiths Some other Signs of the Resurrection are characterized in Shiite sources of hadiths, such as the sun rising from the west, lunar eclipses in the east, west, and the Arabian Peninsula, the uprising of Gog and Magog , the uprising of Dajjal , the uprising of the Beast of the Earth (Dabbat al-Ard), and a fire coming from Eden, leading people to the Resurrection. One of these signs is said to be the decent of Jesus (a) which is also cited in Sunni sources of hadiths. In some sources of hadiths, the Signs of Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are mixed with the Signs of the Resurrection. There is a hadith cited in Tafsir al-Qummi about \"Ashrat al-Sa'a\" according to which big corruptions in the world, such as the ignorance of prayer , following lustful desires, and the growth of bribery , usury , homosexuality , adultery , divorce , and the like, are mentioned as Signs of the Resurrection. However, the same events have also been introduced in other hadiths as Signs of the End Time or signs of the imminence of the Resurrection. Also, the bi'that (rise) of the Prophet (s) , the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , and the Blowing of the Trumpet have also been introduced as Signs of the Resurrection. Some people hold that the rise of the Prophet (s) is the first sign thereof. In Other Religions Indications of the Resurrection have been introduced in other religions as well. For example, according to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus was asked about the day and the hour of the end of the world, and he replied that he and angels are not aware of this, and it is only God who knows the exact day in which the world ends. In the two gospels, events and indications have been introduced as happening before the end of the world , including: The sun going dark The stars falling from the sky The spheres losing their bond Wars among nations The roar of the seas Starvations and chaos Brothers killing each other and fathers killing their children Children rioting against their parents Rise of Dajjal References The material for this article is mainly taken from اشراط الساعة in Farsi WikiShia. and Tribes and Groups Others Death Related Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related"}
{"title": "Punishment of the Grave", "text": "Punishment of the grave (Arabic: عذاب القبر ) consists of postmortem hardships and pressures suffered by humans in the world of barzakh (the intermediary world between this world and the afterlife). According to hadiths , punishments of the grave are occasioned by acts such as gossiping, carelessness about cleanliness and uncleanliness, a man's mistreatment of his wife, mistreatment of one's family, and taking the prayers lightly. On the other hand, punishments of the grave are removed by pilgrimage to Imam al-Husayn's shrine , being buried in Najaf , love of the Prophet’s household , dying between Thursday noon and Friday noon, and so on. Except Dirar b. 'Umar , a student of Wasil b. 'Ata' , all Muslims unanimously believe in the punishment of the grave. To prove such punishment, theologians have made recourse to the verse , \"They will say, ‘Our Lord! Twice did You make us die, and twice did You give us life.\" There is a dispute over whether one's the imaginal body suffers the punishment or one's this-worldly body does so, but the majority of theologians believe that punishment of the grave is suffered by one's body in barzakh. Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Bukhari , a Sunni scholar, cites a hadith from the Prophet (s) in his book, Sahih , to the effect that a deceased person would be punished when his or her relatives and friends cry for him or her. According to Yahya b. Sharaf al-Nawawi, a commentator on Sahih Muslim , the hadith has been interpreted away by Sunni scholars, since the punishment of the dead on account of the living's weeps would be at odds with verse 18 of Quran 35 according to which no bearer shall bear another's burden. Moreover, according to Ayisha , this hadith was not accurately transmitted from the Prophet (s). The Notion Punishment of the grave consists of hardships and pressures suffered by man after death. The world of grave is the same as the world of barzakh, which begins with the burial of the dead and lasts until the day of resurrection . In hadiths, instances of punishment of the grave are mentioned such as the heat of fire, pressure of the Earth, being bitten by insects, and enormous horror. According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) cited in Man la yahduruh al-faqih , punishment of the grave is not limited to those who are buried in the Earth. Indeed, it includes all those who die, even if they are not buried under the ground. Moreover, according to another hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) cited in Bihar al-anwar , most humans suffer the punishment of the grave. In some supplications transmitted from the Infallibles (a) , the suppliant takes refuge in God from the punishment of the grave. Based on certain hadiths, when the Prophet (s) buried his daughter Ruqayya , he prayed for the removal of her punishment in the grave. In her will to Imam ʿAli (a) , Fatima al-Zahra (a) asked him to recite the Qur'an and supplicate to God over her grave after her burial. In collections of hadiths, there are sections in which hadiths concerning the punishment of the grave are compiled. In the section on \"states of barzakh and the grave and its punishment and interrogation and other pertinent matters\" of his Bihar al-anwar , al-Allama al-Majlisi cited 128 hadiths in this regard. Occasions of Punishment of the Grave According to a hadith transmitted in 'Ilal al-shara'i' from Imam 'Ali (a) , punishment of the grave is occasioned by gossiping, urination, and a man's withdrawal from his wife. In a footnote in Bihar al-anwar , a man's withdrawal from his wife is interpreted as misconduct and mistreatment, and urination is interpreted as carelessness about cleanliness. In reference to these hadiths, Shaykh 'Abbas Qumi believes that much of the punishment of the grave arises from these three factors. Other things that might occasion such punishment include: Mistreatment of one's family: according to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , the reason for Sa'd b. Mu'adh 's punishment in the grave was his mistreatment of his family. [12] Taking the prayer lightly: according to a hadith cited in 'Ali Mishkini 's al-Mawa'iz al-'adadiyya , indolence in performing the prayers leads to the tightness and pressure of the grave. [13] Wasting God's blessings: [14] according to a hadith, a believer 's punishment in the grave is an expiation of the blessings he has wasted. [15] Moreover, based on hadiths, punishment of the grave is occasioned by gossiping, not being protected by the guardianship of the Infallible Imams (a) , failure to help the oppressed, and saying the prayers without wudu' (ritual washing). In the book Jami' al-sa'adat , if one's mother is not satisfied with him, his throes of death and punishment of the grave will be more intense. Alleviation of Punishment of the Grave In books of hadiths, factors are mentioned that contribute to the alleviation of, or emancipation from, punishment of the grave, including: Love of the Prophet's Household (a): according to a hadith from the Prophet (s) in Bihar al-anwar , love of the Prophet (s) and his Household is useful on seven occasions, one of which is in the grave. [21] Performing particular supererogatory prayers: according to hadiths cited by Sayyid b. Tawus in his Iqbal al-a'mal , performing particular supererogatory prayers in the months of Rajab and Sha'ban months removes punishment of the grave. [22] Being buried in Najaf: according to Hasan b. Muhammad al-Daylami in his Irshad al-qulub , there are hadiths to the effect that the soil of Najaf removes punishment of the grave and the interrogation by Nakir (the Denier) and Munkar (the Denied). [23] Recitation of the Quran: there are hadiths about virtues of Quranic suras to the effect that recitations of certain suras remove the punishment of the grave, including the persistent recitation of Quran 43 and Quran 4 on each Friday [24] and recitation of Quran 102 when sleeping. [25] Other cases that lead to the alleviation or removal of punishment of the grave include: Visiting Imam al-Husayn's shrine Performing the full ruku' in the prayer Performing the Night Prayer Fasting for four days of the Rajab month Dying between Thursday noon and Friday noon A woman's tolerance of her bad-tempered or poor husband A woman's renouncement of her right to the mahr (dower) in favor of her husband A child's good deeds after his or her parent's death. According to Imam Khomeini in his book, Sharh-i chihil hadith , the criterion for how long punishment of the grave would last is the extent of one's this-worldly attachment and one’s love of this world. Accordingly, the less the worldly attachment the wider the grave (or barzakh) and the shorter the stay therein. Does the Weep over the Dead cause Punishment of the Grave? In Sunni sources of hadith, a hadith is attributed to the Prophet (s) to the effect that a deceased person would be punished in the grave when his or her family and relatives cry for him or her. The hadith was transmitted by the Second Caliph and his son 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar . However, Aisha said that they did not accurately transmit the hadith from the Prophet (s), since what the Prophet (s) had actually said was: \"the deceased person is punished for his sins in the grave, while his close ones are crying for him at the time.\" According to al-Nawawi, a commentator on Sahih Muslim , Sunni scholars dispute over how this hadith should be interpreted. Some take it to pertain to those deceased persons who willed that people cry for them after their death, while others believe that punishment of the dead because of what the survivors do does not square well with the verse, \"No bearer shall bear another's burden.\" Punishment of the Barzakh body or Worldly body? There is a controversy over whether the punishment of the grave is suffered by the worldly body or by a barzakh body . According to the majority of theologians and philosophers, upon death, the human soul will attach an imaginal body (a body resembling the worldly body, except that it lacks its matter and its features such as weight and mass). Nevertheless, al-Sayyid al-Murtada and Sadid al-Din Himmasi al-Razi, two Imami theologians, allegedly hold that upon death the soul returns to the physical body, and the pressure of the grave is experienced by the worldly body. According to 'Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji , those who believe that the soul does not survive the physical death hold that punishment of the grave is solely experienced by the body, but those who believe that the soul survives the physical death maintain that upon death the soul returns to the body, and punishment of the grave is either experienced by the soul only or by the soul and the body both. According to Abu l-Hasan al-Ash'ari , the founder of Ash'arite School, there is a dispute among Muslims as to the punishment of the grave. In his view, the majority of Muslims believe in such punishment, while he attributes the denial of this punishment to Mu'tazilites and Khawarij . In his Tabaqat al-Mu'tazila , Ibn Abi l-Hadid quotes Qadi-l-Qudat as saying that since Dirar b. 'Umar , a student of Wasil b. 'Ata' , did not believe in the punishment of the grave, the view came to be attributed to all Mu'tazilis, while they generally endorse such punishment, with only a few of them having doubts about the punishment of the grave. However, the majority of Mu'tazilis who believe in the punishment of the grave attribute it to the soul rather than the physical body. Quranic Evidence According to what al-'Allama al-Majlisi has quoted from Shaykh al-Baha'i , the following verse has been adduced in books of theology as evidence for the punishment of the grave: \"They will say, ‘Our Lord! Twice did You make us die, and twice did You give us life.\" The argument runs as follows: the first death is in this world and the second death is in the grave, and the first case of giving life is in the grave and the second case is on the day of resurrection . According to al-Allama al-Majlisi, some Quranic exegetes such as 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar Baydawi and Fadl b. Hasan al-Tabrisi in his Jawami' al-jami' interpret the above verse as follows: the first death is before the formation of the sperm and the second is after its formation. The first account is also attributed to Fadl b. Hasan al-Tabrisi in his Majma' al-bayan and to Fakhr al-Razi. Al-Allama al-Majlisi has also interpreted the term \"wretched life\" in the Quranic verse \"But whoever disregards My remembrance, his shall be a wretched life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection\" as punishment of the grave. Moreover, in Majma' al-bayan (written in the sixth/twelfth century) some exegetes are quoted as saying that in the verse \"We will punish them twice, then they shall be consigned to a great punishment\" one of the two punishments is that of the grave and the other is that of the resurrection. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , a Shiite exegete of the Quran (d. 1981), the verse \"the Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. On the day when the Hour sets in, Pharaoh's clan will enter the severest punishment\" implies that Pharaoh's clan would be exposed to the fire first, and then they would enter the fire, where the former can be interpreted as punishment of the grave and the latter as punishment after the resurrection. Bibliography Punishment of the grave has been discussed in books such as Shaykh 'Abbas Qumi's Manazil al-akhira (Stations of the Afterlife), Muhammad Shuja'i's ' Uruj-i ruh (The ascent of the spirit), and Ni'mat Allah Salihi Hajiabadi's Insan az marg ta barzakh (Man from death to barzakh). Moreover, independent works have been devoted to the punishment of the grave, including: Tahqiqi Qur'ani wa riwaʾyi darbara-yi adhab-i qabr (A Quranic and hadith-based investigation of punishment of the grave) by Mahdi Farbudi, which was published in 2007-8. ʿĀlam-i qabr: raz-i buzurg (The world of the grave: the great mystery), by Jabir Ridwani.

{"title": "Qiyamat Sughra", "text": "Al-Qiyamah al-Ṣughra (the Lesser Resurrection) (Arabic: القیامة الصغری ) refers to the period between death and al-Qiyamah al-Kubra (the greater Resurrection). Referring to this hadith of the Prophet (s) saying, \"When a person dies, his resurrection will begin\" , some scholars of theology believe that every person has two resurrections: A lesser resurrection and a greater resurrection . The lesser resurrection of a person begins with his death and continues until the greater resurrection. Some theological books use the expression \"al-Qiayamah al-Sughra\" to refer to Barzakh . According to verses of the noble Qur'an , the time of the greater resurrection is unknown and only God knows about it. Fayd Kashani said that as soon as all humans die, the lesser resurrection will end and the greater resurrection will begin; but, the time when all people would die is known only by God. According to hadiths, the lesser resurrection is peculiar to humans, while in the greater resurrection, all beings will be present. In some hadiths and Shi'a books, Raj'a is referred to as the lesser resurrection. In the terminology of Islamic mysticism , the volitional death is referred to as the lesser resurrection.

{"title": "Burial Night", "text": "Burial Night or Laylat al-dafn (Arabic: لَیلَةُ الدَّفن ) is the first night after the burial of a deceased person in grave. In Islamic culture, this night, its characteristics and events have been extensively discussed. According to hadiths , the first night after burial is an important night for the person passed away and has different stages. Among its important events are meeting different angels , questioning the person and receiving his answers and the pressure of the grave . Some actions such as the prayer of burial night can help the deceased person to pass these events. The first night in the grave is beautiful and relaxing for believers and very harsh and dreadful for disbelievers and wrongdoers. Entering the Grave According to hadiths and religious teachings, since the time the person is in his deathbed and the first moments of death approaching, the person sees the result of his actions and will be pleased of or suffer from them. In the first hours and days after death, the soul , while being in the world of Barzakh , finds itself beside the physical body. Due to the great attachment it has had with the body in this world, it is attentive toward it and follows it in the movements and while it is being washed, and then sees itself with the body in the grave, when it is buried. As soon as the deceased person enters the grave, his first night begins and it is the roughest night he inevitably will experience. The states of the deceased person are greatly influenced by his actions, beliefs and his attachment to the material world. Muslim philosophers refer to a hadith of Imam al-Sadiq (a) and interpret \"the grave\" and all its events referring to \"the world of barzakh\". According to this view, entering the grave and the first night in grave begins from the first moments after death and is not related to the burial of the body. The Time of Burial It is recommended to place the body twice on the ground near the grave and wait for some minutes and do not hurry to bury the body, because entering the body to the grave brings about great fear to the soul; so, the delay helps the soul which is with the body to become familiar with the new environment and easily bears that fear. Presence of an Angel called Ruman After burying the body, the first angel visiting it is Malik Ruman. In the third supplication of al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya , Imam al-Sajjad (a) hails to this angel. The job of this angel is reckoning and summing up the actions of people and compiling them in a file for them which will be considered their action records. The person will carry this file, nature of which is unknown to us, until the Day of Judgment , when it will be opened to him and he will be judged accordingly. This angel, based on the person’s actions, advises the next angels to be either harsh or easy on the person. Questions of the Grave Questions of Nakir and Munkar are among the most important events of the first night in grave. They enter the grave after the angel Ruman. One of them stands at the right side of the person and the other at his left side and ask him questions. If the person is a disbeliever or a sinner, he meets those angels having scary faces and they will punish him. His grave will be then filled with fire and thus they will be called Nakir and Munkar. If the person is a believer , he will be able to answer questions with the help of the friends of God and the two angels will meet him with kind and beautiful faces and will give him the good news of entering the paradise and his grave will be expanded with blessings of God. That is when the two angels are called Bashir and Mubashshir. According to hadiths , in this night, the faith of the person will be questioned and that if he believes in God and His Prophet (a) and about whom he took as his leader and Imam in the world. In other hadiths, more questions are mentioned. According to some hadiths, questions and answers of the first night in grave are general and include all human beings. Some scholars have excluded two groups of people from being questioned: people such as Prophets (a) and Imams (a), and those who do not have the requirements for answering such as kids and mentally ill people. 'Allama Majlisi mentioned that there are no clear hadiths in this regard and believed that it is better not to give opinion about it. According to some other hadiths, questions and answers in the grave are for mere believers or disbelievers. Thus, in his Hayat ma ba'd al-mawt , 'Allama Tabataba'i did not consider questions and answers in the grave for common people. Factors for Easy Passage of the First Night in Grave It is recommended that relatives of the deceased person do not leave him after burial and through dictation , help him answer the questions of Nakir and Munkar. In addition to the actions, acts of charity , prayers and the fasting the deceased person has performed, some actions such as gifted prayers and prayer of burial night performed by his relatives are influential in relieving him from or decreasing difficulties of the grave for him. Those without Grave The first night in grave is not only for those who are buried, but also those whose bodies are not buried and destroyed due to burning or explosion, will experience the first night in grave, the questions and also the pressure of the grave . According to one view, all the mentioned issues happen to this material body and God can give the power to perceive and answer to scattered or burned body parts and gives water, air or anything in the world the power to make pressure on or punish the body or its parts; thus, if a body decays in the air, it will not be excluded from this rule. Al-Kulayni narrated that, \" Yunus b. 'Ammar asked Imam al-Sadiq (a) , If a person who was hung up would have punishment of grave as well? Imam (a) answered: \"Yes, God, the Almighty will order the air to surround him with pressure.\" According to philosophers, since the grave is interpreted as the world of barzakh , its night is especial to it and the first night in grave does not necessarily begin after the deceased person is buried. The Relation between the Material Grave, the Soul and the World of Barzakh There is an especial relation between the grave in barzakh and the grave in this world, i.e. there is a relation between the soul in barzakh and the material body in the grave. It comes originally from the relation between the soul and the material body which have a kind of unity during the life in this world. With death, this relation does not completely break, but a weak relation between the soul in barzakh and the material body remains. Thus, the material grave is related with the grave in barzakh and the soul which is present in a supernatural world is attentive toward the material body and the place where it is buried. It is because of this relation between the material grave and the grave in barzakh that there are certain rulings about the material grave, funeral , shrouding , burial , respecting graves, recommendation of visiting graves, making supplication and asking for forgiveness upon graves and as such in Islam . This relation between the soul in barzakh and the material body in the material grave will remain in the next hours and days after death due to the great attachment the soul has had with the material body in this world. This attention and relation gradually decreases after the soul finds attachment with the body in barzakh and the ideal form and only a weak relation remains between the soul and the material body thereafter. Pressure of the Grave One of the certain events which will happen in the grave is the pressure of the grave referred to in hadiths as \"Daghtat al-qabr\" ( ضغطة القبر ). Companions of Imams (a) have frequently asked them about it and also asked if it included everyone. Abu Basir asked Imam al-Sadiq (a): If a person would be relieved of the pressure of the grave? Imam (a) answered: \"The refuge of God is to be sought for the pressure of the grave, for how few people would be relieved of the pressure of the grave.\" The Prayer of Burial Night In hadiths, it is recommended ( Mustahab ) that people perform the prayer of burial night for the deceased person at the first night after his burial. It is known among people as Salāt al-Wahsha and is recommended to be performed in either way below: To perform a two-rak'a prayer, on the first rak'a of which, after reciting sura al-Fatiha , Ayat al-Kursi should be recited once and in the second rak'a, after reciting sura al-Fatiha, sura al-Qadr should be recited ten times and after saying salam (last phrase of prayer), the following phrase should be recited: \" «أللهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلی مُحمّدٍ و ‌آلِ مُحمّدٍ وَ ابعَث ثَوابَها إلی قبرِ فلان \", but instead of \" فلان \", the name of the deceased person should be mentioned. To perform a two-rak'a prayer, on the first rak'a of which, after reciting sura al-Fatiha, sura al-Tawhid should be recited twice and on the second rak'a, after reciting sura al-Fatiha, sura al-Takathur should be recited and after the prayer, the following phrase should be recited: \" «أللهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلی مُحمّدٍ و ‌آلِ مُحمّدٍ وَ ابعَث ثَوابَها إلی قبرِ فلان \", but instead of \" فلان \", the name of the deceased person should be mentioned. This prayer is recommended (Mustahab) to be performed after burial, even if there are some days of delay between the death and the burial. It is to be performed since the beginning of the night until fajr , but it is better to be performed at the beginning of the night after 'Isha prayer . The Meaning of Day and Night in Barzakh About the world of barzakh, it should be said that even though it is not completely known to us, but it can be learned from some verses and hadiths that time exists in barzakh. But what is the meaning of day and night in barzakh is a truth the details of which cannot be perceived by us easily, because time as known to us with sunrise and sunset which make day and night does not exist in barzakh, unless it is said that since the teachings of revelation are for the people in this world, then morning and night have been used in references and the statement such as \"their punishment in the mornings and nights in barzakh\" is used, so that it can be comparable to this world; however, there is no actual sunrise or sunset there. Therefore, the same way it is said that there is no matter in the world of barzakh while there are forms, sizes and volumes the same as the material world; the same is said about time and place; and, the first \"night\" in grave is a relative address.

{"title": "Hanut", "text": "Ḥanūṭ (Arabic: حَنوط ) refers to wiping camphor on seven parts of the dead body of a Muslim which touch the ground in prostration . It is obligatory and mixing it with the Soil of Imam al-Husayn's (a) grave is recommended . Meaning and Usage In jurisprudential terminology, \"hanut\" refers to camphor wiped over seven parts of the dead body (or the shroud of a dead person), by which the dead body is scented. Wiping camphor on the dead body is called \"tahnit\". Rules of Hanut Wiping camphor on the dead body of a Muslim is obligatory; but, wiping it on the dead body of a person who is wearing ihram clothes is not permissible because using fragrance is not permissible for a person wearing ihram. However, wiping camphor on the dead body of a woman during her idda of death and also wiping camphor on the dead body of a person who has been mu'takif is obligatory while using perfume has been forbidden for them (when they were alive) and they do not join in the rule of those who wear ihram clothes. There are disagreements on whether wiping camphor on the dead body should be performed before shrouding it, after it, or after putting the loincloth and before putting on the shirt or whether it is permissible to be performed in any of the mentioned cases. However, it is better if it is performed before shrouding. Method of Hanut There is a disagreement about the method of hanut. Some jurists consider wiping camphor on different parts of the dead body obligatory and some others have considered only touching camphor with the body sufficient and have considered wiping it as recommended . Parts of the Body for Hanut The obligatory parts of the body in hanut are the seven parts of the body which touch the ground in prostration as following, The forehead, the palms of both hands, two knees, tips of the toes and according to some views, the tip of nose. Some consider performing hanut for the tip of the nose as recommended; and some have considered it recommended to be performed as well on the armpit, jugular notch, under the knee, joints, the soles, back of the hands, and every part of the body which sweats and emits bad smell. It is recommended to wipe the extra camphor remained on the chest of the dead body. Inserting camphor in the eyes, ears and the nose of the dead body are makruh (reprehensible). Amount of Hanut The common view is that the obligatory amount of hanut is as much as it is called so. However, some jurists have said that it should be at least the size of one dirham and less than that is not sufficient. According to the mentioned common view, it is recommended that it should not be less than one dirham or according to another report, it should not be less than one mithqal , and it is better if it is about four dirhams or according to another report, four mithqals, and it is even better if it amounts to thirteen dirhams and one third of a dirham. If camphor is not available, the dead body will be buried without hanut. However, scenting the dead body is permissible using dharira, but it is not considered hanut. There is a disagreement on whether scenting the dead body with anything other than camphor or dharira is reprehensible or forbidden . Mixing camphor with dharira for hanut is permissible. If there is little camphor which is not sufficient to be used for both the ghusl of the dead body and hanut, it should be used for ghusl and between performing hanut on the forehead and other parts, the forehead is prior. Manners Mixing camphor with the soil from the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) is recommended, but it should not be wiped over the parts which would be considered as disrespect. Also, according to some sources' clear statement, it is recommended that performing hanut begins from the forehead. The appearance of some sources' statements implies its obligation .

According to hadiths , two angels called Munkar and Nakir or Bashir and Mubashshir interrogate a recently dead person at the first night of their death about their beliefs. So, these are called questions in the grave. Most scholars of hadith and theology believe that it is the same material body that one had in their life in this world to which the questions are addressed, but many philosophers believe that another body— Barzakhi body —is the body to which the questions are addressed. Questioners The first night when a corpse is placed in its grave, two angels—commissioned by God to interrogate the beliefs of the recently dead person—enter the person's grave. According to some hadiths, they are called \"the two guardians of the grave\". One of the two angels stands at the right side of the dead and the other at his or her left side, and they start interrogating the dead person by asking questions about his or her beliefs. If the person is an unbeliever or a sinner , then the two angels appear to him or her with a frightening face, and when the true character of the dead is revealed, he or she will be tortured by the frightening angels, called Munkar and Nakir Template:Note , and the grave will be filled with fire. But if the departed is a faithful and pious , then he or she can answer the questions with the help of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) . The angels will appear to him or her with a beautiful face, and are called \"Bashir\" and \"Mubashshir\" . They give him or her the good news of going to the Heaven and expand the grave with divine bounties. The Content of The Questions The questions asked by Munkar and Nakir (or Bashir and Mubashshir) are the most important events of the first night in the grave. According to frequently narrated ( mutawatir ) hadiths, the two angels ask the following: Who is your Lord? Who is your prophet? Which imam (leader) did you follow in the world? [3] According to other hadiths, further questions are also asked: What god do you worship? What prophet did you believe in? What was your religion ? What Sacred Book or Scripture was your guideline in life? Which imam (leader) did you follow? How did you spend your life? [4] How did you acquire money and how did you spend it? [5] Who were your friends in this-worldly life? [6] What was your qibla and did you say your prayers ? About hajj , fasting and zakat . [7] The Propeht (s): Know that the first thing that the two angels will ask you is about the Lord that you worshiped and the prophet that was sent to you and the religion that you believed and the scripture that you read and the imam (or leader) that you obeyed. They then ask you about the way you spent your life, how you gained money and how you spent it. Be cautious and think about yourself, and before the interrogation, prepare yourself for the answer. If you are a pious believer and a follower of prophets, then God will suggest the required answers to you and will open your tongue to the right thing, and you will successfully answer. At this time, God will give you the good news of the Heaven and a lot of good, and divine angels will welcome you with fragrance. Otherwise, you will stammer and you will lose your argument and fail to answer. You will be warned to go to the Hell and angels of torture will receive you. Al-Kulayni, , vol. 8, p. 72 The Addressees According to some hadiths, every person will be asked questions in the grave. Some scholars excluded two groups from post-mortem interrogation: people who are too virtuous and perfect to be asked such questions, such as prophets and Imams (a) , and people who had no religious obligations , such as children and mad people. Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi believes that since there is no explicit hadith in this regard, we had better remain silent about this. According to some hadiths, only pure believers and pure unbelievers are interrogated in their graves, and the rest of the people will be interrogated on Dooms Day . To reconcile these two groups of hadiths, some scholars hold that certain questions (such as a detailed interrogation of one's actions) are specific to pure believers and pure unbelievers, and the rest of the people are only asked about their basic religious beliefs in general. Talqin of the Dead Relatives and friends of the dead are recommended not to leave him or her alone after the burial , and help him or her answer the questions of Munkar and Nakir by talqin (dictation/instruction). If a person does good actions, gives alms , performs prayers and fast during his life in this world, then difficulties of the grave will be relaxed for him or her. Moreover, if their relatives do some actions on their behalf, such as gift prayers and burial-night prayers , that will also help the dead in the grave. Material Body or Barzakhi Body There is a disagreement about whether questions in the grave are addressed to the same material body that is put inside the grave or a barzakhi body that is connected to the material body and the grave. Most scholars of hadith and kalam (theology) appeal to the apparent meanings of Quranic verses and hadiths to show that the material body is asked the questions. In his al-Kafi , al-Kulayni cites a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) according to which: when the dead person is put inside the grave, the soul will return to his or her body and then two angels come and ask them questions. Most philosophers believe that one's barzakhi body is addressed by the questions. In response to the above hadiths, they interpret them allegorically. People Without Graves A person whose body is not buried or has disappeared by being burned or by an explosion will also undergo the first night of the grave, questions in the grave and the pressure of the grave . According to the view that all these happen to the material body, God can give the scattered or burned parts the power to undergo such experiences, as He can give the water or the air the power to exert pressure on these parts or the body. So even if a body is destroyed in the space, it will still undergo all these experiences. Al-Kulayni cited a hadith quoted by Yunus b. 'Ammar from Imam al-Sadiq (a) about a person who was hanged: will he undergo the sufferings of the grave? The Imam (a) replied: \"yes, God will order the air to exert pressure on it.\" And according to the view of philosophers, since the grave is interpreted as the world of barzakh, the corpse does not need to be buried in order for the above experiences to occur.

{"title": "Metamorphosis", "text": "Metamorphosis or Maskh (Arabic: مَسْخ ) is a kind of divine punishment in which one is transformed into an animal. In metamorphosis, the human identity is not lost, while its appearance changes into an animal figure. Some cases of metamorphosis are mentioned in Islamic sources, the best-known of which is the story of People of Sabbath . According to Qur'anic verses , People of Sabbath were people from the Children of Israel who defied God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays, and then, were transformed into monkeys. According to Islamic hadiths , metamorphosis occurs on the day of resurrection as well, when some sinners are transformed into animals such as monkeys and pigs. Some Quranic exegetes interpret the story as allegorical; that is, sins lead to animal temperaments. Such an interpretation is rejected by the majority of exegetes, however. They believe that appearances of the people in the story really changed. Definition of Metamorphosis and its Difference from Metempsychosis Metamorphosis is the transformation of something's appearances into something unpleasant. Metempsychosis is the attachment of the soul to another body after its separation from its own body. In metamorphosis, the soul is not separated from the body. Instead, the appearances of the body change and is transformed into an animal. Preservation of the Human Identity in Metamorphosis According to Muslim scholars, the transformation of human appearances does not amount to the change of his human nature. Thus, metamorphosis is not tantamount to the destruction of a human individual and creation of a monkey individual or the transmigration of a human soul into a monkey body. Instead, metamorphosis is the coincidence of two specific forms. That is to say, while the human specific form is still there, it has received a monkey specific form as well. Hence, the individual should be called a human monkey. Here is how Murteza Mutahhari explains the issue: \"in whatever way I am on the day of resurrection, whether I am with this body or with another body, I am one hundred percent the same person, although my appearances might have changed. Even if I undergo a metamorphosis on the day of resurrection in proportion to my psychological attitudes, and I am resurrected in an animal form, it is still me who has animal organs.\" Occurrence of Metamorphosis According to the Qur'an The Qur'an talks about the metamorphosis of some human beings. For example, the verse twenty of Qur'an 5 is about the transformation of some human beings into monkeys and pigs. Moreover, the verse sixty five of Qur'an 2 is about some people from among the Children of Israel , known as People of Sabbath , who were transformed into monkeys because they disobeyed God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays. Metamorphosis of some Disciples According to some Quranic verses, the disciples of Jesus asked God to send them a table of foods from the sky. When God sent them the table, He said: \"should any of you disbelieve after this, I will indeed punish him with a punishment such as I do not punish anyone in all creation.\" Some exegetes interpret the verse as follows: some disciples betrayed Jesus (a) despite the heavenly table, and then they were transformed into animals by God. Some other exegetes like 'Allama Tabataba'i have rejected this interpretation, taking it to be in conflict with other Quranic verses. How the Quranic Metamorphosis Occurred There are different accounts of how metamorphosis occurs in this world. The majority of Quranic exegetes believe that metamorphosis or maskh in the Qur'an is the transformation of the human body into another animal. Some others believe, nevertheless, that metamorphosis merely occurs in one's inner self, and human face or appearance does not change. Mujahid b. Jubayr (d. 102/720-1) says: \"the metamorphosis mentioned in the Qur'an is an analogy just like ‘the example of an ass carrying books’.\" 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashani said: the metamorphosis occurred merely in people's inner selves. In other words, the Jews who underwent metamorphosis were just like other people in their outer forms, although they were not humans in their inner selves. The same view is held by Rashid Rida and Muhammad Abduh . Notwithstanding this, the majority of Quranic exegetes believe that the metamorphosis in the Qur'an is used literally. That is, it really occurred in people's bodies and their appearances did change. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , there are mutawatir hadiths to the same effect. As to the objection that this kind of metamorphosis is improbable, advocates of the latter view argue that if we accept miracles by prophets , then the extraordinary character of an action cannot be evidence for its impossibility. Instead, this is a condition of miracles. Metamorphosis of Human Beings in Resurrection According to some hadiths, some people will be resurrected in animal forms. For example, Ma'adh b. Jabal asked the Prophet (s) about the Quranic verse, \"the day the Trumpet will be blown , and you will come in groups.\" The Prophet (s) said: some of them will be resurrected in the form of monkeys, some in the form of pigs, and so on.” According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) : \"those who deny the divine destination will be resurrected from their graves in the form of monkeys and pigs.\" Metamorphosis of the Soul Some Muslim scholars believe that human beings might undergo metamorphosis in their souls and thus they might spiritually turn into animals. Some Quranic exegetes maintain that the Quranic verse, \"they are just like cattle; indeed, they are more astray,\" is a reference to this fact. According to Murteza Mutahhari , a man's humanity depends on his moral characteristics, and if he gains the characteristics of a savage animal, then he has indeed undergone metamorphosis.\" Other Examples of Metamorphosis In some Shiite and Sunni sources, there are reports of metamorphosis of people other than those mentioned in the Qur'an. For example, there is a hadith cited in al-Khisal by al-Shaykh al-Saduq according to which thirteen animal species, including scorpions, bats, and bears, were original human beings who then underwent metamorphosis. Moreover, al-Tabarani, a Sunni scholar in third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, quoted the Prophet (s) as saying that some Muslims will undergo metamorphosis and turn into monkeys and pigs. The Fate of Metamorphosed People According to hadiths, people whose metamorphosis story is mentioned in the Qur'an survived just for three days, and they had no progenies. Sadr al-Muti'allihin says: \"Muslims have consensus over the fact that today's animals are not progenies of metamorphosed human beings, since these people died after three days without producing children during their animal period.\" See Also People of the Sabbath Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related"}
{"title": "Punishment of the Grave", "text": "Punishment of the grave (Arabic: عذاب القبر ) consists of postmortem hardships and pressures suffered by humans in the world of barzakh (the intermediary world between this world and the afterlife). According to hadiths , punishments of the grave are occasioned by acts such as gossiping, carelessness about cleanliness and uncleanliness, a man's mistreatment of his wife, mistreatment of one's family, and taking the prayers lightly. On the other hand, punishments of the grave are removed by pilgrimage to Imam al-Husayn's shrine , being buried in Najaf , love of the Prophet’s household , dying between Thursday noon and Friday noon, and so on. Except Dirar b. 'Umar , a student of Wasil b. 'Ata' , all Muslims unanimously believe in the punishment of the grave. To prove such punishment, theologians have made recourse to the verse , \"They will say, ‘Our Lord! Twice did You make us die, and twice did You give us life.\" There is a dispute over whether one's the imaginal body suffers the punishment or one's this-worldly body does so, but the majority of theologians believe that punishment of the grave is suffered by one's body in barzakh. Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Bukhari , a Sunni scholar, cites a hadith from the Prophet (s) in his book, Sahih , to the effect that a deceased person would be punished when his or her relatives and friends cry for him or her. According to Yahya b. Sharaf al-Nawawi, a commentator on Sahih Muslim , the hadith has been interpreted away by Sunni scholars, since the punishment of the dead on account of the living's weeps would be at odds with verse 18 of Quran 35 according to which no bearer shall bear another's burden. Moreover, according to Ayisha , this hadith was not accurately transmitted from the Prophet (s). The Notion Punishment of the grave consists of hardships and pressures suffered by man after death. The world of grave is the same as the world of barzakh, which begins with the burial of the dead and lasts until the day of resurrection . In hadiths, instances of punishment of the grave are mentioned such as the heat of fire, pressure of the Earth, being bitten by insects, and enormous horror. According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) cited in Man la yahduruh al-faqih , punishment of the grave is not limited to those who are buried in the Earth. Indeed, it includes all those who die, even if they are not buried under the ground. Moreover, according to another hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) cited in Bihar al-anwar , most humans suffer the punishment of the grave. In some supplications transmitted from the Infallibles (a) , the suppliant takes refuge in God from the punishment of the grave. Based on certain hadiths, when the Prophet (s) buried his daughter Ruqayya , he prayed for the removal of her punishment in the grave. In her will to Imam ʿAli (a) , Fatima al-Zahra (a) asked him to recite the Qur'an and supplicate to God over her grave after her burial. In collections of hadiths, there are sections in which hadiths concerning the punishment of the grave are compiled. In the section on \"states of barzakh and the grave and its punishment and interrogation and other pertinent matters\" of his Bihar al-anwar , al-Allama al-Majlisi cited 128 hadiths in this regard. Occasions of Punishment of the Grave According to a hadith transmitted in 'Ilal al-shara'i' from Imam 'Ali (a) , punishment of the grave is occasioned by gossiping, urination, and a man's withdrawal from his wife. In a footnote in Bihar al-anwar , a man's withdrawal from his wife is interpreted as misconduct and mistreatment, and urination is interpreted as carelessness about cleanliness. In reference to these hadiths, Shaykh 'Abbas Qumi believes that much of the punishment of the grave arises from these three factors. Other things that might occasion such punishment include: Mistreatment of one's family: according to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , the reason for Sa'd b. Mu'adh 's punishment in the grave was his mistreatment of his family. [12] Taking the prayer lightly: according to a hadith cited in 'Ali Mishkini 's al-Mawa'iz al-'adadiyya , indolence in performing the prayers leads to the tightness and pressure of the grave. [13] Wasting God's blessings: [14] according to a hadith, a believer 's punishment in the grave is an expiation of the blessings he has wasted. [15] Moreover, based on hadiths, punishment of the grave is occasioned by gossiping, not being protected by the guardianship of the Infallible Imams (a) , failure to help the oppressed, and saying the prayers without wudu' (ritual washing). In the book Jami' al-sa'adat , if one's mother is not satisfied with him, his throes of death and punishment of the grave will be more intense. Alleviation of Punishment of the Grave In books of hadiths, factors are mentioned that contribute to the alleviation of, or emancipation from, punishment of the grave, including: Love of the Prophet's Household (a): according to a hadith from the Prophet (s) in Bihar al-anwar , love of the Prophet (s) and his Household is useful on seven occasions, one of which is in the grave. [21] Performing particular supererogatory prayers: according to hadiths cited by Sayyid b. Tawus in his Iqbal al-a'mal , performing particular supererogatory prayers in the months of Rajab and Sha'ban months removes punishment of the grave. [22] Being buried in Najaf: according to Hasan b. Muhammad al-Daylami in his Irshad al-qulub , there are hadiths to the effect that the soil of Najaf removes punishment of the grave and the interrogation by Nakir (the Denier) and Munkar (the Denied). [23] Recitation of the Quran: there are hadiths about virtues of Quranic suras to the effect that recitations of certain suras remove the punishment of the grave, including the persistent recitation of Quran 43 and Quran 4 on each Friday [24] and recitation of Quran 102 when sleeping. [25] Other cases that lead to the alleviation or removal of punishment of the grave include: Visiting Imam al-Husayn's shrine Performing the full ruku' in the prayer Performing the Night Prayer Fasting for four days of the Rajab month Dying between Thursday noon and Friday noon A woman's tolerance of her bad-tempered or poor husband A woman's renouncement of her right to the mahr (dower) in favor of her husband A child's good deeds after his or her parent's death. According to Imam Khomeini in his book, Sharh-i chihil hadith , the criterion for how long punishment of the grave would last is the extent of one's this-worldly attachment and one’s love of this world. Accordingly, the less the worldly attachment the wider the grave (or barzakh) and the shorter the stay therein. Does the Weep over the Dead cause Punishment of the Grave? In Sunni sources of hadith, a hadith is attributed to the Prophet (s) to the effect that a deceased person would be punished in the grave when his or her family and relatives cry for him or her. The hadith was transmitted by the Second Caliph and his son 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar . However, Aisha said that they did not accurately transmit the hadith from the Prophet (s), since what the Prophet (s) had actually said was: \"the deceased person is punished for his sins in the grave, while his close ones are crying for him at the time.\" According to al-Nawawi, a commentator on Sahih Muslim , Sunni scholars dispute over how this hadith should be interpreted. Some take it to pertain to those deceased persons who willed that people cry for them after their death, while others believe that punishment of the dead because of what the survivors do does not square well with the verse, \"No bearer shall bear another's burden.\" Punishment of the Barzakh body or Worldly body? There is a controversy over whether the punishment of the grave is suffered by the worldly body or by a barzakh body . According to the majority of theologians and philosophers, upon death, the human soul will attach an imaginal body (a body resembling the worldly body, except that it lacks its matter and its features such as weight and mass). Nevertheless, al-Sayyid al-Murtada and Sadid al-Din Himmasi al-Razi, two Imami theologians, allegedly hold that upon death the soul returns to the physical body, and the pressure of the grave is experienced by the worldly body. According to 'Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji , those who believe that the soul does not survive the physical death hold that punishment of the grave is solely experienced by the body, but those who believe that the soul survives the physical death maintain that upon death the soul returns to the body, and punishment of the grave is either experienced by the soul only or by the soul and the body both. According to Abu l-Hasan al-Ash'ari , the founder of Ash'arite School, there is a dispute among Muslims as to the punishment of the grave. In his view, the majority of Muslims believe in such punishment, while he attributes the denial of this punishment to Mu'tazilites and Khawarij . In his Tabaqat al-Mu'tazila , Ibn Abi l-Hadid quotes Qadi-l-Qudat as saying that since Dirar b. 'Umar , a student of Wasil b. 'Ata' , did not believe in the punishment of the grave, the view came to be attributed to all Mu'tazilis, while they generally endorse such punishment, with only a few of them having doubts about the punishment of the grave. However, the majority of Mu'tazilis who believe in the punishment of the grave attribute it to the soul rather than the physical body. Quranic Evidence According to what al-'Allama al-Majlisi has quoted from Shaykh al-Baha'i , the following verse has been adduced in books of theology as evidence for the punishment of the grave: \"They will say, ‘Our Lord! Twice did You make us die, and twice did You give us life.\" The argument runs as follows: the first death is in this world and the second death is in the grave, and the first case of giving life is in the grave and the second case is on the day of resurrection . According to al-Allama al-Majlisi, some Quranic exegetes such as 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar Baydawi and Fadl b. Hasan al-Tabrisi in his Jawami' al-jami' interpret the above verse as follows: the first death is before the formation of the sperm and the second is after its formation. The first account is also attributed to Fadl b. Hasan al-Tabrisi in his Majma' al-bayan and to Fakhr al-Razi. Al-Allama al-Majlisi has also interpreted the term \"wretched life\" in the Quranic verse \"But whoever disregards My remembrance, his shall be a wretched life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection\" as punishment of the grave. Moreover, in Majma' al-bayan (written in the sixth/twelfth century) some exegetes are quoted as saying that in the verse \"We will punish them twice, then they shall be consigned to a great punishment\" one of the two punishments is that of the grave and the other is that of the resurrection. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , a Shiite exegete of the Quran (d. 1981), the verse \"the Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. On the day when the Hour sets in, Pharaoh's clan will enter the severest punishment\" implies that Pharaoh's clan would be exposed to the fire first, and then they would enter the fire, where the former can be interpreted as punishment of the grave and the latter as punishment after the resurrection. Bibliography Punishment of the grave has been discussed in books such as Shaykh 'Abbas Qumi's Manazil al-akhira (Stations of the Afterlife), Muhammad Shuja'i's ' Uruj-i ruh (The ascent of the spirit), and Ni'mat Allah Salihi Hajiabadi's Insan az marg ta barzakh (Man from death to barzakh). Moreover, independent works have been devoted to the punishment of the grave, including: Tahqiqi Qur'ani wa riwaʾyi darbara-yi adhab-i qabr (A Quranic and hadith-based investigation of punishment of the grave) by Mahdi Farbudi, which was published in 2007-8. ʿĀlam-i qabr: raz-i buzurg (The world of the grave: the great mystery), by Jabir Ridwani.

{"title": "Resort to the Dead", "text": "Resort to the Dead or Tawassul to the dead (Arabic: التوسل بالأموات ), is to seek intermediary through prominent religious leaders after their death so that they ask God to respond to one's requests. Muslims , and in particular Shi'as , believe in the resort to the dead, which is based on the presumption that the dead are able to hear the living people ( Sama' al-Mawta ) and have a life in barzakh . Shiite and Sunni sources refer to cases in which Ahl al-Bayt (a) and some of the companions resorted to the Prophet (s) after his death. Wahhabis and Ibn Taymiyya reject the legitimacy of the resort to the dead. The Notion Tawassul to the dead is the resort to the prominent religious leaders, such as the Infallibles (a) , after their death so that they ask God to respond to one's requests. Posthumous Hearing and Life in Barzakh The resort to the dead is acceptable only if there is life in barzakh and the dead are able to hear the living people, that is, only if it is possible for living persons to communicate with souls in the world of barzakh and it is possible for the souls in barzakh to hear them. Legitimacy For the legitimacy of the resort to the dead, it has been appealed to Qur'anic verses , the practice of Ahl al-Bayt (a), and the practice of Muslims: Qur'anic Evidence For the legitimacy of the resort to the dead, it has been appealed to the unqualified tone of the Qur'an 4 :64 in which believers are encouraged to ask the Prophet (s) to pray for their forgiveness by God. The verse generalizes both to the period of the Prophet's (s) life and the period after his death. Moreover, the Qur'an 5 :35 permits the resort in an unqualified way, which implies that one can make a resort to the souls of believers and prophets (a) after their death as well. The Practice of Imams of the Shi'a According to some sources, Imams of the Shi'a resorted to the Prophet (s) after his death. Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) have resorted to the Prophet (s). In his al-Tawassul Supplication , Imam al-Sajjad (a) resorted to both dead and living Infallibles. Moreover, supplications transmitted from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , such as the Supplication of Sari' al-Ijaba , show that the resort to the religious leaders is recommended even after their death. The Practice of the Companions There are reports in Sunni sources of hadiths to the effect that some of the companions and Muslims resorted to the Prophet (s) after his death. For example: A'isha 's resort to the Prophet (s) so that the drought comes to an end. The resort of a man during the caliphate of Uthman as instructed by Uthman b. Hunayf . [2] Bilal b. al-Harith 's resort to the Prophet (s) to pray for precipitation. According to one report, Malik b. Anas had a conversation with Mansur al-Dawaniqi in which he taught him how to visit the Prophet's (s) mausoleum and resort to him. The Sunni View The majority of Sunni scholars permitted the resort to the dead and did themselves resort to religious leaders. Al-Samhudi, a Shafi'i scholar in the tenth/ sixteenth century , wrote a book, Wafa' al-wafa' bi akhbar dar al-Mustafa , in which he collected cases where people resorted to the Prophet (s) and their requests were met. According to Abu Ali Khilal, whenever he had a problem, he visited the grave of Imam al-Kazim (a) and resorted to him and his problem was solved. Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i was quoted as saying that the Household of the Prophet (s) are means for the proximity to God . The Wahhabi View Wahhabis dismiss the resort to the dead as illegitimate and impermissible. Ibn Taymiyya (whose views are frequently cited by Wahhabis) believes that the resort to the prayers of the Prophet (s) and righteous people is legitimate only when they are alive, and it is an instance of polytheism to resort to them after their death. Reply According to proponents of the resort to the dead, there is no difference in resorting to divine people during their life and after their death. Just as one can legitimately ask the Prophet (s) and other divine people to pray for one and ask God for one's forgiveness during their lives, one can do so after their death as well. The Qur'an 4 :64 has also been appealed to, which includes both the period of the Prophet's (s) life and the period after his death. Moreover, the practice of Muslims, including the companions, shows that the resort to the dead was permissible.

{"title": "Burial", "text": "Burial or Dafn (Arabic: الدفن ) is the interring of a corpse. The burial is performed in accordance with certain shari'a rulings and manners after shrouding and saying funeral prayer . Burial is a collective duty ( collective obligation ), that is, it is waived if someone else undertakes it. In Jurisprudence In sources of jurisprudence , a part of \"kitab al-tahara\" (the book of cleanliness) or \"kitab al-salat\" (the book of prayer) is devoted to the rulings of corpses. These books are concerned with the rulings of a sick person who observes signs of death in him or herself (e.g. such a person should repent and make up for God's rights and people's rights ), the rulings of ihtidar , that is the time when one is about to die (e.g. being directed to the qibla and instruction of Islamic beliefs), and actions that others are obliged to do after a Muslim dies (e.g. ghusl of the corpse , shrouding , tahnit , saying funeral prayer and burial). In each of these stages, which show the respect for the deceased and bring about the forgiveness of his or her sins, there are non-obligatory rulings ( recommended and makruh (reprehensible) elaborated in works of jurisprudence. In early works of jurisprudence and hadith , the rulings of the deceased are introduced under \" Kitab al-jana'iz \" (the book of the corpses) or \" Bab fi ahkam al-jana'iz \" (a section concerning the rulings of the corpses). The obligations regarding the deceased have a collective nature (al-wujub al-kifa'i), that is they are waived if someone else undertakes them, and some of them (such as shrouding, tahnit, and burial) do not require the intention of the proximity to God , and others (such as ghusl and the funeral prayer) require such an intention. If for certain reasons, it is not feasible to perform any of these obligations, then the person will be excused. Preparations Ghusl: According to Imamiyya jurists , the ghusl should be performed three times: first with water mixed with cedar , then with water mixed with camphor , and then with pure water. Tahnit: after that, tahnit should be performed, that is, camphor should be rubbed on seven parts of the body that touch the earth in sajda (forehead, two palms, two kneels, and the tips of the big toes). Shrouding: it is an obligation to shroud the corpse of a Muslim with three pieces of cloth covering the whole corpse. Funeral : according to hadiths and sources of Imamiyya and Sunni jurisprudence, there is a great deal of virtue for the funeral of a dead person, that is carrying and/or going after the corpse. Funeral prayer : after these stages, a funeral prayer should be said for the corpse of a Muslim over 6 years old. Rulings and Philosophy The burial includes the digging of a pit in the ground in which the corpse is placed and then covered with soil. The obligation of burying a corpse is emphasized in verses of the Qur'an , the tradition of the Infallibles (a) , the practice of Muslims, and the consensus of jurists. According to hadiths, the corpse should be buried because it is a respect for it, it hides it from people, it protects the corpse from any offenses by his or her enemies, it reduces the remorse of his or her friends, and prevents the spread of the malodor of the corpse. These underlying reasons require that the grave be deep enough. It is obligatory to place the corpse on its right side in the direction of qibla . Sunni jurists also hold it obligatory to place the corpse in the direction of qibla. The traditions and manners of burial (recommended and makruh rulings) are elaborated in sources of jurisprudence, including prayer of burial night , holding a blessing ceremony for the deceased, sympathizing with the mourners, and visiting the grave . If it is not feasible to dig the earth, then the corpse should be covered in other ways, such as by constructing a building on it or placing it in a coffin. According to Imamiyya and Sunni jurists, it is makruh (or reprehensible) to bury a corpse with a coffin except when there is an exigency. If one dies in the sea or on a ship and his or her corpse decays before taking it to the land, then it should be thrown into the sea after ghusl, shrouding and saying the funeral prayer. Crying for the Deceased Person It is permissible to cry for the deceased provided that it does not imply the denial of the divine verdict, but actions such as hurting one's face, scratching one's skin and pulling one's hair, are forbidden, and mourners are recommended to remain patient. Moving the Corpse to Another City Scholars of Hanafi , Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of jurisprudence take it illegitimate to move the corpse of a Muslim from the place where it died to another city, after it was buried (except under certain circumstances), but most of them take it legitimate to do so before the burial. However, scholars of Maliki school of jurisprudence take it legitimate to move the corpse, both before and after the burial, provided that the corpse is respected and there is an exigency for doing so. Shi'i jurists take it recommended to move the corpse to sacred places before its burial, but there is a disagreement among them to move it after the burial, although most of them take it permissible or even recommended. Thus it is permissible to exhume the corpse from the grave in order to move it to sacred places, and it was a common practice among Shi'a. If the corpse is supposed to be moved to another city, then it is obligatory to observe all the conditions of burial throughout the move, and the corpse is recommended to be placed in a coffin in order to prevent any disrespect to it. Exhumation Shi'i jurists unanimously maintain that it is forbidden to exhume (nabsh) a corpse from the grave, that is, uncovering a corpse that is already buried. Therefore, the uncovering of a grave where the corpse has definitely turned into soil or when the corpse is placed inside a coffin is not an instance of exhumation (nabsh). In some cases, it is not forbidden to exhume a corpse, including when the place in which the corpse is buried is trespassed (ghasbi), that is owned by someone who did not give the permission to bury the corpse in it, when the corpse is buried without ghusl or shrouding at all or in the proper manner, when it is necessary to see the corpse in order to discover some essential truth, and when the corpse is buried in a disrespectful place, such as when it is buried in a non-Muslim graveyard or in a garbage place. It is not permissible to exhume children of Imams (a) , well-known righteous people, scholars, and martyrs even after a long time. Sunni scholars have also forbidden the exhumation except in certain cases. References Beliefs Rulings of the Dead Connection with the Dead Related Death Related"}
{"title": "Soul-taking", "text": "Soul-taking or Qabḍ al-rūḥ (Arabic: قَبْض الروح ) is to take away human lives at the time of death . This is carried out by Azrael ('Izra'il) and his representatives at the command of God . According to Islamic sources, people's souls are taken in different ways; for example, the souls of prophets (a) are taken after their own permissions, the souls of believers are taken by angels of mercy in an easy way, and the souls of unbelievers are taken with tortures and punishments . Some hadiths have recommended the recitation of the Qur'an 36 and the Qur'an 37 as well as moving the muhtadar (the person who is about to die) to the place in which he or she used to say prayers in order for his or her soul to be taken easily. The Notion Taking the soul is to separate one's soul from the body. It is referred to in the Qur'an as \"tawaffi\" (taking or grasping). When it is time for someone to die, Azrael and his representatives will take the person's soul at the command of God . According to religious sources, a human soul is taken gradually. When the soul is leaving the body, the person's legs and hands weaken at first, and the last part of the body that stops working is the throat. According to a hadith from Imam 'Ali (a) , at the time of death, the tongue will fail to talk. Then the death begins to spread to the rest of the body; the ears will stop working, so the person will not be able to talk and will not hear anything. The eyes will move around. The person sees the faces of the surrounding people and the movements of their lips, but he or she does not hear their voices. After a while, the death spreads to the eyes and then the life will go out of the body. How the Soul is Taken According to hadiths , the soul is taken gradually and painfully. Believers also feel the fears and hardships of death, though people's souls are taken in different ways. The death of prophets (a) and believers take place in an easier way than that of unbelievers. Prophets According to Shiite hadiths, the souls of prophets are taken very easily upon their permissions. There are stories in this regard. For example, at the time of the Prophet Muhammad 's (s) death, Azrael went to his house and asked for the permission to enter the house and take his soul. In this event, Azrael had a conversation with Fatima (a) . About the prophet Abraham (a) , it is said that Azrael went to him to take his soul. Abraham told him: \"does God like his friend (that is, Abraham) to die?\" Azrael went and then returned with God's message: \"is Abraham sad that he would meet his friend?\" As soon as Abraham heard this, he died. According to some hadiths, Azrael took Solomon 's soul while he relied on his cane in his palace. There are also stories about Moses (a) and Noah (a) being asked for permission by Azrael before their death. Believers According to Sura al-Nahl , the souls of believers are taken by the angels of mercy with ease, and they are given the news of going to the heaven . According to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , when a believer is about to die, shining angels with heavenly outfits sit around him or her, and then the Angel of Death (Azrael) tells him or her, \"O the pure soul! Come out to your Lord\". Then his or her soul is taken just like water coming out of the waterskin. According to some hadiths, when believers are about to die, they become impatient, but then the Prophet (s) and Ahl al-Bayt (a) go to them whereby they find peace and comfort. Unbelievers According to Islamic sources, the soul of an unbeliever is taken with suffering and excruciating pains. According to Quranic verses , the souls of unbelievers are taken with hardship and torture, while they are surrounded and beaten by angels of death from back and forth. There is a hadith from the Prophet (s) to the effect that when an unbeliever is about to dies, black-faced angels sit around him or her with anger, and then the Angel of Death goes to him or her, separating his or her soul from the body just like a comb separating trashes from the wool. Soul-Takers There are many verses in the Qur'an concerning the taking of the soul. In some verses, the taking of the soul is attributed to God, in others to the Angel of Death , and in still others to a group of angels. According to Quranic exegetes, the verses are not contradictory because God is the ultimate cause and agent of soul-taking but the act is immediately accomplished by Azrael or other angels who are Azrael's representatives. According to some sources, Azrael has many representatives and helpers, thus death is sometimes attributed to a group of angels. These angels are referred to as \"Nazi'at\", \"Sabihat\", \"Nashitat\" and \"Sabiqat\" each of whom undertakes the task of taking the souls of a certain group of beings. For example, \"Nazi'at\" are assigned the task of taking the souls of unbelievers with hardship and torture, and \"Nashitat\" are assigned the task of taking the souls of believers with mercy and comfort. A few scholars maintain that when a person is about to die, the same angels who were in charge of recording his or her actions will take his or her soul. Mitigating the Taking of the Soul Some hadiths have recommended that for a believer to make his or her soul be taken easily, he or she should be moved to the place where he or she used to say prayers . Other hadiths have recommended the recitation of Sura Saffat and Sura Yasin . Notes References Beliefs Rulings of the Dead Connection with the Dead Related Death Related"}
{"title": "Funeral Prayer", "text": "              This section is a general introduction to the rulings of a fiqhi topic.  The Funeral prayer (Arabic: صلاة الجنازة ) is an obligatory prayer that should be said on the corpse of a Muslim. It consists of five takbirs (that is, \"Allah Akbar\") after each of which, except the last one, particular supplications should be recited. The prayer should be said while standing. The Funeral prayer has no ruku' , sujud , or salam; it is not required to have wudu , ghusl , or tayammum in order for this prayer to be valid, although it is recommended to observe the conditions of other obligatory prayers in it. The prayer can be said in congregation, although people who perform the Funeral prayer behind a leader should recite takbirs and supplications by themselves. Rulls The Funeral prayer is a collective duty (al-wajib al-kifa'i), that is, if some people say it, then it is not obligatory for others to say. When a Muslim passes away, other Muslims are obliged to ritually wash his or her body, cover the corpse with a shroud , say prayers on it, and then bury it. If one Muslim does this, then others will not be obligated to do so. The Funeral prayer is so important that if a corpse is buried without a prayer or with an invalid prayer, the prayer should be said on the grave. It is obligatory to say the Funeral prayer for Muslims over six years old, and it is forbidden to be said on the corpse of non-Muslims. Conditions of the Funeral Prayer Performer Unlike other prayers, ritual purity (that is, wudu , ghusl , or tayammum ) or ritual cleanness of the worshiper's body or clothes or taking off one's shoes are not required, but other conditions of this prayer is like those of other prayers, and the supplications should be recited accurately. How to perform it? After the corpse is ritually washed and covered with a shroud, it should be put in the direction of qibla such that its head is placed on the right side of the worshipers. The worshipers should first intend the Funeral prayer and, while standing, they should recite takbir five times. After the first four takbirs, they should recite particular supplications, and with the 5th takbir, the prayer is finished. The prayer can be said in congregation, but people who say the prayer behind the leader should recite all the takbirs and supplications on their own. The first supplication is a testimony of God's unity and the prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad (s) . The second is salawat to Muhammad (s) and his progeny . The third is a request for divine forgiveness for all Muslims, and the fourth is a request for divine forgiveness for the deceased person. One can only recite the obligatory parts of the supplications, but it is recommended to recite the more detailed version thereof (below is one of the recommended supplications). In the fourth supplication, there is slight difference between a female and a male corpse with regard to Arabic pronouns. The supplications of the Funeral prayer Takbir Obligatory Supplication Mustahab Supplication اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لا الهَ الَّا اللَّهُ وَ اَنَّ مُحَمَّداً رَسوُلُ اللَّهِ اَللَّهُ اَکبَرُ اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لا اِلهَ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاشَریک لَهُ وَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَ رَسُولُهُ اَرْسَلَهُ بِالْحَقِّ بَشیراً وَ نَذیراً بَینَ یدَی السّاعَةِ اَللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلی مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ و بارِک عَلی مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَارْحَمْ مُحَمَّداً وَ آلَ مُحَمَّدٍ کاَفْضَلِ ما صَلَّیتَ وَ بارَکتَ وَ تَرَحَّمْتَ عَلی اِبْرهیمَ وَ آلِ اِبْرهیمَ اِنَّک حَمیدٌ مَجیدٌ وَ صَلِّ عَلی جَمیعِ الاَنْبِیآءِ وَالْمُرْسَلینَ Muhammad (s) his progeny Ibrahim (a) اَللَّهُمَّ اْغفِرْ لِلْمُؤْمِنینَ وَ الْمُؤْمِناتِ اَللّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِلْمُؤْمِنینَ وَالْمُؤْمِناتِ وَالْمُسْلِمینَ وَالْمُسْلِماتِ الاَحْیآءِ مِنْهُمْ وَالاَمْواتِ تابِعْ بَینَنا وَ بَینَهُمْ بِالْخَیراتِ اِنَّک مُجیبُ الدَّعَواتِ اِنَّک عَلی کلِّ شَیئٍ قَدیرٌ اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِهذَا المَیت اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِهذِهِ المَیتَةِ If the deceased is male: and If the deceased is female: O' Allah!

{"title": "Camphor", "text": "Kāfūr (camphor, Arabic: کافُور ) is a white crystalline substance with a strong aroma which is used in performing ghusl , embalmment and shrouding a dead body. The word \"kafur\" is mentioned in the Qur'an , but there are different views among exegetes about its meaning. It has an important position in Islamic hadiths , medicine, and traditional medicine and has been prescribed for some diseases. Meaning Camphor is a white aromatic and crystalline substance with a bitter smell and taste which is obtained by boiling crumbled pieces of the stalks and stems of a special tree and letting it evaporate. Camphor does not only exist in the camphor tree, but it is a volatile oil which can be found in many plants and some lexicologists defined it as the blossom or the husk of the palm tree or the nodes of a grape tree. Its nature is cold and dry. The word \"kafur\" is also mentioned in the Qur'an 76 :5, \"Indeed the pious will drink from a cup seasoned with kafur\". Shi'a exegetes have different views about the meaning of \"kafur\" here. Some considered it used in its lexical meaning referring to any cold and fragrant substance or anything with a good smell. Some other exegetes mentioned its extraordinary whiteness and coldness because it is a perfect example of that. Some others referred to its lexical root in \"k f r\" meaning \"to cover\" and said that because it is derived from the fruit which is covered in the husk, it has been called \"kafur\". Religious Use Camphor is used in preparation of a dead body for burial . Ghusl of the dead : based on the fatwa of most Shi'a authorities , ghusl is performed to a dead person three times; the second time of which, water mixed with camphor is used [8] and about its amount in water, it has been said that it should not be so much that the water becomes mudaf , nor should it be too little that its mixture with water is not obvious. [9] Hanut [embalmment] : according to the fatwa of Shi'a religious scholars, applying camphor on seven parts of the body used in prostration which are the forehead, palms, the two knees and the tips of the two big toes of feet is obligatory . [10] Shroud : It is quoted from Imam al-Sadiq (a) that upon shrouding a dead person, on every piece of the shroud , some camphor and cardamom should be poured. [11] In hadiths , perfuming the shroud of a dead body has only been permitted using camphor; [12] because a dead person is considered as a person who has worn ihram clothes. [13] Position in the Paradise In the interpretation of verse 5 of Qur'an 76 , some exegetes consider \"kafur\", the name of a spring in the paradise , or a spring mixed with the smell of camphor, because it is known as a fragrance beside other good smells such as musk and ginger and the righteous and servants of God drink from it, but it is different from the camphor in this world. In the interpretation of some topics mentioned in the Qur'an such as \"do not approach this tree\", it is transmitted from Imam al-Sadiq (a) that the tree in this verse refers to camphor tree. Also, in the interpretation of the verse 27 of Qur'an 83 , \"and whose seasoning is from Tasnim, * a spring where those brought near [to Allah] drink.\", the spring refers to camphor or a spring with the taste of camphor, from which the righteous and the People of the Right Hand drink. According to some hadiths, this spring flows from beneath a tree in the paradise the trunk of which is in the house of the Prophet (s) and its branches spread in all houses of the paradise. The Prophet (s) considered his creation in this world beside perfume and ambergris and also introduced camphor as one of the levels or degrees of the paradise. In another hadith from the Prophet (s), it has been considered the soil of a tree in the paradise called Tuba , or likening it to the shadow of that tree which is cool like camphor. It has also been described as the mortar for building a house in the paradise. Elsewhere, it has been mentioned as a fragrant smell in the houses of the paradise. In another hadith, in a description of the Kawthar Pond , from which believers benefit, its nature has been likened to camphor regarding coolness. After mentioning his position in the paradise, Imam 'Ali (a) mentioned that his clothes in the paradise are from camphor. In Islamic and Traditional Medicine and Its Benefits Besides being a good smell from the paradise, in Islamic hadiths, camphor has also been prescribed as an effective medicine for different diseases. This issue has been mentioned in Tibb al-A'imma (a) , Bihar al-anwar and other hadith books. For example, the book attributed to Imam al-Rida (a) and also a book in which hadiths from Imam al-Sadiq (a) in medicine are collected can be mentioned. Because of its benefits in medicine, camphor has been focused by most scholars and has been mentioned in different books of medicine since the past till now, where they mentioned its benefits and recommended it for different diseases. This substance is beneficial for some diseases including diseases of hot-natured people and is harmful to cold-natured people.

{"title": "Ghusl mass al-mayyit", "text": "This section is a general introduction to the rulings of a fiqhi topic. Ghusl mass al-mayyit (Arabic: غسل مسّ الميّت ) (ritual bathing after touching a dead body) is a ghusl that becomes obligatory on whoever touches dead body that is cold and is not given ghusl of the dead. Sunnis believe that it is not obligatory. Conditions of Compulsion and Rulings Sunnis believe that ghusl mass al-mayyit is not obligatory. On the contrary, Shi'a jurists maintain that it is obligatory; however, only al-Sayyid al-Murtada said that it is recommended . There are fifty hadiths about the rulings of ghusl mass al-mayyit just in Wasa'il al-Shi'a and Mustadrak al-wasa'il . One who touches a cold dead body must perform ghusl mass al-mayyit; however, if the dead body was given the three special ghusls of the dead (i.e. ghusl al-mayyit), ghusl mass al-mayyit is not obligatory. Touching an animal carcass will not cause compulsion of any ghusl. According to the fatwa of most Marja's , ghusl mass al-mayyit is also obligatory if one touches a part of body that was cut from a human body (dead or alive), provided that the part has bone. There is disagreement whether touching a dead body voids wudu or not. Most Marja's count touching a dead body as al-hadath al-asghar (an act that voids wudu); so one who has touched a dead body cannot do those acts that are subject to having wudu, such as performing prayer and touching the verses of the Qur'an . Some jurists have counted touching a dead body as al-hadath al-akbar (an act that voids ghusl, such as janaba and hayd ); so one who has touched a dead body cannot do the acts that are subject to having ghusl, such as: performing prayer, touching the verses of the Qur'an, staying in Masjid and so on. Touching a dead body for several times or touching several dead bodies does not cause several ghusls and only one ghusl mass al-mayyit will suffice. According to common opinion of jurists, ghusl mass al-mayyit does not suffice for performing prayer, and one should make wudu in addition to ghusl mass al-mayyit for performing prayer. Touching the Imams and Martyrs' bodies Ghusl mass al-mayyit is not waijb after touching the body of the infallible Imams (a) and martyrs . Some jurists have also excluded the one who has performed ghusl al-mayyit before being executed as hadd or qisas (retaliation). In these cases, touching the dead body of the deceased does not cause ghusl mass al-mayyit. How to Perform? Like other kinds of ghusl , ghusl mass al-mayyit is performed in two ways: Tartibi (Sequential) and Irtimasi (by Immersion). It only differs from other ghusls in intention . Wisdom In hadiths , hygiene and spiritual purification are mentioned as the wisdom of ghusl mass al-mayyit.

{"title": "Funeral Procession", "text": "Funeral procession (Arabic: التشییع , tashyīʿ) is a ceremony, usually in the form a procession, in which people carry the corpse of a deceased. It is one of the mustahab practices in Islam, for which a great divine reward is promised. Literal and Terminological Meanings The word tashyi' literally means to accompany someone to say goodbye and to attend a funeral. In the terminologies of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), it refers to accompanying a corpse until the time it is buried in the grave. Divine Rewards According to hadiths , there is a great divine reward for attending a funeral procession. The Prophet (s) said: \"if a person accompanies a corpse, each of his steps, from when he goes there until when he goes back home, will be rewarded like 100,000 good deeds, and 100,000 of his sins will be forgiven, and he will be given 100,000 degrees by God, and if he also says prayers on the corpse, 100,000 angels will accompany his corpse when he dies, while asking God to forgive him, and if he also attends the burial of the corpse, God will commission 100,000 angels to ask for his forgiveness until the Dooms Day.\" The Prophet (s) told Abu Dhar : \"O' Aba Dhar! Whenever you accompany a corpse, your mind should be preoccupied with it with humbleness, and beware that you will also join him or her\". Imam al-Sadiq (a) said: \"when you carry a corpse on your shoulders, imagine that it is you who is carried as though you ask your Lord to return you to this world to do some good deeds; how will you then restart your life?\" He then added: \"I wonder how people the resurrection of whose dead is postponed so that the survivors join them are nonetheless busy with their games and entertainments.\" Imam al-Sadiq (a) said: \"it is recommended that the mourners let Muslim brothers of their deceased loved one know about his death so that they attend his funeral and say prayers on him; this would yield divine rewards for them and divine forgiveness for the deceased person.\" The Prophet (s) said: \"the best person who attends a funeral is one who remembers (God and death and afterlife) and who does not sit until the corpse is placed inside the grave, and the best reward will be given to one who pours three handfuls of soil on the grave.\" Once Imam 'Ali (a) heard someone laughing in a funeral. He told him: \"It is as if only other people are destined to die and the rest have the right to live in this world, and it is as if when we see the dead, we see travelers who will return to us! We put them in their graves and inherit their property as though we will live after them forever. The fact is that we are subjects to any lethal catastrophes.\" Jurisprudential Rulings It is highly recommended to attend the funeral procession of a dead believer. According to some faqihs , it is recommended in cases when burying a corpse requires carrying it. One case in which it is permitted for a mu'takif to leave the mosque is when he or she leaves it to carry the corpse of a believer, without his or her i'tikaf to be invalidated. Degrees of Virtues Some faqihs mentioned three degrees of the virtues of accompanying a corpse: The lowest is to accompany it until when funeral prayer is said for it. The next degree is to accompany it to its grave and stay after the burial. And the most virtuous is to accompany it after the burial, asking for his or her forgiveness and asking God to help him or her to be steadfast on his or her beliefs when Munkar and Nakir (the interrogating angels) question him or her. Some faqihs cast doubt on the first degree to count as a proper case of accompanying a corpse. Recommended Practices Reciting the supplications recommended for the moments of observing and carrying a corpse Thinking about death and the afterlife Accompanying the corpse on foot Walking behind or on either side of the corpse Carrying the corpse with four people from the four sides with each person carrying it on his shoulder in a particular manner Carrying the corpse on one's shoulder, rather than carrying it on a vehicle, except when the way to the grave is too long The mourner should change his normal clothing, such as removing the robe from his shoulder or walking barefoot. Makruh Actions Riding a vehicle Laughing Being entertained or busy with pointless activities Carrying the corpse quickly Carrying a fire behind the corpse, except when it occurs at night Removing the robe from one's shoulder, except for the mourner Talking except about God, and sitting before the corpse is buried in the grave Attendance of women, especially young women. Some scholars hold that it is not makruh (reprehensible) for an old woman to attend the funeral. References Beliefs Rulings of the Dead Connection with the Dead Related Death Related"}
{"title": "Ghusl of the Dead", "text": "Ghusl of the dead (Arabic: غسل المیت ) is a specific sort of washing a Muslim's corpse with certain conditions. It is one of the obligatory ghusls in Islamic rulings—it is collective obligation (al-wajib al-kifa'i) that can be waived if someone undertakes it. In this ghusl, the deceased is bathed three times: first with water mixed with cedar , then with water mixed with camphor , and finally with pure water. Significance When a Muslim dies, others have a collective obligation to wash his or her body in a specific way, and bury the corpse after covering it with a shroud and performing the Funeral Prayer on it. There are 278 hadiths in the books, Wasa'il al-shi'a and Mustadrak al-wasa'il , regarding the jurisprudential rulings of the ghusl of the dead. Great divine rewards are mentioned in hadiths for a person who washes the corpse of a Muslim, such as one's being saved from the hellfire in the afterlife , taking one to the Heaven , and the forgiveness of one's minor sins in one year. Ghusl of the Dead of Infallible Imams (a) According to many hadiths, the corpse of an Infallible Imam (a) is only washed by the next Imam (a). And when Imam al-Mahdi (a) passes away, Imam al-Husayn (a) will return to this world (see: raj'a ) and take care of washing his corpse. Ghusl of a Martyr A Muslim who is martyred in the battlefield does not need to be washed, nor covered with a shroud. He should be buried with the very clothes on his body. Some scholars consider the ghusl of a martyr to be forbidden. Ghusl of Children If a child's (as well as a mad person's) father or mother is Muslim, his or her corpse should be washed like other Muslims. A fetus that is aborted or miscarried before it is 4 months does not need to be washed; it should be covered with a cloth and buried. However, if it is 4 months or older, it should be washed. Ghusl After Qisas If someone is legitimately sentenced to death, then they can perform the ghusl of the dead for themselves before the execution. In this case, their corpse does not need to be washed again after their death. Impurity of the Corpse Before the Ghusl Before the ghusl, the corpse of a Muslim is najis , and everything that touches it becomes impure. And when the corpse is cold, then if one touches it, he or she has to perform the ghusl of touching a corpse. However, after the ghusl, the corpse is tahir. Procedures According to fatwas of the majority of Shiite Marja's , it is obligatory to wash a corpse three times: first with water mixed with cedar, then with water mixed with camphor, and finally with pure water. It is obligatory to do these three ghusls in the order mentioned above; otherwise, the ghusl should be performed again. In this ghusl, just like other ghusls, the person should intend the ghusl for the purpose of proximity to God, they should then wash the head and the neck, then the right side of the corpse, and then the left side of it. In washing each side, the genital and the navel should be washed. It is not valid to perform the ghusl of the dead by immersion (irtimasi). And it is necessary to clean any nijasa (impurity) from the corpse. Some scholars believe that it is enough to clean nijasas of each part before washing it. The amount of cedar and camphor should not be so large that turns the water into mudaf (mixed) water, and not so little that their presence in the water is not obvious. If cedar or camphor are not available, then it is enough to wash the corpse with pure water, in which case, according to some scholars, one ghusl will suffice. If it is impossible to wash the corpse with water, then tayammum should be performed. However, there is a disagreement as to whether one tayammum is enough or it should be done three times. If one dies with janaba (impurity caused by sexual intercourse or seminal discharge) or menstruation, then the ghusl of the dead is sufficient for its purification and no ghusl for janaba or menstruation is required. However, some scholars cautiously held that the person who washes the corpse should intend both the ghusl of the dead as well as that of janaba or menstruation. Conditions of the Ghusl Performer The person who washes the corpse is called \"ghassal\". A ghassal should be Muslim and Twelver Shiite, mature, and mentally healthy. A male corpse should be washed by a man, and a female corpse should be washed by a woman, except for spouses; a spouse is permitted to wash his or her spouse's corpse. According to jurists , in ordinary conditions washing a corpse by a person of an opposite sex is not legitimate. Some scholars stipulate that a spouse should wash his or her spouse's corpse with clothes on it. If the ghassal wears gloves and does not touch the corpse, then he or she does not have to perform the ghusl of touching a corpse . Receiving Money for the Ghusl of the Dead According to many Shiite scholars of jurist , it is forbidden to receive money for washing a corpse. Some of them believe that such a ghusl is invalid and should be performed again. However, one can receive money for preparatory actions such as cleaning the body.

{"title": "Shafa'a", "text": " Shafāʿa (Arabic: الشفاعة , intercession) is a religious act, all Muslims and followers of divine religions believe in. Shafa'a means that on the Day of Judgment , friends of God and some holy entities such as the Qur'an , with some conditions, intercede for some wrong-doers and rescue them from hellfire or cause the promotion of some people. According to Shiite beliefs, Shafa'a completely belongs to God and nobody can intercede without His permission. If God is satisfied with one's faith , He will permit others to intercede for one. Shafa'a has been explicitly mentioned in Sunni sources stipulating the intercession of the Prophet (s) for believers. Among Muslims, Wahhabis believe that only God can be asked for Shafa'a and if someone asks others for Shafa'a (especially after their demise), he is a polytheist . Belief in Shafa'a has a special position among Shi'a . Definition The word of Shafa'a is derived from the root of \" ش ف ع \" meaning \"to append or join something to another\". Shafi' (intercessor) is called so because they join one to themselves and provide one with what one lacks and thus rescue one. Shafa'a in religious terminology means \"a creature's mediation between God and another creature in delivering the good or driving away the evil whether in this world or in the hereafter.\" Shafa'a means to make a change in the sinner so that the sinner no longer deserves to be punished and exclude one from the law of punishment; like repentance makes a wrongdoer no longer deserve the punishment and makes one deserve receiving God's forgiveness, as Imam 'Ali (a) has said: \"There is no Shafi' (intercessor) more rescuing than repentance.\" Shafi' (intercessor) is called so because this person tries to adjoin someone else to himself and recompense the person's sins. Shafa'a has a close relation with Tawassul (entreaty): Tawassul is the act of one who takes refuge to a person and asks for intercession and thus Shafa'a is the act of the person asking God to forgive that wrongdoer. The belief in Shafa'a also exists in other divine religions such as Judaism and Christianity . In the Qur'an Shafa'a has been clearly stated in the Qur'an in 24 verses many of which negates the pagans' belief in the intercession of idols. \"They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you inform Allah about something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?’ Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]!\" ( Qur'an 10 :18) Although the Qur'an denies the intercession of the idols, it has acknowledged the intercession of some figures such as the Prophet (s) with some conditions. Therefore, Muslims have no disagreement on the principle of Shafa'a in general and disagree only on its rulings and position. For example, in the verse \"And keep vigil for a part of the night, as a supererogatory [devotion] for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to a praiseworthy station.\" ( Qur'an 17 :79) Shi'a and Sunni exegetes agree that by \"a praiseworthy station\", the position of Shafa'a is meant which God has promised to His Messenger (s). The verses mentioned in the Qur'an about Shafa'a can be categorized in some groups, Some of them totally reject Shafa'a in the hereafter, [5] Some regard Shafa'a exclusive to God, [6] Some regard Shafa'a conditioned to the permission and order of God, [7] Some reject Shafa'a about some people. Studying all the verses of Shafa'a, it can be inferred that the Qur'an approves of a kind of Shafa'a and disapproves and rejects other kinds of Shafa'a. The verses which reject Shafa'a imply that no one other than God has such a right and those verses which support Shafa'a imply that Shafa'a belongs to God and others can do Shafa'a only by His permission. “ Intercession is of no avail with Him except for those whom He permits. ” — Quran, 34:23 In Hadiths In hadiths narrated from the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the truth of Shafa'a has clearly been approved and explained. The Prophet (s) stated, \" God blessed me with five privileges… one of which is [the right to make] Shafa'a and I have secured it for my people. Shafa'a will be for those who do not commit polytheism .\" [8] The Prophet (s) also said, \"three groups make Shafa'a for sinners before God and their Shafa'a will be accepted: Prophets (a) , scholars of religion, and the martyrs .\" [9] The hadiths of Shafa'a are in three groups: Hadiths which say that Shafa'a will make a sinner be forgiven from going to the hell . Hadiths which say that some sinners after a while staying in the hell will enjoy Shafa'a and rescued from punishment . Hadiths which say that some people will never enjoy Shafa'a and will eternally remain in hell. Therefore, those hadiths which say that anyone having a particle of faith will enjoy Shafa'a do not disagree those hadiths which say one who does some very wrong acts such as he takes the prayer of little importance will not enjoy Shafa'a, because anyone who believes in God will once enjoy Shafa'a but he will be long left in hell so that some of his impurities will be cleansed and deserve Shafa'a. In the View of Intellect From the point of hadiths, validity of Shafa'a is definite and its rulings are clear; however, Muslim thinkers have mentioned rational justifications as well. Morteza Motahhari wrote, \"Even if there was no traditional justification for Shafa'a, we had to justify it using intellect and rational arguments such as the argument of Imkan Ashraf (the Possibility of the Superior) and the nature of organizational creation. When a person accepts the existence of God 's forgiveness, definite rational principles make him say that forgiveness needs to flow through a total intellect or soul, i.e. the intellect and soul of one who has the position of total divine Wilaya ; and it is not possible that God's mercy reaches creation without order.\" From intellectual point of view, Shafa'a is flowing in the creation and is the requirement of the system of causality . Rational justification is based on two criteria: The general mercy of God : God's mercy is general and reaches all creatures. And if a creature receives a smaller proportion of divine mercy, it would only be due to his own incompetence. Basically, no creature can ever reach happiness and success alone without divine mercy or rescues punishment. Organizational nature of world: from rational viewpoint, the world has an organization and hierarchy. This system of hierarchy is the very same system of causality. Material needs of human beings are fulfilled through a chain of natural causes which all effect by the permission of God. [11] Even though mercy and forgiveness of God is general but it is not excluded from this law and they are impossible to reach the creation without means and this is true about all kinds of divine mercy. For example, revelation which is an instance of God's guidance and mercy is not received by all human beings, but only certain people receive it and other people benefit from it through these people; because no one other than prophets (a) has such a competence to be directly addressed by God. And this is that very hierarchical system of creation. Or for another example, when Istisqa prayer (prayer requesting rain) is made, it is not that it rains without any change in the weather; but due to the Istisqa prayer, God provides all the causes and means of raining including the wind and condensation of clouds. The same way as the Istisqa prayer causes that the requirements for raining are provided, Shafa'a, repentance , and such cause a change in the states of the sinner so that he acquires the competence for forgiveness, decrease of punishment or promotion. The position of Shafa'a in this system is that it promotes a person's competence so that he can more benefit from God's general mercy. It is due to this rationality that if a one lacks perfection, it needs to acquire that perfection from a source of perfection and if it does not have the competence to receive perfection, it needs to develop its competence to necessary level. Such an action not only breaks no rule but it is in fact what rationality requires. Therefore, Shafa'a about a person does not imply that while he is incompetent and lacks the requirements, making Shafa'a will be accepted about him; also, Shafa'a in legislation does not mean to cancel the law and not applying the law about that wrongdoer who is deserved to be punished; rather, Shafa'a means to make such a change in that person so that he would not deserve punishment anymore and he will be excluded from that law of punishment, the same way repentance rescues a person from punishment and makes him deserved of God's forgiveness. Therefore, it is mentioned in hadiths that Shafa'a is the best of Shafi' (intercessor). In other words, the essential difference between the true Shafa'a with a false one is that true Shafa'a initiates from God and ends with the sinner and intercessor is only the means of delivering God's mercy to lower levels; however, in false Shafa'a, like favoring someone, the wrongdoer without having the required competence and only through relation requests for something. Types In Creation and Legislation Shafa'a in creation means that the origin of any action or effect is God and all other causes and means are only means through which God's mercy is delivered to lower levels by His permission. This way, all the causes in the world are intercessors of their effects since they deliver God's mercy to lower levels. For example, the sun is the intercessor of the wheat grain to make it grow. In the Qur'an we read, “ To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that may intercede with Him except with His permission? ” — Qur'an, 2:255 Shafa'a in legislation means that God, out of His mercy, has sent laws for people which guide them and in fact intercede them to enter the paradise . All religious rulings are of this type. False Intercession False Shafa'a is that the wrongdoer acts against the law and influences the will of the lawmaker through an illegal way. Such kind of Shafa'a in this world is an act of oppression and it is impossible in the hereafter . The objections to Shafa'a are mostly of this kind and this is rejected in the Qur'an as well. The false Shafa'a originates from the belief in Tafwid (unrestricted human delegation) which is a wrong belief meaning that after creating the world, God delegated its management to others and He has no role in it and thus people would be able to make Shafa'a independently and if one can attract the intercessors' favor, he would not need God. True Intercession True Shafa'a as mentioned in the Qur'an which is believed by Shi'a and supported by Imams (a) is that Shafa'a in its wholeness belongs to God and no one can make Shafa'a without His permission. Prophets (a) and Imams' (a) Shafa'a never means that they have an independent role or that to be privileged by their Shafa'a, one would need to do anything other than what God has ordered. On the contrary, they would only make Shafa'a for someone, God would be pleased with, “ …and they do not intercede except for someone He approves of,… ” — 21:28, Qur'an For Forgiveness and for Propmotion Sometimes, Shafa'a is for promotion which is accepted by all Islamic schools and sometimes, it is for forgiveness of the sins which some schools such as Mu'tazilites and Kharijites reject. These two schools do not accept that Shafa'a would be made about those who commit capital sins and those who have entered the hell. They say that, \"one who has entered the hell would not exit it.\" Sometimes, Shafa'a is about issues in the hereafter, such as the Shafa'a of the Prophet (s) for the sinners on the Day of Judgment and it is sometimes about issues of this world. If some actions are good, Shafa'a for them is also good, and if it is about sins, it is not only bad but also the intercessor needs to take the responsibility for a part of it. Requirements Due to the educational purpose and avoiding people from being bold in committing sins, the Qur'an and hadiths have not mentioned all the details and requirements for one to be interceded for; however, they have mentioned some necessary requirements. The most important requirement for one to be interceded for is that God approves of him. From the verse of the Qur'an, two requirements can be understood for those who are going to be interceded for: To have taken a covenant with God [18] To be witness to the truth [19] It is obvious that one who needs Shafa'a of forgiveness because of some sins, God does not approve his act; rather, it means that God approves of that person's religion and beliefs. In other words, the one who is going to be interceded for even if is a sinner and has committed greater sins, he must have not cut his relation with God and leaders of religion. Obstacles of Shafa'a From the Qur'an, it can be understood that some issues are obstacles for benefiting from Shafa'a. Some groups who are deprived of Shafa'a are as follows: Disbelievers and polytheists Traitors Hypocrites Oppressors Enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) (Nasibis) Deniers of the Wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) and other Imams (a) Those who harassed the progeny and children of the Prophet (s) Deniers of Shafa'a Those who do not take prayer seriously Those who abandon prayer Intercessors Shafa'a in creation as the influence of causes exists in whole creation. Therefore, in hadiths, the right to make Shafa'a is also mentioned for some places as well as for people and groups and it refers to the effect of such issues in the guidance of people. In Shafa'a of legislation, intercessors are either among the righteous acts of a person, prophets (s), friends of God or other issues. God the Almighty: Since God is All-merciful, after that intercessors make Shafa'a for people on the Day of Judgment, many people who will be deprived of all intercessors' Shafa'a will receive God's Sahfa'a and mercy. [21] The Prophet (s) : the Prophet's (s) Shafa'a is called Shafa'a al-Kubra (great intercession). In different hadiths, it is mentioned that his Shafa'a will include those believers who have committed greater sins . Imam 'Ali (a) Lady Fatima (a) Imams (a) The Qur'an Prophets (a) and friends of God . [22] Angels [23] Repentance : The superiority of the intercession of the prophets (a) and angels over repentance is that their Shafa'a is effective also on the Day of Judgment ; while, repentance is only for this world. Religious scholars [24] Martyrs Effects The nature of Shafa'a is neither encouraging to sin , nor a green light for sinners. It is not a cause of staying behind or mediation either; rather, it is an important educational issue which has constructive effects, some of which are mentioned below: Raising hope: Usually, the power of the self and lowly desires leads to committing great sins and following it, a spirit of disappointment takes over the person and this disappointment leads the person to more corruption. On the contrary, being hopeful in Sahfa'a of the friends of God, as a preventive factor, gives people hope that if they correct themselves, their bad past could be compensated through Shafa'a of the righteous and the pure. Establishing spiritual connection with friends of God: Obviously, someone who hopes in Shafa'a, tries to establish such a relation and does something which pleases them and does not break his cord of love with them, which can lead to doing more good deeds. Trying to Acquire the Prerequisites of Sahafa'a: The hopeful in Shafa'a need to review their deeds in the past and make better decisions about the future for Sahfa'a would not happen without proper background; and that is because Shafa'a is a kind of bestowing mercy which actualizes due to the proper background of the one who is interceded for and also because of the honor, dignity and righteous deeds of the intercessor. [25] Wahhabis and Shafa'a All Sunnis including Wahhabis believe in Shafa'a. The leader of Wahhabis, Ibn Taymiyya said, \"Hadiths about Shafa'a are many and frequently narrated in Sahih Muslim and Sahih al-Bukhari and many of them also exist in Sunan and Masanid.\" Elsewhere he said, \"The Prophet (s) will have three kinds of Shafa'a on the Day of Judgment … The third type of Shafa'a is for those who deserve the hellfire. Shafa'a of the Prophet (s), other prophets (a), the righteous and others is so that a person who deserves the hellfire, will not enter it and it is also for the one who has entered the hellfire (to be rescued).\" They believe in the request of Shafa'a from prophets (a) and the righteous in this world during the lifetime of the intercessors and also on the Day of Judgment. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Hasan b. Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1285/1869) said, \"Asking for Shafa'a from the Prophet (s) during his lifetime is because of his du'a and his du'a is accepted, but after his demise, asking Shafa'a from him is impermissible.\" The disagreement between Wahhabis and other Muslims is over requesting Shafa'a from prophets (a) and friends of God during Barzakh (the Middle World), about which, since Wahhabis do not believe in the life in Barzakh, they regard this kind of Shafa'a impermissible and even consider it an example of polytheism . 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab said, \"We approve of Shafa'a for our prophet (s) on the Day of Judgment according to hadiths. We also approve of it for other prophets (a), angels, friends of God and children due to the reports we have received, but we seek Shafa'a from its owner (God)… Shafa'a needs to be requested from God not intercessors, e.g. one should not say, \"O the Messenger of God! O the friend of God! I ask you Shafa'a or its means. … or similar expressions, which no one other than God has the power upon them. Request for Shafa'a from the intercessors while they are in Barzakh is a kind of polytheism.\" Criticisms of Wahhabis The most important criticisms mentioned by Wahhabis are: Polytheism Asking Shafa'a from the intercessor means to call anyone other than God and this is polytheism in worshiping, because God says, “ \"so do not invoke anyone along with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 72:18 Answer The above criticism comes from Wahhabis' misunderstanding of the meaning of unity of God and polytheism. The true understanding of polytheism and unity of God implies that invoking anyone other than God does not mean polytheism in itself and it is not even forbidden since polytheism refers to cases in which one believes an independent divinity and lordship other than God and Shi'a never believe as such neither about their Imams (a) nor any other beings but for Allah alone. Undoubtedly, invoking Muslims and requesting them for help is a permissible action and they need to help such an invoker as much as they can. On the other hand, when an action is permissible for a person, asking him to do that is permissible as well. When Shafa'a would be permissible for the Prophet (s) and other intercessors, asking Shafa'a from them would also be permissible. Asking people for making du'a for one is permissible in the view of all Muslims such as that we ask someone, \"make du'a for me\"; therefore, asking Shafa'a from a person who has permission for that from God , such as he is asked, \"make Shafa'a for me before God\" is also permissible. To forgive sins, God invites people to ask the Prophet (s) to make du'a for their forgiveness, “ \"Had they, when they wronged themselves, come to you and pleaded to Allah for forgiveness, and the Apostle had pleaded for forgiveness for them, they would have surely found Allah all-clement, all-merciful.\" ” — Qur'an, 4:64 Some tried to explain the meaning of this verse so that, people who have harassed the Prophet (s) needed to ask him for forgiveness; but through a more careful look into the verse, wrongness of this interpretation can be understood so that, if the Prophet (s) was about to forgive people's sin about his own rights, the verse needed to say \"and the Apostle had forgave them\" while the verse says, \"the Apostle had pleaded for them\". Moreover, the above mentioned verse Wahhabis refer to ( Qur'an 72 :18) prohibits Muslims from partnership and association, i.e. that Muslims do not consider anyone at similar level with God. The verse actually addresses polytheists who regarded the means independently. Also, if asking anyone other than God is a polytheistic act, there would be no difference between the life and after death of people and thus no one should ever ask the Prophet (s) or another even during their lifetimes. In authentic Sunni hadiths, it is mentioned that al-Tirmidhi quoted from Anas b. Malik that he asked the Prophet (s) to make Shafa'a for him on the Day of Judgment . He is quoted as saying, \"I asked the Prophet (s) to make Shafa'a for me on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet (s) said, 'I will.' I said, 'where should I look for you then?' He (s) said, 'first near al-Sirat Bridge .'\" Excluding Shafa'a to God The Qur'an considers the right to make Shafa'a exclusive to God, “ \"Say, All intercession rests with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 39:44 Therefore, Shafa'a need to be requested from God alone. Answer Shafa'a from this aspect that it is a kind of making influence in the creation, is among the manifestations of God's Lordship and thus it belongs to Him; however, this does not contradict with believing in the rights of Shafa'a for prophets (a) and the righteous; because, their Shafa'a is not independent but depending on the permission of God while it is the same in other issues. In the Qur'an God says, “ …that power, altogether, belongs to Allah… ” — 2:165, Qur'an which means that all the powers in the world belongs to God and all the creatures gain power by His permission and will and to the extent that He wishes and after God gives a being power, then that being can be asked for help. Also, the verse “ \"Say, 'All intercession rests with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 39:44 means that if God sees it appropriate and gives the right to make Shafa'a to a being, then that being can be requested to use the permission God has given him for the one requesting. Resembling Polytheists In the Qur'an, God considers the polytheists of the time of the Prophet (s) polytheist because they ask Shafa'a from other than God, “ They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.' ” — Qur'an, 10:18 Answer There is no doubt that polytheists of the time of the Prophet (s) considered the rights to ask their idols and gods for Shafa'a, but this verse implies that they worshiped idols and also considered the rights of Shafa'a for them and thus believing in their Shafa'a together with worshiping them led to their criticism. Polytheists considered unconditional rights of Shafa'a for their idols which God never had given them such position. Also, they believed in their divinity and worshiped them; while if one believes in someone's rights of Shafa'a God has given him and that using such rights is by the permission of God, then there would be no problem. On the other hand, no Muslim considers the position of divinity for intercessors to worship them so that his act resembles the acts of the polytheists. It is obvious that only showing respect and kissing Darih in holy shrines without believing in divinity would not be considered as worship; for if it was considered so, then respecting and kissing the hands of parents would also be considered as worshiping them. Another point is that idols made of stone and wood had no permission to harm or benefit and it was only the claim of idol-worshipers who believed in the effects of those stone and wood and their beliefs are different from the effects believed to exist in the Shafa'a of the intercessors by the permission of God. In the above mentioned verse, God addresses the idol-worshipers that, \"you believe in positions for idols I have not given to them. Do you want to give news to God about what (idols' effects) He does not have news about?\" and this is different with asking the friends of God for Shafa'a. This verse has not mentioned anything about asking for Shafa'a; rather it addresses believing in the Shafa'a of idols, \"they say, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.'\" and it has not said, \"they say, make intercession for us before Allah.'\" Therefore, if Wahhabi's reasoning is right, then believing in Shafa'a would be totally polytheistic and this includes Wahhabis as well, because they believe in Shafa'a in general. Hadith Rejecting the Request for Shafa'a from People It is narrated from Imam 'Ali (a) in Nahj al-Balagha saying, \"Know that He Who owns the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth has permitted you to pray to Him and has promised you acceptance of the prayer. He has commanded you to beg from Him in order that He may give you and to seek His mercy in order that He may have mercy on you. He has not placed anything between you and Him that may veil Him from you. He has not required you to get a mediator for you to Him, and if you err, He has not prevented you from repentance.\" Answer Firstly, Shafa'a is among the issues which all of Muslims, even Wahhabis , have accepted and it is mentioned the Qur'an and hadiths . Secondly, by the sentence \"He has not required you to get a mediator for you to Him\", Imam 'Ali (a) meant that God's mercy upon people is not like people's so that when they do not know some people, they refer to some people to introduce them to those people so that they can reach their wishes; because God is the Knower of secrets and the Unseen and knows all humans and their requests directly; but He refers people to the means due to His wisdom and because the causal system in the world of nature and spirituality requires. God Almighty has not made human distressed so that he needs to refer to a mediator or an intercessor; because the need for a mediator is when there is no access to the main person either due to his meanness or ignorance about the rights of the one who requests; while God has no meanness or restriction of access contrary to the opinions of the Christians and polytheists who believe that there needs to be means between God and human beings. Request from Those who have Passed away Wahhabis say that asking Shafa'a from intercessors after their demise is impermissible since it is a polytheistic act and the dead cannot hear the living. Answer If some action are polytheistic, it would be polytheistic both in this world and the hereafter and there would be no difference. Moreover, death is about body, while soul is living and hearing du'as and Shafa'a and answering it is related with the soul not the body. There are many Sunni hadiths about reciting Salawat upon the Prophet (s) and saying Salam (salutation) to him from far or near and it is clarified that the Prophet (s) hears these Salams and praises and answers to them. We Have No Rights to Ask Them Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab says, \"If one says that, 'the Prophet (s) is given the rights to make Shafa'a and I ask him about what God has given to him'; the answer would be that God has given him the rights to make Shafa'a, but He has prohibited you from asking him and has said that, 'so do not invoke anyone along with Allah . (72:18)'\" Answer Firstly, the above verse has no relation with asking for Shafa'a; and it is about the polytheists who considered independent partners for God and asked them their requests and thus such verses cannot be identified with believers. Secondly, as it is mentioned above, the meaning of this verse and other such verses which have come with \" مع \" [with] is that no being should ever be considered at the same level with God, but if one believes that God has given permission to a means or mediator to do something while he considers anything done by the order of God; this would not be an act of polytheism, and it is along with monotheism, the same as when in the Qur'an , Prophet Jesus (a) attributes healing the sick, reviving the dead, and even creating a bird from mud to himself but depending on the permission of God. Deniers of Shafa'a Those who have basically denied Shafa'a have mentioned some reasons: Boldness over Sinning Some believe that believing in Shafa'a causes boldness over sinning in people and revives the spirit of transgression in sinners and criminals; thus, believing in it is not compatible with the spirit of the Islamic law and other laws. Answer Firstly, if it is so, repentance which brings the forgiveness of sins can be considered as encouraging people to sin again; while, repentance is an original Islamic belief and agreed by all Muslims. Secondly, Shafa'a would lead to transgression only if includes all criminals in general; but, if it becomes ambiguous that for what sins and sinners and when on the Day of Judgment , Sahfa'a would be used, then it would not lead to encouragement of sinning. There is No Need for a Mediator God is closer to human beings than their veins and more merciful than anyone to His creation, thus why would we go to anyone other than Him for any request. Answer It is true that God is closer to us than our vein, but the wisdom of creation of human being on earth has required that God sends His messengers to guide people than speaking directly to them and that wisdom also required that the position of these messengers would be high before people so that the guidance would be accomplished in a better way, therefore God granted them infallibility from sinning and error, so that human being would follow them confidently and gave them positions in appearance so that their great positions before God is better known to people and attracted people's hearts to them. In the Qur'an, God mentions some cases and tells people to take these people as mediator in order to reach better results, cases such as the brothers of Prophet Joseph (a) who asked their father to intercede for them and ask God for their forgiveness , or elsewhere introduced the Last Prophet's (s) asking for forgiveness more effective than people's own supplication or mentioned that people referred to prophet Jesus (s) as the divine proof of their time to heal their sick ones and solve their problems. If it was wrong to take a mediator while knowing the closeness of God, it must have been criticized in the Qur'an, not introducing it to people as a recommended act. Justice or Oppression Shafa'a removes the punishment, which is either justice or oppression. If it is justice, then punishment has been God's oppression (God forbids), and if it's not and punishment is justice, then Sahfa'a of intercessors and their action in removing the punishment is oppression. Answer Removing the punishment can be mercy and neither labels of justice or punishment applies about it. In other words, removing punishment is mercy and above justice. God, the Immaculate has determined punishment for wrongdoers according to His justice, but removing punishment due to Shafa'a is mercy and kindness. God has taught His servants to be just and ordered them to try to reach the level higher than justice which is kindness, “ \"Indeed Allah enjoins justice and kindness,…\" ” — Qur'an, 19:90 He also taught His servants that if one did wrong about you, you can punish one due to justice, however it would be better if you forgive one due to patience and kindness.

{"title": "Burial Night", "text": "Burial Night or Laylat al-dafn (Arabic: لَیلَةُ الدَّفن ) is the first night after the burial of a deceased person in grave. In Islamic culture, this night, its characteristics and events have been extensively discussed. According to hadiths , the first night after burial is an important night for the person passed away and has different stages. Among its important events are meeting different angels , questioning the person and receiving his answers and the pressure of the grave . Some actions such as the prayer of burial night can help the deceased person to pass these events. The first night in the grave is beautiful and relaxing for believers and very harsh and dreadful for disbelievers and wrongdoers. Entering the Grave According to hadiths and religious teachings, since the time the person is in his deathbed and the first moments of death approaching, the person sees the result of his actions and will be pleased of or suffer from them. In the first hours and days after death, the soul , while being in the world of Barzakh , finds itself beside the physical body. Due to the great attachment it has had with the body in this world, it is attentive toward it and follows it in the movements and while it is being washed, and then sees itself with the body in the grave, when it is buried. As soon as the deceased person enters the grave, his first night begins and it is the roughest night he inevitably will experience. The states of the deceased person are greatly influenced by his actions, beliefs and his attachment to the material world. Muslim philosophers refer to a hadith of Imam al-Sadiq (a) and interpret \"the grave\" and all its events referring to \"the world of barzakh\". According to this view, entering the grave and the first night in grave begins from the first moments after death and is not related to the burial of the body. The Time of Burial It is recommended to place the body twice on the ground near the grave and wait for some minutes and do not hurry to bury the body, because entering the body to the grave brings about great fear to the soul; so, the delay helps the soul which is with the body to become familiar with the new environment and easily bears that fear. Presence of an Angel called Ruman After burying the body, the first angel visiting it is Malik Ruman. In the third supplication of al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya , Imam al-Sajjad (a) hails to this angel. The job of this angel is reckoning and summing up the actions of people and compiling them in a file for them which will be considered their action records. The person will carry this file, nature of which is unknown to us, until the Day of Judgment , when it will be opened to him and he will be judged accordingly. This angel, based on the person’s actions, advises the next angels to be either harsh or easy on the person. Questions of the Grave Questions of Nakir and Munkar are among the most important events of the first night in grave. They enter the grave after the angel Ruman. One of them stands at the right side of the person and the other at his left side and ask him questions. If the person is a disbeliever or a sinner, he meets those angels having scary faces and they will punish him. His grave will be then filled with fire and thus they will be called Nakir and Munkar. If the person is a believer , he will be able to answer questions with the help of the friends of God and the two angels will meet him with kind and beautiful faces and will give him the good news of entering the paradise and his grave will be expanded with blessings of God. That is when the two angels are called Bashir and Mubashshir. According to hadiths , in this night, the faith of the person will be questioned and that if he believes in God and His Prophet (a) and about whom he took as his leader and Imam in the world. In other hadiths, more questions are mentioned. According to some hadiths, questions and answers of the first night in grave are general and include all human beings. Some scholars have excluded two groups of people from being questioned: people such as Prophets (a) and Imams (a), and those who do not have the requirements for answering such as kids and mentally ill people. 'Allama Majlisi mentioned that there are no clear hadiths in this regard and believed that it is better not to give opinion about it. According to some other hadiths, questions and answers in the grave are for mere believers or disbelievers. Thus, in his Hayat ma ba'd al-mawt , 'Allama Tabataba'i did not consider questions and answers in the grave for common people. Factors for Easy Passage of the First Night in Grave It is recommended that relatives of the deceased person do not leave him after burial and through dictation , help him answer the questions of Nakir and Munkar. In addition to the actions, acts of charity , prayers and the fasting the deceased person has performed, some actions such as gifted prayers and prayer of burial night performed by his relatives are influential in relieving him from or decreasing difficulties of the grave for him. Those without Grave The first night in grave is not only for those who are buried, but also those whose bodies are not buried and destroyed due to burning or explosion, will experience the first night in grave, the questions and also the pressure of the grave . According to one view, all the mentioned issues happen to this material body and God can give the power to perceive and answer to scattered or burned body parts and gives water, air or anything in the world the power to make pressure on or punish the body or its parts; thus, if a body decays in the air, it will not be excluded from this rule. Al-Kulayni narrated that, \" Yunus b. 'Ammar asked Imam al-Sadiq (a) , If a person who was hung up would have punishment of grave as well? Imam (a) answered: \"Yes, God, the Almighty will order the air to surround him with pressure.\" According to philosophers, since the grave is interpreted as the world of barzakh , its night is especial to it and the first night in grave does not necessarily begin after the deceased person is buried. The Relation between the Material Grave, the Soul and the World of Barzakh There is an especial relation between the grave in barzakh and the grave in this world, i.e. there is a relation between the soul in barzakh and the material body in the grave. It comes originally from the relation between the soul and the material body which have a kind of unity during the life in this world. With death, this relation does not completely break, but a weak relation between the soul in barzakh and the material body remains. Thus, the material grave is related with the grave in barzakh and the soul which is present in a supernatural world is attentive toward the material body and the place where it is buried. It is because of this relation between the material grave and the grave in barzakh that there are certain rulings about the material grave, funeral , shrouding , burial , respecting graves, recommendation of visiting graves, making supplication and asking for forgiveness upon graves and as such in Islam . This relation between the soul in barzakh and the material body in the material grave will remain in the next hours and days after death due to the great attachment the soul has had with the material body in this world. This attention and relation gradually decreases after the soul finds attachment with the body in barzakh and the ideal form and only a weak relation remains between the soul and the material body thereafter. Pressure of the Grave One of the certain events which will happen in the grave is the pressure of the grave referred to in hadiths as \"Daghtat al-qabr\" ( ضغطة القبر ). Companions of Imams (a) have frequently asked them about it and also asked if it included everyone. Abu Basir asked Imam al-Sadiq (a): If a person would be relieved of the pressure of the grave? Imam (a) answered: \"The refuge of God is to be sought for the pressure of the grave, for how few people would be relieved of the pressure of the grave.\" The Prayer of Burial Night In hadiths, it is recommended ( Mustahab ) that people perform the prayer of burial night for the deceased person at the first night after his burial. It is known among people as Salāt al-Wahsha and is recommended to be performed in either way below: To perform a two-rak'a prayer, on the first rak'a of which, after reciting sura al-Fatiha , Ayat al-Kursi should be recited once and in the second rak'a, after reciting sura al-Fatiha, sura al-Qadr should be recited ten times and after saying salam (last phrase of prayer), the following phrase should be recited: \" «أللهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلی مُحمّدٍ و ‌آلِ مُحمّدٍ وَ ابعَث ثَوابَها إلی قبرِ فلان \", but instead of \" فلان \", the name of the deceased person should be mentioned. To perform a two-rak'a prayer, on the first rak'a of which, after reciting sura al-Fatiha, sura al-Tawhid should be recited twice and on the second rak'a, after reciting sura al-Fatiha, sura al-Takathur should be recited and after the prayer, the following phrase should be recited: \" «أللهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلی مُحمّدٍ و ‌آلِ مُحمّدٍ وَ ابعَث ثَوابَها إلی قبرِ فلان \", but instead of \" فلان \", the name of the deceased person should be mentioned. This prayer is recommended (Mustahab) to be performed after burial, even if there are some days of delay between the death and the burial. It is to be performed since the beginning of the night until fajr , but it is better to be performed at the beginning of the night after 'Isha prayer . The Meaning of Day and Night in Barzakh About the world of barzakh, it should be said that even though it is not completely known to us, but it can be learned from some verses and hadiths that time exists in barzakh. But what is the meaning of day and night in barzakh is a truth the details of which cannot be perceived by us easily, because time as known to us with sunrise and sunset which make day and night does not exist in barzakh, unless it is said that since the teachings of revelation are for the people in this world, then morning and night have been used in references and the statement such as \"their punishment in the mornings and nights in barzakh\" is used, so that it can be comparable to this world; however, there is no actual sunrise or sunset there. Therefore, the same way it is said that there is no matter in the world of barzakh while there are forms, sizes and volumes the same as the material world; the same is said about time and place; and, the first \"night\" in grave is a relative address.

{"title": "Hanut", "text": "Ḥanūṭ (Arabic: حَنوط ) refers to wiping camphor on seven parts of the dead body of a Muslim which touch the ground in prostration . It is obligatory and mixing it with the Soil of Imam al-Husayn's (a) grave is recommended . Meaning and Usage In jurisprudential terminology, \"hanut\" refers to camphor wiped over seven parts of the dead body (or the shroud of a dead person), by which the dead body is scented. Wiping camphor on the dead body is called \"tahnit\". Rules of Hanut Wiping camphor on the dead body of a Muslim is obligatory; but, wiping it on the dead body of a person who is wearing ihram clothes is not permissible because using fragrance is not permissible for a person wearing ihram. However, wiping camphor on the dead body of a woman during her idda of death and also wiping camphor on the dead body of a person who has been mu'takif is obligatory while using perfume has been forbidden for them (when they were alive) and they do not join in the rule of those who wear ihram clothes. There are disagreements on whether wiping camphor on the dead body should be performed before shrouding it, after it, or after putting the loincloth and before putting on the shirt or whether it is permissible to be performed in any of the mentioned cases. However, it is better if it is performed before shrouding. Method of Hanut There is a disagreement about the method of hanut. Some jurists consider wiping camphor on different parts of the dead body obligatory and some others have considered only touching camphor with the body sufficient and have considered wiping it as recommended . Parts of the Body for Hanut The obligatory parts of the body in hanut are the seven parts of the body which touch the ground in prostration as following, The forehead, the palms of both hands, two knees, tips of the toes and according to some views, the tip of nose. Some consider performing hanut for the tip of the nose as recommended; and some have considered it recommended to be performed as well on the armpit, jugular notch, under the knee, joints, the soles, back of the hands, and every part of the body which sweats and emits bad smell. It is recommended to wipe the extra camphor remained on the chest of the dead body. Inserting camphor in the eyes, ears and the nose of the dead body are makruh (reprehensible). Amount of Hanut The common view is that the obligatory amount of hanut is as much as it is called so. However, some jurists have said that it should be at least the size of one dirham and less than that is not sufficient. According to the mentioned common view, it is recommended that it should not be less than one dirham or according to another report, it should not be less than one mithqal , and it is better if it is about four dirhams or according to another report, four mithqals, and it is even better if it amounts to thirteen dirhams and one third of a dirham. If camphor is not available, the dead body will be buried without hanut. However, scenting the dead body is permissible using dharira, but it is not considered hanut. There is a disagreement on whether scenting the dead body with anything other than camphor or dharira is reprehensible or forbidden . Mixing camphor with dharira for hanut is permissible. If there is little camphor which is not sufficient to be used for both the ghusl of the dead body and hanut, it should be used for ghusl and between performing hanut on the forehead and other parts, the forehead is prior. Manners Mixing camphor with the soil from the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) is recommended, but it should not be wiped over the parts which would be considered as disrespect. Also, according to some sources' clear statement, it is recommended that performing hanut begins from the forehead. The appearance of some sources' statements implies its obligation .

{"title": "Ihtidar", "text": "Iḥtiḍār (Arabic: الإحتضار ) is a terminology in fiqh (jurisprudence) which means the presence of death . A person who is about to die and whose soul is about to leave his body is called \"muḥtaḍar\"( مُحتَضَر ). When a person is in such a state, people around him have certain jurisprudential obligations . Definition \"Ihtidar\" literally means \"presence\". In the religious terminology, it means the presence of death and the arrival of the time at which one's soul leaves the body. In the Qur'an In the Qur'an 4 in the Qur'an , \"ihtidar\" is characterized as the presence of death and it is emphasized that tawba of sinners is not accepted when they are in this state. The Qur'an 5 refers to the pains and hardships suffered by unjust people in this state while the angels talk to them. And according to the Qur'an 56 , remind people who deny the truth of the Qur'an that there will be a time at which their life comes to their throat and they are asked to return a \"muhtadar\" to life, if they can. In Hadith According to some hadiths, the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) go to the \"muhtadar\"; if he or she is a believer, then they give them the good news of going to the Heaven and if they are unbelievers, then they notify them of the divine anger. The believer is given the option to go back to this world, but upon seeing their place in the Heaven, they choose to go to the Afterlife . After seeing their place in the Heaven, some believers ask to go back to this world just to inform their family and friends about their position in the Afterlife, but they are not given the permission to do so. Practices There are certain jurisprudential rulings for ihtidar which are referred to as \"manners or practices of ihtidar\". It is a collective obligation for all Muslims to lay the body of a Muslim who is about to die on his back such that his or her soles are in the direction of the qibla . It is mustahab or recommended to suggest shahadatayn to a person who is about to die, that is, shahadatayn should be recited in order for the muhtadar to repeat it. If the person suffers too much pain while dying, it is recommended that they be moved to the place where they usually said their prayers . It is also recommended to recite the Qur'an near the \"muhtadar\", particularly the Qur'an , the Qur'an 37 and the Qur'an 33 . It is also recommended to recite Al-'Adila Supplication when a person is about to die. And it is recommended to suggest the following supplications to the \"muhtadar\": \"O God! Forgive my many sins! And accept my little bit of obedience\" ( اللهم اغفر لی الکثیر من معاصیک، واقبل منی الیسیر من طاعتک ), \"O Who Accepts the little and Forgives the many, Accept my little and Forgive my many; truly Thou Are the Pardoning, the Forgiving\" ( یا من یقبل الیسیر ویعفو عن الکثیر، اقبل منی الیسیر واعف عنی الکثیر، إنک أنت العفو الغفور ). It is unfavorable for a junub or a Menstruating woman to be near the muhtadar, as it is unfavorable to leave the muhtadar alone with women, to put an iron stuff on muhtadar's stomach, to cry, and to talk too much near the muhtadar.

{"title": "Munkar and Nakir", "text": "Munkar and Nakīr (Arabic: منكَر و نَكير ) or Mubashshir and Bashīr (Arabic: مًبشر وبَشير ) are the names of two angels who enter upon a dead one's grave at his/her burial night who look into beliefs and actions of the deceased. If the person died as an unbeliever, then the angels would appear with an ugly face, \"Munkar\" and \"Nakir\". If he or she died a believer, then they would greet him/her with a beautiful face, in which case they are called \"Mubashshir\" and \"Bashir\". Names of the Two Angels When the corpse is buried , two angels who are commissioned by God to examine the dead person's beliefs enter his or her grave. In some hadiths , they are called \"the two guardians of the grave\". One of the two angels stands at the right side of the dead and the other at his or her left side, and they start interrogating the dead person by asking questions about his or her beliefs. If the person is an unbeliever or a sinner, then the two angels appear to him or her with a frightening face, and when the true character of the dead is revealed, he or she will face a torture by the frightening angels, called Munkar and Nakir, and the grave will be filled with fire. But if the departed is a believer and pious , then the angels will appear to him or her with a beautiful face, and after the interrogation, they give him or her the good news of going to the Heaven and expand the grave with divine bounties. The angels are, in this case, called \"Mubashshir\" and \"Bashir\". The Face of Munkar and Nakir The appearance of Munkar and Nakir is described in hadiths as follows: they have a voice like a thunderstorm, and eyes like a dazzling light from which fire comes out. They have long and terrifying teeth that reach the ground, their shouts horrifies the dead person to the extreme and makes him or her mute. The way they treat the dead one depends on his or her beliefs, and their appearances change when they face different people. The person's ability to answer their questions depends on the true spirit that he or she had in this world. Sinful believers might have difficulty answering some questions and come to be tortured. Factors that Make It Easier for the Dead to Answer the Questions Expressions such as the \"predicament of Munkar and Nakir\" or the \"horror of Munkar and Nakir\", that are found in hadiths, imply the anxiety or fear that a dead person feels when seeing the two angels. It is recommended to recite Qur'an 67 on behalf of the departed in order to relieve their fears and anxieties. There are some supplications in which God is asked to help one to go through this difficult stage. The family and relatives of the dead person are recommended not to leave him or her alone after their burial. They had better stay with the dead by reciting the Qur'an and supplications, and help him or her answer the questions of Munkar and Nakir. Another factor that helps the dead, in addition to the right beliefs and good actions, is to visit Ahl al-Bayt (a) , especially Imam al-Husayn (a) . This is in fact an appeal to their intercession .

{"title": "Lahad", "text": "Laḥad (Arabic: لَحَد ) is a rectangle hole dug at the bottom of the grave to the side facing the qibla where Muslims burry the body of a dead one of theirs. The philosophy of closing lahad is known to be that the soil does not reach the corpse. Muslim jurists have considered closing of lahad recommended and Shia jurists have advised it to be hardened with mud and to recite a special du'a while placing lahad stones. Meaning Lahad is a rectangle hole dug at the side of the bottom of the grave. To create lahad, the side of the bottom of the grave which faces the qibla is dug in rectangle form to a size which fits the body of the dead one. Adobes, stones or the like with which lahad is covered are called lahad stones. Ruling According to Shia jurists, digging lahad for burying the dead body is recommended . If the ground is soft, it is better to dig a \"Shaqq\" (a rectangle shaped hole at the bottom of the grave where the dead body is placed and its top is covered) instead of lahad. Based on Shia jurisprudence , it is recommended to cover lahad with adobe. Its philosophy is that the soil does not reach the corpse. It is also permissible to use stone, straws, wood or anything that prevents soil to reach the corpse. However, Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi , the author of Jawahir al-kalam , considered covering lahad with adobe to be better. Based on a hadith in Tahdhib , also Imam Ali (a) made a will to Imam al-Hasan (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) to cover his lahad with adobe. According to another hadith, Imam Ali (a) covered lahad of the Prophet (s) with adobe. However, according to Sayyid Muhammad Sa'id al-Hakim (d. September 3 , 2021)), among Shiite marja's , hardening the cover of the grave is recommended even by using materials other than adobe. Some Sunni jurists have considered using wood and clay to be disliked for covering lahad. Manners Shiite jurists, based on hadiths, have said that it is better to harden lahad stone with mud and to recite the du'a below upon placing the stone: “O God … take care of his loneliness, and appease his fear, … and soothe him with your mercy, a mercy that will make him needless of the mercy of anyone other than you…” It is narrated from al-Qutb al-Rawandi , a hadith scholar and Shia jurist of 6th/12th century, that Shiites begin placing lahad stones from the head of the dead body. Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi, the author of Jawahir al-kalam , believes that the reason for that is due to the higher importance of the head over other limbs of the body.

{"title": "Istijari Prayer", "text": " Istījārī prayer or al-ṣalāt al-istījārīyya (Arabic: الصَّلاة الإستیجاریة ) is a prayer said by a muslim on behalf of another muslim in exchange for an amount of money. Istijari prayers can be obligatory, such as the qada' of daily prayers of the deceased, and can be mustahab , such as the ziyara prayer . The person who undertakes an istijari prayer is called \"ajir\" (hired). The majority of Shiite jurists maintain that istijari prayers are only permissible on behalf of deceased persons. Definition An istijari prayer is an obligatory or mustahab prayer said on behalf of someone else in exchange for money. If someone says prayer on behalf of another person without receiving money, his prayer will be called \"niyabati prayer\" (subrogative prayer). In the jurisprudential literature, the person who says prayers on behalf of another person is called \"ajir\" or \"na'ib\" (surrogate), and the person on whose behalf the prayer is said is called \"manub 'anh\" (the surrogated). Jurisprudential Ruling Jurists have discussed the istijari prayer and its rulings under the sections of tahara (cleanliness), prayer , khums , and ijara . According to the Shiite jurisprudence, an istijari prayer on behalf of a living person is not valid. However, it is said that Ibn al-Mutawwaj held that a mustahab istijari prayer performed on behalf of a living person is valid. All Shiite jurists believed that performing obligatory and mustahab prayers on behalf of a deceased person without receiving money, and performing mustahab prayers on behalf of a deceased person in exchange for money are valid. But there is a disagreement among them as to the validity of performing obligatory prayers on behalf of a deceased person in exchange for money. It is claimed that the majority of scholars permit an istijari prayer on behalf of deceased people. Related Rulings In an istijari prayer, it is obligatory to observe the order between noon, afternoon, evening and 'isha' prayers. An istijari prayer should be done with mustahab actions that are usually practiced while saying prayers. In an istijari prayer, one should intend saying the prayer on behalf of a particular person, even if one does not know his or her name.

{"title": "Prayer of Burial Night", "text": "              Ṣalāt Laylat al-Dafn (Arabic: صَلاة لیلة الدّفن ) (the Burial Night Prayer) or Ṣalāt al-Hadīyya (Arabic: صَلاة الهَدیّة ) (the Gift Prayer) or Ṣalāt al-Waḥsha (Arabic: صَلاة الوَحشَة ) (the Loneliness or Alienation Prayer) is one of the recommended prayers , which is performed for a dead person at his/her first night after the burial . The best time for performing this prayer is after 'Isha' Prayer . Names This prayer is called Salat Laylat al-Dafn (the Burial Night Prayer) or Salat al-Hadiyya (the Gift Prayer) or Salat al-Wahsha (the Loneliness or Alienation Prayer). How to Perform According to jurisprudential sources, there are two ways of performing this prayer: In the first rak'a after the Qur'an 1 , recite the Qur'an 112 twice and in the second rak'a after the Qur'an 1, recite the Qur'an 102 ten times and after the Salam of the prayer say: Allahumm-a sall-i 'Ala Muhammad-in wa Al-i Muhammad, wa b'ath thawab-a-ha ila qabr-i (mention the name of the deceased person).

[4] Rulings It is better to perform the prayer in both ways. [5] The prayer could be performed anytime from Maghrib (a time just after sunset) to morning of the first night after burial, but it is better to be performed at early night after Isha' prayer . [6] The prayer must be performed at the first night after burial, so if the burial is postponed, performing the prayer should be postponed as well.

{"title": "Touching a dead human body", "text": "This section is a general introduction to the rulings of a fiqhi topic. Mass-i mayyit (Arabic: مَسّ مَیِّت ) means touching a dead human body. In the books of jurisprudence , touching a dead human body is mentioned in the chapter of the rulings of purity . Rulings of touching a dead human body According to the fatwas of Shia jurists , contact with the body of a dead person results in the obligation of ghusl if the dead body is cold and the contact is made before the ghusl of the dead body . [3] Touching the body of an Infallible person, a martyr of battle, and a person who has performed ghusl of the dead body before receiving prescribed penalty or retributory punishment does not entail the ghusl due to touching the dead human body. [4] However, some jurists have considered it possible that touching the martyr’s body entails the ghusl due to touching the dead human body. [5] The viewpoint among the majority of the jurists is that touching a dead human body does not invalidate wudu , [6] but some jurists believe that touching a dead human body invalidates wudu. [7] According to the fatwa of most marja's , touching a part separated from the human body, if it has bones, entails the mentioned ghusl. [8] On the other hand, Ayatollah Sistani believes that touching a part separated from the human body, even if it has bones and flesh, does not entail the ghusl. [9] According to some jurists, ghusl due to touching the dead human body is obligatory only for religious obligations that require wudu; such as performing prayer and touching the text of the Qur'an . Some consider touching the dead human body as a major ritual impurity (al-hadath al-akbar) [major invalidator of ablution]. Therefore, they consider it obligatory for all actions that require purity , such as daily prayer , circumambulation of the Ka'ba , fasting , and stopping at the mosque .

{"title": "Talqin", "text": "Talqīn al-mayyit (Arabic: تلقین المیت ) consists in some phrases regarding Islamic beliefs that are recited for the deceased before burying his or her corpse. Talqin is a recommended part of burying a corpse, according to jurisprudence , it had better be performed both before and after filling the grave with soil when participants of the funeral return. Talqin is also recommended when the person is about to die. The phrases for Talqin mentioned in Mafatih al-jinan come from different hadiths in this regard. The phrases are slightly different for men and women. History Talqin was common since the time of the Prophet (s) . Shiite Imams (a) also taught their followers how to do talqin a deceased person. According to a hadith from the Prophet (s): \"do talqin to your deceased with \"Lā ilāha illā Allāh\" (Arabic: لا اله الّا الله ) (there is no god except Allah) before their death. He whose last word is \"lā ilāha illā Allāh\" will go to the Heaven .\" According to Shiite sources, the testimony for imamate comes after the testimony for tawhid and also prophethood of the Prophet (s). Procedures Al-'Allama al-Majlisi devised a procedure for talqin in his Bihar al-anwar on the basis of hadiths . The same procedure is also cited in the addenda of Mafatih al-jinan . Here is the procedure: When the corpse is placed inside the grave, the knots of the shroud should be untied and soil should be placed on the corpse's face with a headrest of soil and some clod on its back. And before filling the tomb with soil, one should put his hand on the corpse's shoulder, approaching his mouth to the corpse's ears, and while shaking the corpse, recite a supplication three times. Effect According to hadiths , talqin and similar practices help one after their death, though they do not have a decisive role. The main decisive factor in one's life after death is their own deeds and beliefs throughout their worldly lives. Some misdeeds may neutralize the effects of talqin, as Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to say: \"at the time of the Prophet (s) , a man from Medina was sick and about to die, and he lost his ability to talk. The Prophet (s) went to him and told him: \"say that there is no god except Allah\". The man could not reiterate the phrase. There was a woman there. The Prophet (s) asked her: \"is his mother still alive?\" She replied: \"I am his mother.\" The Prophet (s) told her: \"are you satisfied with him?\" \"No\", she answered. The Prophet (s) asked her to forgive him, and she did so. Then the Prophet (s) told him to say \"La ilaha ill Allah\" (there is no god except Allah), and this time he could reiterate it.

{"title": "Gardens of Eden", "text": "Jannāt ʿAdn (Arabic: جنّات عَدن ) or Gardens of Eden , meaning perpetual gardens and heavens, is the name of a heaven or a city in the Heaven . Quranic exegetes believe that \"Jannat 'Adn\" are superior to other gardens of the Heaven. In a hadith from the Prophet (s) , Gardens of Eden are described as being what no eyes have ever seen and what has never occurred to any heart. However, there are sensible descriptions of this heaven in some Quranic verses. Residents of Gardens of Eden are said to include different groups such as prophets , the sincere , martyrs , believers , and mujahids . Introduction The word, \"jannat\", is the plural form of \"janna\" meaning garden and heaven, and the word, \"'adn\", means residence and settlement. \"'Adn\" in the Qur'an has been interpreted by exegetes as perpetuity and eternity, and \"Jannat 'Adn\" has been interpreted as perpetual or eternal heavens. The phrase has occurred eleven times in the Qur'an, in all of which it appears in the plural form. It occurs both in Makki and Madani suras of the Qur'an. Some exegetes believe that \"Gardens of Eden\" are superior to other gardens of the Heaven. There are two views of the \"Gardens of Eden\": Some exegetes believe that it is a proper name, [10] referring to one of the heavens. [11] Others take it to name a city [12] in the middle of the Heaven. [13] However, other exegetes believe that \"'Adn\" is an attribute of the Heaven, and all heavens count as 'adn indeed. [14] Muhammad Darwaza , a contemporary Sunni exegete, believes that God describes afterlife places with reference to well-known places in this world. Before the promotion of Muhammad (s) to prophethood , there was a place called \"Adnat\" in Yemen with well-known gardens. The word transformed into \"'Adn\" and was deployed by the Qur'an in the description of the Heaven or one of the afterlife heavens. Attributes There is a hadith in which the Prophet of Islam (s) describes the \"Gardens of Eden\" as what no eyes have ever seen and what has never occurred to a heart. However, there are sensible descriptions of this heaven in some Quranic verses. In Qur'an 9 , it is described as a garden in which streams flow and pleasant dwellings are located. In Qur'an 18 , it is described as being adorned with bracelets of gold and green garments of silk and brocade on their inhabitants. According to Qur'an 38 , residents of the Gardens of Eden recline on thrones, are provided with abundant fruits and drinks, and there will be with them wives that have their glances only on them. According to hadiths, the heavenly river of \"Tasnim\" springs from the Gardens of Eden. Residents The Prophet (s) is quoted as saying that three groups of people will reside in the Gardens of Eden: prophets , the sincere , and martyrs . Other groups of people are also said to reside in this heaven: In Qur'an 9 , male and female believers are promised to be taken to the Gardens of Eden. [22] People who stay steadfast on, and do not break their promise to God ; those who stay patient for the sake of their Lord, hold prayers and donate privately and publicly. [23] Those who believe in God and His Messenger (s), and perform jihad with their lives and property. [24] Those who repent, believe, and do righteous actions. [25] In some hadiths, Shi'as of Ali (a) are characterized as kings of the Gardens of Eden. [26] Notes References Names and Degree Heavenly Bounties Inhabitants of Heaven Related Concepts"}
{"title": "Heaven of Adam (a)", "text": "Heaven of Ādam (a) was the first residence of Adam (a) and Eve early after their creation. The Heaven of Adam (a) is mentioned in three Suras of the Qur'an . In this Heaven, Adam (a) and Eve enjoyed a great deal of blessings , but they were warned not to approach a certain tree and not to eat its fruit. They were, however, tempted by Satan and ate the fruit of the Forbidden Tree , and as a result, they were ousted from the Heaven. There are three views about the location of the Heaven of Adam (a): a garden on the Earth, a barzakhi (or mid-world) Heaven in the skies, and the \" promised Heaven \". Views about the Quality of the Heaven of Adam (a) There are three views about the Heaven in which Adam (a) and Eve lived: An Earthly heaven : Some people believe that the Heaven in which Adam (a) and Eve lived was a green garden on the Earth full of trees. The view appeals to the idea that since the Satan is forbidden from entering the afterlife Heaven, people there cannot be tempted by Satan and so, they cannot make any mistakes. Also, people who enter the Heaven will live there forever and will never leave it, while Adam (a) was tempted by Satan in the Heaven in which he lived and was ousted from there. There are some hadiths according to which the Heaven of Adam (a) was not the Heaven of afterlife . [1] The promised Heaven : According to some hadiths , the Heaven of Adam (a) was the afterlife Heaven. [2] Some people appealed to the first sermon of Imam 'Ali (a) in Nahj al-balagha to argue for this view: Imam 'Ali (a) said, \"God promised Adam (a) to return him to the Heaven\". [3] This remark indicates that Adam (a) will return to the Heaven , that is the place where he originally lived, and since Adam (a) will go to the afterlife Heaven in the future, it is implied that the Heaven in which he originally lived was the Heaven of afterlife. Barzakhi (mid-world) Heaven : according to this view, the Heaven of Adam (a) was neither the promised Heaven of the afterlife, nor an Earthly garden; rather it was a mid-world Heaven located in the middle of this world and the afterlife. This Heaven has some features of the promised Heaven such as constant liveliness and lack of pain, hunger, thirst, cold and heat, as well as some features of Earthly gardens, such as openness to Satan and his temptations. This view is a mixture of the previous two views. [4] Quranic Account of the Heaven of Adam In the Suras of al-Baqara , al-A'raf , and Taha , the Qur'an mentions the Heaven of Adam (a) in the story of the creation of Adam (a) and Eve. According to Quranic verses, the original residence of Adam (a) and Eve was the Heaven.

{"title": "Heaven", "text": "Heaven or al-Janna (Arabic: الجنة ) is, according to Muslims , a place in the Afterlife where righteous and prosperous people will reside and enjoy divine blessings. The place where Adam (a) and Eve lived before their fall (hubut) to the Earth, is also referred to as \"al-Janna\". There are over two hundred verses of the Qur'an as well as many hadiths from the Infallibles (a) with regard to the Heaven and its features, such as its vastness, the number of Heavens, variety and features of its blessings, things in the Heaven, the purpose of the creation, the characteristics of its residents, characters and actions that make one deserve to reside in the Heaven, people who are deprived of the Heaven, and the relationship between residents of the Heaven. Although the belief in the Heaven is a crucial Islamic doctrine, there are disagreements among Muslim theologians over whether the Heaven will be created in the Afterlife or it is already created. Moreover, Muslim scholars, both Shi'as and Sunnis , dispute over whether the Heaven and its blessings are corporeal or spiritual. The Notion and Related Terms The Heaven is a place in the Afterlife where righteous and prosperous people will reside and enjoy divine blessings. In Qur'an There are over two hundred Qur'anic verses and many hadiths from the Infallibles (a) with regard to the Heaven. Here are the themes of Qur'anic verses regarding the Heaven: features of the Heaven, its main characteristics, the vastness and the type of its space, variety of its blessings, features of its blessings, purpose of the creation of the Heaven, what makes people deserve the Heaven, what deprives people of the Heaven, and finally, the relationship between the residents of the Heaven. In addition to emphasizing the end of the world and occurrence of the resurrection and the beginning of a new life in the Afterlife , the Qur'an refers to the Heaven in different ways: 1-\"Jannat\" (literally meaning the garden; its plural form is: \"Jannāt\", الجنات ): it has occurred over 100 times in the Qur'an. It is sometimes used with another noun or adjective, such as \"Jannat al-Khuld\" ( جنّة الخلد , the Garden of Eternity), \"Jannat al-Na'im\" ( جنة النعیم , the Garden of Bliss), \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\" ( جنّة المأوی , the Garden of Abode), \"Jannāt 'Adn\" ( جنّاتُ عدن , Gardens of Eden), and \"Jannāt al-Firdaws\" ( جنّات الفردوس , Gardens of Paradise). 2-\"Rawḍa\" ( روضة , Garden): in Qur'an 30 :15. 3-\"Rawḍāt al-Jannāt\" ( روضات الجنات , Meadows of Gardens): in Qur'an 42 :22. 4-\"Firdaws\" ( فردوس , Paradise): in Qur'an 23 :11. 5-\"Dār al-Salām\" ( دارالسلام , Home of Peace): in Qur'an 6 :127 and Qur'an 10 :25. It is a name and a feature of the Heaven. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, since \"Salam\" (Peace) is a Divine Name, \"Dar al-Salam\" means the Home of God , which shows the value of the Heaven. 6-\"Dār al-Ākhira\" ( دارالآخرة , Home of the Hereafter ): it occurs nine times in the Qur'an. 7-\"Dār al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , Home of Eternity): in Qur'an 41 :28. 8-\"Dār al-Muqāma\" ( دارَالْمُقامه , Home of Everlasting Dwelling): in Qur'an 35 :35. 9-\"Dār al-Qarār\" ( دارُالْقرار , Enduring Home): in Qur'an 40 :39. 10-\"Dār al-Muttaqīn\" ( دارُالْمتّقین , Home of the Pious): in Qur'an 16 :30. 11-\"Maqām 'Amīn\" ( مَقامٍ امین , Secure Place): in Qur'an 44 :51. 12-\"Maq'ad Sidq\" ( مقعدِ صدق , Seat of Truth): in Qur'an 54 :55. 13-\"'Illīyyūn/'Illīyyīn\" ( علّیین/ علّیون , High Place): in Qur'an 83 :18-19. 14-\"Ḥusnā\" ( حُسنی , the Best): in Qur'an 10 :26 and other verses. Abd Allah b. Abbas is quoted as saying that each of the phrases, \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\", \"Jannat al-Na'im\", \"Dar al-Khuld\" or \"Jannat al-Khuld\", \"Dar al-Salam\", \"Jannat al-Firdaws\", \"Janna 'Adn\" and \"Dar al-Jalal\" refers to a particular heaven. In his collection of hadiths, Bihar al-anwar , al-Allama al-Majlisi cited Qur'anic verses concerning \"Jannat\" (which are about 275) in the order of the Qur'anic suras , and then cited their exegeses from al-Tabrisi , al-Fakhr al-Razi , and al-Baydawi . In Hadiths In some hadiths from the Infallibles (a) , the names of the Heaven in the Qur'an are explained; for example: 1-According to a hadith from the Prophet Muhammad (s) , \"Jannat al-Ma'wa\" is the name of a river in the Heaven. And \"Jannat 'Adn\" and \"Jannat al-Firdaws\" are names of two heavens in the middle of two other heavens. 2-According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the Qur'an has mentioned four heavens; Jannat 'Adn, Firdaws, Na'im, and Ma'wa, while there are many heavens around these four heavens. 3-According to a hadith transmitted by Su'ayd b. Janah from Imam al-Baqir (a), the Qur'an 55 :46 and 62, are evidences for the existence of four heavens. One of the two heavens in the former verse is a reward for abstaining from sins , and the other is a result of fearing to stand before God (people who are very close to God) and the two heavens referred to in Qur'an 55:62 (Na'im and Ma'wa) belong to Companions of the Right Hand : these heavens are closer to God, though there is less bliss there. 4-According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Qur'an 55:62 is evidence for there being numerous heavens, and the term, \"darajāt\" (degrees), reveals differences between residents of the Heaven with respect to their rankings. 5-According to some Shiite and Sunni hadiths, there is a heaven which is directly created by God and its trees are directly planted by Him; its sceneries are never seen by anyone and its bliss is not known by anyone. Some exegetes of the Qur'an take the verse seventeen of Qur'an 32 to refer to this heaven. In a hadith, Imam al-Sadiq (a) talked about God's manifestation for residents of the Heaven and then referred to this particular heaven. There are hadiths in many Shiite and Sunni collections to the effect that there is a heaven whose bounties are beyond human imaginations. Features and Characteristics Some features of the Heaven are mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) . According to the Qur'an, the Heaven is a place where prosperous people reside in the Afterlife : gardens with many green and dense trees with rivers streaming beneath them, springs, various fruits, and a moderate temperature. According to the Qur'an 3 :133 and the Qur'an 57 :21, the Heaven is as wide as the skies and the Earth. Exegetes of the Qur'an such as al-Tabrisi , al-Fakhr al-Razi and Allama Tabataba'i , have appealed to these verses to show that it is beyond the human mind to conceive the vastness of the Heaven. The Heaven is Corporeal and already Created Some hadiths have pointed out that the Heaven is created before the occurrence of the resurrection . It has been known as a Shiite belief. There is a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) according to which the Heaven is created in the sense that it has an external existence, and that the Prophet (s) saw the real Heaven in his Mi'raj . Thus, if someone rejects that the Heaven is created, they will thereby deny the Prophet (s). Some hadiths have emphasized that for every person there is a specific, predetermined place in the Heaven as well as in the Hell . A person's actions gradually build up that place in the Heaven or the Hell during time. Such hadiths have been appealed to for the existence of the Heaven and the Hell right now. The Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) emphasize that the Heaven, and in general, the Afterlife, are corporeal or physical. Thus, there is no difference between this mundane world and the Afterlife with respect to their being physical. They are different in other respects. Al-Allama al-Majlisi and Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri have appealed to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) to show that the states of the Afterlife should be measured with those of this world. They maintain that this doctrine implies the corporeality of the Heaven. In response to a question by 'Imran al-Sabi and as an argument for the invisibility of God for human beings in the Heaven, Imam al-Rida (a) said that one can argue for what happens in the Heaven only by what happens in this world. According to the interpretation of al-Allama al-Majlisi and his student, Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri, this implies the principle that the states of the Afterlife should be measured with those of this world. Theological Arguments In order to show that the Heaven is created, scholars have appealed to some verses of the Qur'an : the Qur'an 53 :5 which is a report of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj , the Qur'an 3 :133 and the Qur'an 57 :21 both of which state that the Heaven is \"prepared\", and the Qur'an 9 :100 which says that God has prepared the Heaven, and thus implies that the Heaven and the Hell actually exist right now. In some hadiths from the Imams of Shi'a , it is explicitly stated that the Heaven already exists. Imam al-Rida (a) has appealed to the story of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj to show its existence. Ibn Hazm and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya have also appealed to some accounts of the Prophet's (s) Mi'raj to show that the Heaven is already created. On the contrary, people who believe that the Heaven and the Hell are not created yet have appealed to rational and transmitted evidence. The oldest rational argument is that it is vain to create the Heaven before the resurrection. Some theologians have replied to this argument by saying that the reason for all God's actions need not be known for people, and thus, we cannot hold that the creation of the Heaven before the resurrection is vain from our own perspectives. Esoteric Interpretation of the Corporeal Heaven in the Batini View In accordance with their philosophical methodology, the Batiniyya have provided esoteric interpretations ( ta'wil ) of Qur'anic verses which imply the corporeality, and other features, of the Heaven, taking them to be symbolic. In an explicit objection to them, al-Ghazali maintained that this approach implies that the Prophet (s) was ignorant or, at least, their approach is at odds with the explicit text of the religion and is, thus, against Islam , especially because there are many Qur'anic verses regarding the Heaven and the Afterlife. It has been assumed that the belief in the existence of the Heaven with the features mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths is an essential component of Islam, and thus, the interpretation of Qur'anic verses in a way that leads to the denial of the Heaven's corporeality amounts to the denial of Islam. Muslim theologians do not permit any esoteric interpretation or symbolic construal of religious texts, such as the corporeality of the Heaven in the Qur'an, except when there is a rational dilemma. Sulayman b. Salih al-Ghusn holds that doctrines, such as the corporeality of the Heaven, are rationally plausible and there is a transmitted agreement over them, and thus, it is not permissible to provide an esoteric interpretation of them which leads, say, to the denial of the Heaven's corporeality. The Blessings In the Islamic culture, Divine Satisfaction and His happiness is considered as the highest blessing of the Heaven. Moreover, many various blessings, such as foods, drinks, houses, gardens, palaces, clothes, and the like, have been mentioned in different suras of the Qur'an, such as Qur'an 55 , Qur'an 56 , Qur'an 76 , and some verses of other suras . Divine Satisfaction: According to Islamic hadiths , Divine Satisfaction is the highest blessing of the Heaven. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) to the effect that when people of the Heaven begin to reside in their places, they are told that beyond the blessings they are given is the Divine Satisfaction and His love of them. After this, Imam Ali (a) cited the verse 72 of Qur'an 9 according to which, \"what is greater than all of this is that God is pleased with them\". According to a hadith from the Prophet (s) , the least blessed people in the Heaven are those who are concerned with the bliss of the Heaven, and the most blessed—who are very valuable for God—are those who are concerned with the Divine Presence or Face every morning and evening. Foods and drinks: the Qur'an has emphasized most of all on fruits in the Heaven. According to Qur'anic verses, every type of fruit can always be found in the Heaven in abundance, and they can be easily picked from the trees. The Qur'an has twice pointed to the meat and the flesh of birds as bounties of the Heaven. The Qur'an 47 :15 points to drinks of the Heaven: streams of water, milk, wine, and honey, cups of very pleasant and white wine mixed with the aroma of camphor or ginger from a spring called \" Salsabil \", or mixed with musk. The words, \"sharab\" (drink) and \"sharab tahur\" (pure drink) in the Qur'an also refer to drinks of the Heaven. The Qur'an has emphasized that the wine of the Heaven is free of the problems of the wine of this world (such as intoxication, headache, inclination to sins, and dementia). Clothes: other blessings of the Heaven include silk and dibaj clothes, golden, silver, and pearl bracelets, silk and brocade carpets with gorgeous, tall pillows, golden trays, silver dishes, crystal cups, with young and handsome servants. Marriage: another blessing of the Heaven is the bond of marriage which is referred to in the Qur'an as \"pure spouses\", \"your spouses\", and \"We make them spouses\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have appealed to the Qur'an 13 :23 and Qur'an 40 :8 to show that spouses who are both believers in this world will live together in the Heaven as well. And if parents and children are all righteous, they will be in the Heaven together (the Qur'an 36 :56 and the Qur'an 43 :70). Moreover, the Qur'an has pointed to \"hur\" (once) and \"hur 'in\" (white women with black eyes, three times) and their marriage with people of the Heaven. According to the Qur'an, these women are beautiful and fresh, chaste, and far from any lustful look. Eye-catching things: in the Qur'an 43:71, it is said that everything eye-catching—whatever pleases the eyes—can be found in the Heaven and every desire is satisfied there. Some exegetes have appealed to these phrases to show that the blessings of the Heaven mentioned in the Qur'an do not exhaust all the blessings. The bliss of the Heaven is beyond human minds. Other features of the Heaven: in addition to positive features of the Heaven, the Qur'an has rejected any negative features about it. With respect to its positive features, the Qur'an says that the Heaven is eternal and permanent, secure, stable, continuous, and available. Negative features from which the Heaven is said to be free, include: suffering, frustration, sadness, committing sins , vain talks, attributing lies, hearing any lies, intoxication, and dementia. Degrees In the Islamic culture, it is accepted that the degrees of the Heaven are correlated with human actions, but it is not obvious what degrees are yielded by each action. According to exegetes of the Qur'an, such as al-Fakhr al-Razi , the word, \"darajāt\" (degrees), in the Qur'an with respect to the Heaven, refers to the ranking of the blessings in the Heaven: human beings will enjoy different degrees of the Heaven in accordance to their actions. The Qur'an and hadiths have emphasized different degrees of the Heaven. According to a hadith from the Prophet (s), the Heaven has degrees the distance between each of which is like the distance between the Earth and the sky. Actions and Characters of Heavenly People Many actions are said by the Qur'an and hadiths to lead people to the Heaven. Men and women are said to be equal in this respect. The most frequently mentioned features of heavenly people in the Qur'an include faith , piety , righteous action, obeying God and His messenger, accepting the truth, purity, and avoiding polytheism . The Qur'an also points to characters such as humbleness towards God and people, fear of God, good behavior, avoiding mundane desires, truthfulness, generosity , trustfulness, keeping one's promises, financial aid of the impoverished, avoiding vain talks and actions, and avoiding arrogance . Some people are said to be prohibited from entering the Heaven, such as those who deny divine signs or revelations of God. Some characters and actions that lead to the Heaven include: helping other people, being kind to people, good talk, and avoiding any injustice to others. Some wrong behaviors deprive people of going to the Heaven, such as telling lies, talebearing , ridiculing others, malevolence, contributing to the injustice of the rulers, promiscuity, and drinking wine. The Heaven of Adam (a) and Eve In three Qur'anic suras ( Qur'an 2 :35, Qur'an 7 :19-20, and Qur'an 20 :115, 117 and 120), the first residence of Adam (a) and Eve is said to be the \"Heaven\" (Jannat). According to Qur'anic verses, they enjoyed all the blessings in the Heaven and all of their desires were satisfied, but despite this abundance and welfare, they were warned not to approach a certain tree (and not to eat its fruit). They were also warned about the Devil 's temptations. Adam (a) and his wife disobeyed God, followed the Devil's temptations, and ate the fruit of the forbidden tree . They were thus deported from the Heaven and had to live on the Earth. After this fall (hubut), the life of the human species began on the Earth. There are three views, in Islamic exegetical and theological books, with respect to this Heaven. Al-Fakhr al-Razi has cited all the three views and the arguments for them. Here are the views: (i) it refers to a garden on the Earth, (ii) a heavenly garden other than the promised Heaven, and (iii) the promised Heaven. Al-Fakhr al-Razi holds that all the three views are plausible, though none of them can be proved. Thus, he remained neutral on the issue. Al-Allama al-Majlisi has also pointed to these three views and their arguments. He cited hadiths according to which the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve is the promised Heaven. In other sources, it is identified as a garden on the Earth. Al-Majlisi concluded that we cannot decide on this issue. He also speculated that it might be the heaven of Barzakh Among later exegetes of the Qur'an, Muhammad 'Abduh take the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve to be an Earthly one, taking this to be the view of Sunni scholars. However, Allama Tabataba'i takes the heaven of Adam (a) and Eve to be in the sky, but other than the promised Heaven. He takes it to be located in the world of Barzakh. He also takes the Qur'anic story of the fall from Eden to be a metaphor for the birth of every human person in this world. Books and Writings regarding the Heaven Many independent works have been written about the Heaven and the Hell . Moreover, significant parts of many collections of hadiths are devoted to the citation of hadiths concerning the Heaven and the Hell. Here are some Shiite works in this regard: Ma'alim al-zulfa written by Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani . The section of \"al-'Adl wa l-ma'ad\" (justice and resurrection) in Bihar al-anwar by Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi . Sifat al-janna wa l-nar : a collection of hadiths from Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) regarding the Heaven and the Hell written by Su'ayd b. Janah al-Azdi , a companion of Imam al-Kazim (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) . The book is wholly cited in Ikhtisas and Bihar al-anwar . In addition to Shiite works, some Sunni works are also devoted to the citation of hadiths regarding the Heaven and the Hell, including: Sifat al-janna written by Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani . Shu'ab al-iman written by Ahmad b. Husayn al-Bayhaqi . Al-Targhib wa l-tarhib written by 'Abd al-'Azim b. 'Abd al-Qawiy al-Mundhiri .

{"title": "Paradise", "text": "Paradise or Firdaws (Arabic: فِردوس ) is the highest and the best level of the heaven . This part of the heaven is dedicated to those who possess a high level of faith and good deeds. Based on hadiths , its light is from the light of God and the four rivers of the heaven flow from it. Meaning The meaning of \"firdaws\" is \"garden\" and \"paradise\". In Qur'anic terminology, \"Firdaws\" is considered the highest level of the heaven located at its top, above the divine throne . This word is mentioned twice in the Qur'an . The Prophet (s) advised that when you ask God something, ask Him for Paradise. Description Based on hadiths, the walls of Paradise are made of light and the light of its houses and rooms are from the light of God. In Paradise, there are two palaces, one white and one yellow, one of which belongs to the Prophet (s) and his family and the other belongs to Prophet Abraham (a) and his family. A hadith is transmitted from the Prophet (s) that considered Paradise the best part of the heaven from which the four rivers of the heaven flow. Imam al-Rida (a) too spoke about a palace in this heaven decorated with different jewels, the soil of which is fragrant and it has different kinds of trees and birds with beautiful voices. Residents In verses of the Qur'an and hadiths, different examples of the residents of Paradise are mentioned. In the Qur'an 18 , Paradise is considered to belong to those who have faith and perform good deeds. In the Qur'an 23 , trustworthy people who keep their promises and observe their prayers are considered as the inheritors of Paradise. In hadiths, those who enjoin others to do good and forbid them from evil are also considered among those who go to Paradise. In a hadith, the Prophet (s) and his family and Prophet Abraham (a) and his family are mentioned among the people who are accommodated in Paradise. After the demise of the Prophet (s), lady Fatima (a) considered him a person whose dwelling is Paradise. Some researchers believe that in general, a high level of faith and good deeds can be considered as the criteria for residing in Paradise.

{"title": "Jannat al-Khuld", "text": "Jannat al-Khuld (Arabic: جَنَّةَُ الخُلد ) or everlasting paradise is a quranic term mentioned in Sura al-Furqan . The lexical meaning of \"khuld\" is to stay somewhere without leaving. In Qur'an 25 :15-16 , God has promised everlasting paradise to pious believers and not only the paradise itself is eternal but also its inhabitants. Some exegetes hold that the addition of the term “khuld” (everlasting) to the term “Jannat” (paradise) denotes that this paradise is eternal and will never be destroyed. Jannat al-khuld has appeared in hadith literature as well. If someone desires to have a life and death similar to the life and death of the Prophet (s) and to reside in the eternal paradise which God has promised his messenger, the Prophet (s) has recommended to have the love of Imam Ali (a) and his sons. In another hadith, al-Shaykh al-Saduq quotes the Prophet (s) as saying anyone who fasts eighteen days of the month of Rajab , he or she will reside in eternal paradise along with Prophet Ibrahim (a) .

{"title": "Hell", "text": "Hell or Jahannam (Arabic: جَهنَّم ) is a place in the afterlife in which evil-doers will be punished . The place or parts of it are referred to in the Qur'an also as \" Jaḥīm \" ( الجَحیم ), \"Saqar\" ( السقَر ), \"Sa'īr\" ( السعیر ), and in many cases, it is referred to as \"al-Nar\" ( النار , the Fire). The Hell is not only mentioned in the Qur'an and hadiths ; it is also discussed in Islamic disciplines such as theology , philosophy , and theoretical mysticism . Lexicology The word, \"Jahannam\", literally means a very deep pit. It refers to a fire with which God will punish the sinners in the afterlife . In the terminology of the Qur'an, it refers to the location of afterlife punishments where evil-doers and unbelievers will be punished. Most Muslim lexicographers take \"Jahannam\" to have a non-Arabic root, while some of them take it to have an Arabic origin. Isma'il b. Hammad al-Jawhari and al-Raghib al-Isfahani take it to be a persian word. Al-Raghib takes the original form of \"Jahannam\" to be \"Jahannām\" ( جَهَنّام , a Persian word which means a deep pit). Ibn Athir, Ibn Manzur, and al-Suyuti speculate that the word has a Hebrew origin; they hold that it is derived from the Hebrew word, \"Kihinnām\". Contemporary western researchers take the word to be originated from the Hebrew word, \"Gehennom\" (גיהנום), or \"Jihinum\" which means the valley of Banu Hinum. Hell in Eschatology In eschatology, the Hell is taken to be the worst place as opposed to the Heaven which is taken to be the best place. The Heaven is home to all the good, and the Hell is home to all the sufferings. Agents of the Hell All agents of the Hell are angels and servants who absolutely obey God . In the Islamic doctrine, there is no Hell the control of which is in the hands of devils. The Hell is totally ruled and controlled by God. According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Hell is a torture for the sinners and is a mercy for its agents who work inside it. The main guard of the Hell who is called \"Malik\" ( مالك ) is characterized in hadiths as being very ugly and stinky. The 19 guards of the Hell to which the Qur'an refers are characterized as being so frightening that if an earthly person looked at them, he or she would die immediately. The Philosophy of the Hell The main question concerning the Hell is why evil-doers should endure such a hard and long punishment which is not comparable to hardships of this world with respect to its strength and eternity. Guarantee for religious ruling The fear of the Hell is taken by religious doctrines to be a performance bond for religious rulings. The Qur'an has asked people to fear the Hell and protect themselves and their family from its fire. Punishment for actions Several Qur'anic verses consider the Hell to be a \"punishment\" for one's evil actions. In addition to frequent terms that imply punishment, the term, \"nakal\" ( نَکال , reprisal) is also used, and God has been even characterized as being \"muntaqim\" ( مُنتَقِم , avenger). Embodiment of actions According to the doctrine of the Embodiment of Actions , the punishment endured by evil-doers is, in fact, the real form of their own actions, and it is the actions themselves which take the forms of punishments and bring sufferings to them. No suffering is imposed on anyone from the outside; rather the punishment is the result of their own actions. The notion of the Embodiment of Actions is implied by some Qur'anic verses; however, it is most obviously stated in Sura al-Zilzal (99):8: \"And anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it\" . In another verse of the Qur'an, usurping the possessions of an orphan is identified with eating the fire. From Death to the Resurrection After his death, the sinner endures sufferings in Barzakh (a world between this world and afterlife) until the resurrection . Then a divine court of justice is held on Dooms Day; those who deserve the Heaven will not suffer from the Hell, and evil-doers will be punished after being tried. However, some Islamic texts talk about immediate transfer to the Hell after death; it is as if the fire of the Hell lurks beyond the death. Such a picture is given about the people of the prophets Noah (a) and Lot (a) ; they were immediately moved to the Hell after they died by a divine punishment in this world. The Hell is said not to wait for evil-doers to go to it; rather it lurks in ambush for them. When evil-doers are about to enter the Hell, its fire flames. And when the divine court of justice is held after the resurrection, the Hell is brought to the scene. On Dooms Day, the Hell is presented to the evil-doers. They will see the Hell and know that they will be thrown into it, feeling the suffering before entering it. The sufferings of the Hell are referred to in the Qur'an as \"'Adhab yawm 'azim\" (the punishment of a tremendous day), \"'Adhab yawm 'aqim\" (the punishment of an inauspicious day), and \"'Adhab yawm kabir\" (the punishment of a great day) as attributed to the day of resurrection. The Hell acts like a hunter: some of its flames go out to capture certain groups of sinners and devour them. The flame is characterized as having two eyes and a fluently talking tongue. Such flames are commissioned to hunt three groups of sinners: obstinate tyrants, those who bothered God and His prophet, and those who make idols. Sometimes the picture is given with more details: there are flames that capture the murderers of Imam al-Husayn (a) , just like a bird that picks seeds from the ground, and take them inside the fire. The Hell is greedy to devour the sinners, and however many evil-doers are thrown inside it, it asks more by saying \"are there any more?\". The Hell lurks in ambush for every person. There is no person present at the day of the resurrection who does not enter it. However, one can find his or her way out of it provided that they have attained salvation. Some hadiths have elaborated this doctrine by talking about a hazardous bridge that goes through the Hell; those who have attained salvation will successfully cross the bridge, and the sinners will fall from it into the Hell. The bridge is characterized as being as narrow as the edge of a sword. Inspired by some Qur'anic verses, the bridge is sometimes called the Sirat . Groups of People Who Enter the Hell In some general statements in religious texts, it is said that many people from human beings and jinn will be punished in the Hell, but in other texts, the instances of people who are punished in the hell are specified with more detail. Polytheism and unbelief : the prime instance of people who are punished in the Hell are polytheists, [40] because polytheism is the biggest sin. [41] Those who take a creature as their god will burn in the fire of the Hell together with what they worshiped. [42] Some rare hadiths have even talked about the sun and the moon being thrown into the Hell, because they were worshiped by some people. [43] Sometimes it is said that unbelievers will be thrown into the Hell, and sometimes obstinate unbelievers are said to enter the Hell. [44] The notion of obstinacy is sometimes cashed out in terms of falsifying the signs of God [45] and ridiculing the divine signs. [46] Arrogance : arrogance is a sin with which many people of the Hell are characterized. [47] In some hadiths, the aspects of such arrogance are delineated. [48] For example, there is a hadith according to which most people in the Hell are arrogant people and tyrants. [49] Brutal rulers: it frequently appears in many hadiths that the first people who enter the Hell are brutal rulers. The theme appears in different Shiite [50] and Sunni [51] sources of hadiths. There is a hadith from Imam Ali (a) according to which a brutal leader is in the bottom of the Hell and will be punished in the most severe way. [52] Assistants of brutal rulers: people who lean towards brutal rulers [53] and guide them through their brutal acts [54] will be thrown in the Hell along with their bosses. [55] Other descriptions of the people of the Hell refer to the above notion: \"taghi\" ( , disobedient), \"mutrif\" ( , indulged in luxury), and \"musrif\" ( , extravagant). Sinners : one feature of the people of the Hell is that they are sinners and evil-doers, that is, they disobey God and His prophet. [59] The most important sin because of which people go to the Hell is the violation of the rights of people , such as killers of innocent people, [60] faultfinding people, gossipers, [61] and stingy collectors of wealth. [62] In hadiths, other groups of sinners are mentioned over and above the ones mentioned in the Qur'an. [63] The lusts and appetites lead one to the neglect of the horrors of the Hell. [64] Companionship with Sinners: According to some hadiths, people who have committed similar sins will be one another's companions in the Hell. That is, in addition to individual punishments, there is collective punishment as well. The Qur'an frequently talks about nations [65] or groups [66] entering the fire or about people being gathered to the Hell. [67] Although such groups are companions, the Qur'an has mentioned that they talk to each other in a hostile way and express their hate to one another. [68] Dwelling Forever In the initial picture given of the Hell, its dwellers can never go out of it and will be punished there forever. What reinforces this initial picture is that there is no death in the afterlife; dwellers of the Hell will never die, although all conditions that lead to death in this world are present. They do not die, and they never go out of fire. There is a hadith according to which the death is brought to the scene on Dooms Day in the form of a goat—in a way that everyone will recognize it as death—and it is slaughtered, so that people are disappointed from getting rid of their sufferings by death. There are many Qur'anic verses concerning the eternal punishment in the Hell for evil-doers. The Hell is sometimes referred to as \"Dar al-Khuld\" ( دارالخلد , House of Eternity) and \"'Adhab al-Khuld\" ( عذاب الخلد , Eternal Punishment). According to some People of the Book , those who enter the Hell will only be punished there for a few days and they will then be saved from the fire. However, their belief is strongly reproached in the Qur'an . However, there are few remarks in the Qur'an that led some Muslims to the belief that there are temporary punishments in the Hell as well. Sura al-An'am (6):128 talks about some people dwelling in the Hell forever, but it then qualifies it with the phrase: \"except what God wills\". Thus, some exegetes of the Qur'an maintained that some dwellers of the Hell might find a way out of it one day. There is also a Qur'anic verse according to which sinners \"will dwell therein for ages (ahqab, أحقاب)\" (78:23). This verse has also led some exegetes to believe that the Hell will be a temporary place, at least, for some of its dwellers. According to a hadith , \"I swear to God no one will be saved from the Fire unless they stay there for \"ahqab\" ( أحقاب , ages), each \"haqb\" ( حقب , age) being over 80 years. And if the dwellers of the Hell are told that they would stay there for as many years as all the sands in the world, they would still be delighted\". Dwellers of the Hell who will be saved from the fire after enduring some suffering for their evil actions are considered by some hadiths to be Muslim sinners. According to some hadiths, whoever has a little bit of belief or faith in their heart will be saved from the fire one day. And sometimes people are saved from the Hell by the intercession of some saints of God, while they have turned into ashes in the Hell. Features of the Hell Types of Punishment mentioned in the Qur'an Fire: the most important punishment with which the Hell is known is a burning fire. Some verses of the Qur'an talk about evil-doers falling into the fire, instead of falling into the Hell. However, the Qur'an highlights the peculiarity of this fire by characterizing it as \"burning fire\" or \"lidded fire\" that cooks the skin and leaves nothing. The fire is known as \"Nar Allah\" (the fire of God) and has flaming pillars, and unlike earthly fires, it starts from hearts and it flames outwards, rather than inwards. Its firewood are the human beings themselves. According to some Qur'anic verses, there is a fire that has human beings and stones as its firewood. Fire-related punishments: some punishments in the Hell are related to fire; for instance, \"samum\" ( سموم ) which is fierce blast of fire, and \"hamim\" ( حمیم ) which is boiling water which dwellers of the Hell have to drink, and it will be poured on their heads. Their clothes are also from fire or burning materials such as \"qatiran\" ( قطران , melted tar) and \"hamim\" . Food and drink: the Qur'an and hadiths have mentioned some of what the dwellers of the Hell will eat and drink. Unlike foods and drinks in the Heaven which are characterized with what is familiar to earthly ones, those in the Hell are characterized with unfamiliar terms, such as \"Zaqqum\" ( زقّوم ) which is a kind of tree, \"ghislin\" ( غسلین ) which is taken by the exegetes of the Qur'an to be filth, pus, and corruption from the washing of the wounds, \"dari'\" ( ضریع ) which is thorns or thorny fruit, and drinks such as \"ghassaq\" ( غساق ) which is paralyzing cold water, \"sadid\" ( صدید ) which is fetid or festering water, and \"shurb al-him\" ( شرب الهیم ), which is drinking like a thirsty camel. These terms have been difficult for the exegetes to explain. However, their general feature is that they do not quench thirst or feed up the person, they are stuck in one's throat, and tear up the viscera. Other punishments: there are other punishments in the Hell, such as chains and shackles , iron mace, whips, horrifying sounds in the Hell, tightness of the space, the feeling of pressure, and shadows which are fiercer than the fire. And many more punishments. Types of Punishment Mentioned in the Hadith There are more details in hadiths: for example, there is said to be prisons in the Hell with peculiar punishments, and they are called the prison of Bulas ( بولس ) or Falaq ( فلق ). There are descriptions of snakes and scorpions in the Hell which have been questionable for critics. Some snakes are introduced with their names. Of drinks in the Hell, \"tinat al-khiyal\" (essence of corruption) is mentioned, which is extracted from dwellers of the Hell themselves. There are hadiths about the feeling of disgust by eating and drinking in the Hell. Also, a mill is mentioned which grinds religious scholars who did not practice what they knew. \"Zamharir\", which is a Qur'anic word regarding the Heaven, has been used in hadiths in a different meaning, referring to a land in the Hell with a horrible, freezing cold which tears the bodies of the evil-doers into pieces. According to a hadith, people of the Hell take refuge to Zamharir in order to escape the fire, but they suffer even more in there, and so they beg God to return them to the fire. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an, the Qur'anic verse according to which dwellers of the Hell will stay there forever \"except what God wills\" refers to them going to Zamharir for a while during their punishments. Gates and Floors of the Hell The Qur'an frequently points out that the Hell has gates. In one case, it says that the Hell has 7 gates each of which has an \"assigned portion\", that is, they are assigned to different classes of sinners. Some verses also refer to floors and stages of the Hell, for example \"the lowest stage (al-darak al-asfal) of the fire\". Some exegetes of the Qur'an have taken \"al-darak al-asfal\" to refer to the lowest stage or floor of the Hell. Some lexicographers and exegetes point out that \"darakat\" with respect to the Hell are counterparts of \"darajat\" (degrees) with respect to the Heaven. However, the word, \"darajat\", has been used about the Hell as well. Some exegetes, such as ibn Jurayh, take the 7 gates to refer to the 7 stages (darakat) of the Hell. This is confirmed in a hadith as well. Some exegetes take the different names for the fires of the Hell to refer to these 7 stages or floors: \"Jahannam\", \"Laza\" ( لظی , flames of the fire), \"Hutama\" ( حطمة , that which crushes and breaks into pieces), \"Sa'ir\" ( سعیر , blazing fire), \"Saqar\" ( سقر , scorching fire), \"Jahim\" ( جحیم , hell fire), and \"Hawiya\" ( هاویة , bottomless pit). However, there is no agreement over their order. There are hadiths that characterize these stages individually; for example, \"Saqar\" is where arrogant people will dwell, and \"Sa'ir\" is where killers will be punished. Other Places of Hell In addition to \"darakat\" (or stages) of the Hell, there are some Qur'anic terms occurring in verses related to the Hell which are taken in some hadiths to refer to specific locations in the Hell. For example, the word, \"Sa'ud\" ( صعود , hard ascent or mount of calamities) in the Qur'an, Sura al-Muddaththir (74):17, is taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, the word, \"'Aqaba\" ( عقبة , height or ascent) is also taken to be the name of a mountain in the Hell, \"Hufra min al-nar\" (a pit of fire) as a pit in the Hell, \"Falaq\" as a pit in the Hell in which people are punished in different ways, \"Wayl\" as a horrifying valley or a pit in the Hell which it takes 40 years for one to reach its bottom, \"Ghayy\" ( غیّ ) as a valley in the Hell, \"Ghassaq\" ( غساق ) as a river or a valley full of scorpions, \"Atham\" ( اثام ) as a valley in the Hell, and \"Mawbiq\" ( موبق ) as a river of pus and blood in the Hell. There are other locations in the Hell mentioned in hadiths, such as the Pit of Sadness (Huzn, حزن ) from which the Hell itself escapes, the Pit of Habhab ( هبهب ) located in the valley of Saqar in which tyrants dwell, the Sakran ( سکران ) mountain and its valley, Ghadban ( غضبان ), in which there are coffins of fire, and a coffin of fire in the bottom of the Hell in which 6 people from the ancient time and 6 people from the Umma of Prophet Muhammad (s) are punished. Some Imami and Sunni scholars of hadiths have written independent books regarding the Hell and the Heaven, such as Sifat al-janna wa l-nar (Features of the Heaven and the Hell) by Sa'id b. Jinah which is the oldest book in this regard available to us. Humiliation and Deprivation According to Qur'anic doctrines, just as neglectful indulgence in mundane pleasures is punished by deprivation in the Hell, arrogance and tyranny in this world is punished by humiliation in there. From the very beginning, the way evil-doers are thrown into the fire is accompanied by humiliation, as implied by phrases such as \"falling into the fire\" , \"outcast into the fire\", \"being grabbed by the head or by the feet\" and the like. And when they are being punished, they are humiliated by different sufferings; for example, \"'Adhab al-hun\" ( عذاب الهون , humiliating punishment) is a punishment mentioned in the Qur'an for arrogance and tyranny. One manifestation of such humiliation is seen in evil-doers being reproached by the guards of the Hell as well as in a conversation between the dwellers of the Hell and the dwellers of the Heaven , as appearing in the Qur'an. The most significant deprivation of the dwellers of the Hell is that God never talks to them, which makes them forlorn in the Hell. There are Qur'anic verses in this regard according to which dwellers of the Hell ask the guards to pray for them to God, and when the guards disappoint them, they pray to God on their own. The Qur'an says that their requests, cries, wishes of ransoms for release, and wishes of another opportunity to return to this world and compensate their actions are not heard by God. It is repeatedly emphasized that dwellers of the Hell receive no help, have no new opportunity, and are not given any safety conduct . According to a sermon attributed to Imam Ali (a) regarding the features of the Hell: \"it is a house where no mercy can be found and no praying by its dwellers is heard\". There are some hadiths, however, to the effect that in some exceptional cases their praying is heard by God: for example, the one according to which there is a servant of God in the Hell who kept calling God as \"Ya Hannan, Ya Mannan\" (O the Charitable, O the Benefactor) for a thousand years. Finally, God sends Jabra'il to him to answer his calls and forgives him. In Islamic Theology The issue of rewards and punishments in the afterlife, and in particular, the issue of the Hell, constitute a large portion of theological works. There are some common theological issues regarding the Hell or Heaven, as there are specific issues about either of the two. Whether the Hell and the Heaven exist now: one theological question is whether the Hell and Heaven are already created or not. The question seems to be posed by Hisham al-Futi for the first time; he asked the question because he thought there was no point for the Hell or the Heaven to exist before the resurrection . Some scholars of the Mu'tazila , Najjariyya , and scholars associated with the Mu'tazila, such as Zaydiyya and Khawarij took al-Futi's question seriously and maintained that the Hell and the Heaven might not already be created; it is, indeed, possible for them to exist or not exist now. Some people, such as Abu Hashim al-Juba'i agreed with al-Futi, and some of the Mu'tazila, such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i and Abu l-Hasan al-Basri as well as Imami and Ash'ari theologians maintained that the Hell and the Heaven already exist. Eternity and immortality: another common question about the Hell and the Heaven is that of their eternity and immortality. The question was posed by Juham b. Safwan on the ground that it is not possible for a contingent entity to be infinite. Jahiz allegedly believed that there is no eternal dwelling in the Hell and that the dwellers of the Hell will eventually turn into fire. However, proponents of the eternity of the Hell and the Heaven tried to reply to objections by appeal to philosophical and theological reasoning as well as rhetorical arguments . Wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell: along with the theological issue of infallibility in the Heaven and the voluntary or involuntary abstinence from wrong-doing in there, there is a theological issue about wrong-doings by the dwellers of the Hell. One important theory in this respect is the theory of ilja', according to which God forces the dwellers of the Hell to quit wrong-doings, and so their abstinence is not praiseworthy. However, others believe that their abstinence from wrong-doings is because of their lack of motivations for such actions. They believe that only wrong-doing without any obstinacy towards God is possible in the afterlife. Committers of major sins in the Hell: this is a ramification of the old question about people who commit major sins. Khawarij take committers of major sins to be unbelievers if they do not repent to God, and so for them, there is no significant difference between the position of an unbeliever and a committer of a major sin who did not repent to God. Of Khawarij, Najda b. 'Amir who was more modest believed that it is possible for such evil-doers to suffer a punishment in accordance with their sins outside the Hell and then enter the Heaven. In his view, the Hell is only home to unbelievers and so a Muslim evil-doer does not enter the Hell. His view was later revised by some of the Murji'a. Muqatil b. Sulayman believed that Muslim committers of major sins suffer the Hell from a distance on the Sirat bridge and will suffer in accordance with their sins, and will then go to the Heaven without entering the Hell. The view of the Mu'tazila about the punishment of Muslim wrong-doers is grounded in their position concerning Manzila bayn al-Manzilatayn (a position between the two positions). Most of the Mu'tazila believed that in the afterlife, all people are only divided into two groups: people of the Heaven and people of the Hell, and so for them, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell just like the unbelievers, except that their punishment will be milder than that of the unbelievers. According to Imami and Ash'ari theologians, Muslim wrong-doers will enter the Hell if they are not forgiven by God and will be punished in accordance with their sins and will then go to the Heaven until no monotheist remains in the Hell. They take \"khulud\" in the Qur'an to mean a long, rather than an eternal, stay in the Hell. Some of the Mu'tazila have the same view, adding that it does not fit the divine justice for monotheist wrong-doers to stay in the Hell forever. Some Imami theologians deny that such wrong-doers will go to the Heaven, although they do believe that they will finally go out of the Hell. He identified such an intermediate position between the Hell and the Heaven with what is called \" A'raf \" or \" Barzakh \" in the Qur'an. The goodness of the Hell: one theological question about the Hell is whether eternal punishment in the Hell is good. The question is taken seriously by later Mu'tazili theologians. In the school of Basra , scholars such as Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i believed that punishment in the Hell is neither good, nor bad, and it is a matter of convention to call it good or bad. But in the school of Baghdad , people such as Abu Ja'far al-Iskafi believed that punishment in the Hell is good and is a divine mercy even for unbelievers who suffer them. In Islamic Sufism and Mysticism Muslim mystics, just like the people of sharia, take the Hell to be a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the Hell. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the sharia as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers. Early Sufis emphasized the fear of God, detachment from this world, thinking about death, and the punishment of sinners. They exhibited fear of the consequences of committing sins, and remorse and shame as well as buka' (crying) because of their sins. In this ascetic Sufism, fear is preferred to hope due to its stronger impact on one's will, ascetic life, and the awakening of the soul. Such themes became more interior in the views of Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya. She emphasized the fear of divine punishment and believed that such a fear should be a believer's guide. She replaced the fear of eternal punishment or hope of eternal reward by the eternal love of God and His servitude. In fact, a Sufi's ideal is love of, and unification with, God. Thus, sins make one separated from God and the Hell is, indeed, the separation from God, which is the biggest deprivation. They even believe that if the blessings of the Heaven are to prevent one from seeing the divine beauty, a lover of God had better go to the Hell and see His beauty. In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God. The highest desideratum for them was divine love and satisfaction. Dhu l-Nun al-Misri believed that fear of the Hell was nothing compared to the fear of separation from God. Sufis emphasized that the fire of the Hell has nothing to do with real believers and lovers of God. In the remarks of Sufis, there are expressions such as the Hell of separation, the suffering of distance from the Beloved, the Hell of distance, and the humility of distance which are used in contrast to the suffering or fire of the Hell. They imply that the real suffering is that of distance from God, which is taken by Sufis to be a painful punishment. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are only psychological states of the soul after its separation from the body. A soul is prosperous or miserable to the degree to which they know God. The humiliating punishment of the soul can cease by the removal of the distance, that is, by the removal of one's ignorance of God.

{"title": "Hawiya", "text": "Al-Hāwīya (Arabic: الهاوية ) or the Abyss is one of the names of the hell mentioned in the Qur'an . According to a hadith , hawiya is the lowest level of the hell and according to another hadith, it is the place for those who deny wilaya of Imam Ali (a) . Meaning \"Hawiya\" literally means \"to fall\" and the hell is called so, because disbelievers and criminals fall into it. In the Qur'an Hawiya is once mentioned in Qur'an 101 :8–11, \"But as for him whose deeds weigh light in the scales, * his home will be the Abyss. * And what will show you what it is? * It is a scorching fire!\". A group of exegetes have interpreted the word \"umm\" as \"place\" [\"home\"] and the same way a mother embraces her child, the hell embraces people. However, another group of exegetes have interpreted \"umm\" as \"brain\" and have stated that \"hawiya\" refers to the way people fall in it by their heads. In Hadiths In a hadith from Imam Ali (a) , he (a) mentions \"hawiya\" the first level from the seven levels of the hell. Also, in some hadiths, \"hawiya\" refers to the seventh and the lowest level of the hell. According to a hadith, Prophet Jesus (a) passed by a town and saw that all its people were dead and their bodies were left on the ground. He (a) resurrected one of the dead upon the request of one of his Hawariyyun (apostles of Jesus) and asked him, \"what happened to you?\" He said, \"we enjoyed the night in happiness, but in the morning we were sent to hawiya of the hell.\" Prophet Jesus (a) asked him, \"what is hawiya?\" He answered, \"It is sijjin.\" Prophet Jesus (a) asked him, \"what is sijjin?\" He answered, \"Mountains of rocks which turn to the fire blazing toward us.\" Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (a) said, \"One who denies wilaya of Imam Ali (a), his abode is hawiya.\" See Also Hell Jahim Asfal al-Safilin Notes References Names Levels Punishments Residents Related Death Related"}
{"title": "Jahim", "text": "Jaḥīm (Arabic: جَحِيم ) is one of the names of the Hell , which means intense fire. In the Qur'an , \"jahim\" has been used to refer to the Hell, and in one case, it is used to mean intense fire. In some hadiths , Jahim is said to be a level of the Hell. According to Qur'anic verses , inhabitants of Jahim include unbelievers , polytheists , and unjust people. Meaning \"Jahim\" literally means intense fire and heat . It also refers to a place in which there is intense fire . Thus, \"Jahim\" has been used to refer to the Hell. In Qur'anic uses, it usually means the Hell . The Hell \"Jahim\" is said to be one of the names of the Hell . In some Qur'anic verses, \"Jahim\" has been used in contrast to the Heaven . The word has been used twenty seven times in the Qur'an, in twenty six cases of which it refers to the Hell . It is used for another meaning only in one case , where it refers to the fire that had been prepared by Nimrod to set Ibrahim (a) on fire. There is a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) in which he counts Jahim as a level of the Hell . Ibn Abbas was quoted as saying that Jahim is the fire of the Hell . Inhabitants of Jahim According to Qur'anic verses, different groups of people are inhabitants of Jahim, including unbelievers and deniers of divine signs, polytheists, unjust people, the wicked, and transgressors.

{"title": "Dajjal", "text": "Dajjāl (Arabic: دَجَّال ) is a person or being which in some narrations has been considered among the greatest enemies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It is mentioned in narrations that Dajjal appears at the time of hardship and famine. He will deceive and attract a group to himself, but finally will be destroyed by Imam (a). According to Shiite hadiths , Dajjal's riot is a sign of the Reappearance of the Twelfth Shiite Imam. Lexical Meaning \"Dajjal\" comes from the root form \"Dal Jim Lam\" (Arabic: دال جیم لام ) meaning \"very deceiving\". The word \"Dajjal\" in Hebrew teachings means \"enemy of God\" constituting from \"Dajj\" meaning \"enemy\" and \"al\" meaning \"God\". (In Hebrew, \"al\" and \"il\" mean God, e.g. Israel means friend of God, or as Jewish interpret triumphant with God, who prevails with God!). In Muslim Sources In Sunni Sources Most of the narrations regarding Dajjal have been narrated by Ahmad b. Hanbal in Musnad , al-Tirmidhi in his Jami' , Ibn Majah in his Sunan , Muslim in his Sahih , and by Ibn Athir in al-Nihaya from Abd Allah b. Umar and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Jabir b. Abd Allah al-Ansari . In Sunni hadiths, the riot of Dajjal is taken as a sign of the Day of Judgment . In Shia Sources In Shiite books of hadiths, there are only few hadiths to the effect that the riot of Dajjal is a sign of the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) along with the Heavenly Cry , the riot of Sufyani , and the riot of Yamani . These hadiths are not regarded as reliable . There are mentions that he will be killed by Imam (a) or in another narration by Jesus Christ (a) . In these narrations, there is no mention of the issues suggested in Sunni narrations such as Dajjal's mischiefs, his appearance, his followers, etc. According to a narration by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq from the Prophet (s) , mention of Dajjal has been in the past but his presence will be in future. According to hadiths, Dajjal appears at a time of hardship and starvation, deceives a group of people, and gathers them around himself. If we assume the story of Dajjal as true, undoubtedly many of the characteristics mentioned for him would seem legendary. Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi narrated a hadith from the Prophet (s) through Sunni sources saying, \"No prophet was ever assigned to mission unless he alarmed his people about the mischief of Dajjal.\" According to the lexical meaning of Dajjal, it seems that it would not refer to a certain person, but anyone having invalid claims trying to deceive people might be Dajjal. In this regard, existence of several Dajjals can be justified who may have emerged in different periods and have tried to make mischief and deceive people having weak faith . Existence of hadiths in which several Dajjals are mentioned supports this assumption including a hadith from the Prophet (s), \"Before coming of the Dajjal, more than seventy Dajjals will come.\" Therefore, the issue of Dajjal suggests that on the verge of the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , a deceiving person would do all he can to keep the culture and system of ignorance in order to make people doubtful about the truth and accomplishment of Imam's (a) uprising and his leadership. About Dajjal, many unfounded assumptions have been proposed, none of which have any clear and definite reference and they are only based on possibilities. In the New Testament In Hebrew and in Jewish doctrines, the word, \"Dajjal\", means the enemy of God, composed of the word, \"dajj\" (enemy) and \"al\" (God). In the New Testament , it only exists in the letters of John, the Apostle, and those who deny the Christ, the Father, or the Son are called Dajjal. In English translation of holy books of Christianity , \"Anti-Christ\" has been considered as the equivalent for it which is the Greek corresponding word; as we read in the first letter of John, \"Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.\" Also, in this chapter, verses 22 and 23 we read, \"Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist--denying the Father and the Son.\" . Time of Emergence According to some non-certain hadiths, Dajjal begins his riot in Isfahan or Khorasan . It is mentioned in a hadith that when the spoils of the war in Constantinople are being shared, the news of the emergence of Dajjal is given to Imam al-Mahdi (a) and his companions.\" On the verge of the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a), many signs appear one of which is the coming of Dajjal. Characteristics, Beliefs and Thoughts In hadiths (the origin for most of them are Sunni sources), it is mentioned that Dajjal claims to be God and by his existence, a great bloodshed and mischief happens in the world. It can be learned from the reports that his right eye is sealed and his left eye is in the middle of his forehead and illuminates and that there is a blood clot is in his eye. He is large, powerful, weird looking and very skillful in magic. There is a black mountain in front of him which seems to people that it is a mountain of bread and there is a white mountain behind him which seems to people as flowing pure water. He shouts, \"My servants! I am your great Lord.\" Dajjal passes everywhere but he does not go to Mecca , Medina , and Jerusalem al-Quds . Most of his followers are adulterine Jews and Bedouin Arabs who have crowns on their heads. It is mentioned in these reports that about Dajjal, the Prophet (s) said, \"Every believer who sees Dajjal, will spit on his face and recites the Sura al-Fatiha (Qur'an 1) to dispel that cursed one's magic.\" According to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , in a lengthy speech, Imam Ali (a) said, \"Imam al-Mahdi (a) will go from Mecca to Jerusalem al-Quds with his companions and there war happened between Imam (a) and Dajjal and his army; and Dajjal and his army will be defeated so that the first to the last of them will be killed and then the world will thrive.\" Eventually, According to hadiths, Dajjal will be hung and executed by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in Kufa or a place beside the gate of Lad near Jerusalem al-Quds. On another hadith, Dajjal will be killed in Syria .

{"title": "Hadith al-Wasiyya", "text": "Hadith al-Wasiyya Subject Twelve Mahdis Issued by Prophet Muhammad (s) Validity of the chain of transmission Weak Shi'a sources Kitab al-Ghayba (al-Tusi) Ḥadīth al-Waṣiyya (Arabic: حَدیث الوَصیَّت ) lit. Hadith of succession is a hadith about twelve Mahdis , who succeed Imam al-Mahdi (a) . The hadith is cited in the book al-Ghayba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi . Ahmad al-Hassan, the leader of Ansar al-Mahdi, calls himself a mediated child of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the first of the twelve succeeding Mahdis by an appeal to this hadith. Shiite scholars reject Ahmad al-Hassan’s interpretation of the hadith, maintaining that it is incompatible with the widely accepted and authentic Shiite hadiths. Some researchers have studied the chain of transmission and content of the hadith and found it flawed. For instance, the chain of its transmission is said to be weak. Moreover, it is in contradiction with many hadiths in which the Prophet’s successors are restricted to the Twelve Imams . Introduction and Content of the Hadith Hadith al-Wasiyya is a hadith cited by al-Shaykh al-Tusi in his book al-Ghayba as quoted from the Prophet (s) . In Hadith al-Wasiyya, the Prophet (s) tells Imam 'Ali (a) that there will be Twelve Imams after him and then lists the names of the Twelve Shiite Imams. After this, the Prophet (s) says twelve Mahdis will succeed the Twelfth Imam (a) after his demise. Here is the final part of the hadith: “After them [the Twelve Imams], there will be twelve Mahdis. When the Twelfth Imam passes away, he will be succeeded by his son, who is the first close person. He has three names: one is my name, the other is my father’s name; that is, 'Abd Allah and Ahmad, and his third name is Mahdi, and he is the first believer.” The hadith is the main evidence used by Ahmad al-Hassan, the leader of Ansar al-Mahdi, to prove the existence of twelve Mahdis after the twelve Imams. By making recourse to this hadith, he claims that he is the first Mahdi and Imam al-Mahdi’s son. Shiite scholars believe that the chain of transmission of this hadith is not reliable. Moreover, they reject Ahmad al-Hassan’s interpretation of the hadith. Ahmad al-Hassan’s Recourses to the Hadith By making an appeal to Hadith al-Wasiyya, Ahmad al-Hassan says that there will be twelve Mahdis after Imam al-Mahdi (a), claiming that he is the first of those Mahdis. In addition, he cites the term “his son” (ibnih) in the hadith to argue that he is a mediated son of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Accordingly, he claims that he will play a role before Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance , during his government, and afterwards. Views of Shiite Scholars Shiite scholars believe that Hadith al-Wasiyya is incompatible with well-known authentic hadiths. They include al-Tabrisi (a fifth/eleventh-century Quranic exegete), al-Irbili (a seventh/thirteenth-century scholar of hadith), al-'Allama al-Majlisi , and al-Hurr al-'Amili (an eleventh/seventeenth-century scholar of hadith). Moreover, al-Tabrisi and al-Irbili believe that this hadith is incompatible with authentic hadiths to the effect that there will be no other government after Imam al-Mahdi’s. Problems with Hadith al-Wasiyya Other objections have also been raised to any recourse to Hadith al-Wasiyya: This is khabar al-wahid (hadith transmitted by one person), which just yields probabilistic knowledge, and thus, it cannot be deployed to established beliefs. [12] According to this hadith, the Prophet’s successors will be 24, which is at odds with the well-established restriction of his successors to 12. [13] It contradicts the hadiths according to which Imam al-Mahdi (a) is the final successor (khatam al-awsiya'). Moreover, it is incompatible with several hadiths about raj'a (return). [14] The chain of transmission of this hadith is weak: its transmitters are unreliable or unknown. So, it cannot pose a challenge for authentic hadiths .

{"title": "Letters of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Letters of Imam al-Mahdī (a) or Tawqīʿāt al-Imām al-Mahdī (a) are letters and correspondences of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It sometimes refers to his non-written words as well. There are eighty \"tawqi'at\" (letters) by Imam al-Mahdi (a). They are mostly issued during the Minor Occultation and are about different issues such as the principles of Shiite beliefs , Islamic jurisprudence , financial matters, and the like. The notion of tawqi' Tawqi'at (plural of Tawqi'; meaning: letters) of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is a Shiite term referring to Imam al-Mahdi's (a) written words. It has also been used to refer to his non-written hadiths ; for example, al-Shaykh al-Saduq cited some of his hadiths in the section of tawqi'at. Moreover, some remarks by Imam al-Mahdi's (a) Four Deputies , such as information about the future and religious matters, are also considered as tawqi'at. The latter use is based on Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti 's remark that in matters religious he never speaks out of his own thoughts; rather he cites what he heard from the origin (that is, Imam al-Mahdi (a)). Number of tawqi'at Imam al-Mahdi's (a) tawqi'at are cited in the books, Kamal al-din by al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Ghiba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi. In the former, forty nine tawqi'at and a supplication are cited, some of which are short and some are long. The latter contains forty three tawq'iat and hadiths, considering some of these as Imam al-Mahdi's (a) miracles . Some of them are cited along with a description of their occasions, and some are manuscripts of the Imam (a) himself issued as public statements, including the principles of Shiism . Of these forty three tawqi's, twelve are cited from al-Shaykh al-Saduq and some of them can be found in Kamal al-din as well. Thus by omitting repeated tawqi's, the two books contain eighty tawqi's. Handwritings of tawqi'at In many hadiths, it is made explicit that correspondences by Imams (a) were in their own handwriting. Particularly, it is sometimes emphasized about Imam al-Mahdi's (a) tawqi'at that his own stamp was in the letters, and he sometimes made it explicit at the bottom of the letters that they were written by his own hands. How were the letters received and delivered? During the Minor Occultation , the main people who received Imam al-Mahdi's (a) letters and delivered letters of the Shiites to him were the special deputies of the Imam (a) . In some cases, however, letters or requests were delivered to Imam al-Mahdi (a) by some servants or visitors who went to Imam's (a) house. For example, Muhammad b. Yusuf al-Shashi sent a letter to the Imam (a) by a woman who visited Imam's (a) house, and received Imam's (a) reply from her. Sometimes the letters (tawqi'at) were public, and so they were duplicated by different people. The letters of the Imam (a) were sent by special messengers. Due to security issues, the identity of these messengers remained unknown, and they were mentioned as \"a woman\", \"a boy\", \"a black boy\", \"a messenger from Husayn b. Ruh\", and the like. The date of issuance Most of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) letters were issued during the Minor Occultation ( 260 /874 - 329 /941) as answers to questions delivered to Shiites by the Four Deputies . During the Major Occultation, only two letters have been addressed to al-Shaykh al-Mufid late in his life, but there are reservations about the attribution of these letters to Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Topics of tawqi'at On disputes over Imam Hasan al-'Askari's successor When God took him ( Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) ) to Himself, you thought God has vitiated His religion by cutting the medium (the Imam) between Him and the people. But this never happened and will never happen until the Dooms Day when God reveals His will. The previous Imam (a) passed away while he was happy and compliant with the practice of his ancestors. His will and knowledge and successor are among us, and no one will dispute us about his place with us. ( al-Shaykh al-Tusi , al-Ghayba , p. 286). Islamic Doctrines Some letters sent by Imam al-Mahdi (a) were answers to questions regarding Islamic doctrines, such as divine attributes , prophethood , and imamate . In an answer to questions about imamate, Imam al-Mahdi (a) emphasized that the Earth will never be without a hujja (Imam), and this divine tradition will last until the Dooms Day . He said that each Imam has the obligation to introduce the next Imam, and that Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) introduced him as his successor. He defended the institution of imamate in general and his own imamate against people like Ja'far al-Kadhdhab . He also asked Shiites not to predict a date for his reappearance, or search for his place. And he appointed trusted deputies for himself. Jurisprudential rules A vast and considerable part of the tawqi'at are answers to questions regarding the jurisprudential rulings, such as questions regarding cleanliness (tahara), prayer , fasting , hajj , testimony , judgeship, Endowment (waqf), transactions, khums , sadaqa (alms), marriage , intoxicants , visiting the shrines of Shiite Imams (a) , and the like. Financial matters: Some letters are concerned with money and property that Shiites sent to the Imam (a) as khums or other Islamic financial obligations by his deputies or agents. For example, Muhammad b. Shadhan b. Nu'aym al-Nisaburi says: \"I had 500 dirhams minus 20 dirhams. I wanted it to reach 500. So I added 20 dirhams from my own money to it, and I gave it to Asadi, but I did not mention the money that I had added to it. In his reply to me, Imam al-Mahdi (a) wrote, 'I have received 500 dirhams, 20 of which was from your own money'\". Imam al-Mahdi's last letter to the Fourth Deputy You will pass away within six days. So prepare yourself and do not leave your position (deputy of the Imam) to anyone else, since the second Occultation has started and I will not reappear except by God's permission. The reappearance will occur after a very long time when people's hearts become inexorable and the Earth is rife with cruelty and brutality. Soon some of my, Shiites will claim they have met me. Be aware that anyone who claims to meet me before the rise of Sufyani and the Heavenly Cry is a liar. ( al-Shaykh al-Saduq , Kamal al-din , vol. 2, p. 516) Denying pretenders: Because of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) secret life, some people pretended that they had relations with him in order to achieve their own interests. In letters to his Four Deputies —especially Husayn b. Ruh —, Imam al-Mahdi (a) denied and condemned such pretenders and liars. For example, al-Shaykh al-Tusi wrote about Abu Muhammad Hasan al-Shari'i , who was the first person who claimed to be a medium between the Imam (a) and people, that he was a companion of Imam al-Hadi (a) and Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) , but he lied about the Imams (a), and Imam al-Mahdi (a) wrote a letter, cursing and condemning him. Karamat (supernatural wonders) and praying: Letters also contain things that might count as Imam al-Mahdi's (a) divine powers and karamat (theurgies), such as his praying for Shiites, informing them of other people's unknown financial rights and other secrets. Evaluation of tawqi'at The letters with jurisprudential contents have been appealed to by early jurists , but recently they have been more appealed to by scholars. Most of them are considered to be reliable by jurists, but some of them are not taken to be reliable. What is more, a correspondence is, for some scholars of jurisprudence , not as reliable as oral words heard by narrators of hadiths . Moreover, only the letters sent by Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Minor Occultation by his Four Deputies are reliable, and the ones allegedly issued after that are not reliable. Here is a couple of letters attributed to Imam al-Mahdi (a) after the Minor Occultation: The letters allegedly sent by Imam al-Mahdi (a) to al-Shaykh al-Mufid . The letters are said to be sent to al-Shaykh al-Mufid by a trusted person, who remained anonymous. There is serious doubt about the attribution of these letters to Imam al-Mahdi (a). [16] Some contemporary writers have considered a message sent by Shaykh Muhammad Kufi Shushtari to Sayyid Abu l-Hasan al-Isfahani to be a tawqi'. Sources of tawqi' The most important source for Imam al-Mahdi's (a) tawqi'at are Kamal al-din by al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Ghayba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi . There is a chapter in these books devoted to the tawqi'at. Other chapters also contain some tawqi'at. al-Kulayni , who lived during the Minor Occultation in the main centers of hadith ( Qom , Rey and Baghdad ), cited some tawqi'at in the first volume of his al-Kafi . Later these letters were cited and elaborately reported in some collections of hadiths, such as al-Ihtijaj , Ma'adin al-hikma , Bihar al-anwar and contemporary books regarding Imam al-Mahdi (a) and his correspondences (such as the seventh volume of 'Ali Ahmadi Miyanaji 's Makatib al-A'imma ).

So wait! Soon you will know who are the people of the right path, and who is [rightly] guided.’ Qur'an 20:135 In a hadith of Imam al-Kazim (a), “the right path” is interpreted as the path of Imam Mahdi (a) and the “guided” as those who are guided to obey him. 18 And we used to deny the Day of Retribution until death came to us.’ Qur'an 74 :46-47 “Day of retribution” and “ ” (lit. certainty) are interpreted in a hadith as referring to the days of al-Qa'im. 19 Do you not see that Allah has disposed for you whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth and He has showered upon you His blessings, the outward, and the inward?...

Qur'an 42:20 “He will have no share in the hereafter” is interpreted to mean, he will have no share during the reign of Imam Mahdi (a). 47 Soon We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own souls until it becomes clear to them that He is the Real. Qur'an 41:53 Imam al-Baqir (a) has interpreted this verse as referring to the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 48 ...We might make them taste a humiliating punishment in the life of the world...

So the bolt of a humiliating punishment seized them because of what they used to earn. Qur'an 41:17 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have interpreted Thamud in this verse as referring to a group of the Shia who, like the historical people of Thamud, denied the truth. The Imam (a) also reportedly interpreted the “bolt” as referring to the punishment of sword upon the return of the Twelfth Imam. 50 The earth will glow with the light of her Lord, Qur'an 39:69 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that the lord of the earth is the Imam of the earth whose light will illuminate the earth. 51 and you will surely learn its tidings in due time.’ Qur'an 38:88 It is said, in a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a), that the “due time” refers to the time of the return of al-Mahdi (a). 52 Indeed Abraham was among his followers, Qur'an 37:82 According to a hadith, this verse is about the Imams (a), including Imam Mahdi (a) and his followers. 53 Were you to see them when they will be stricken with terror, without any escape, and are seized from a close quarter. Qur'an 34:51 According to a number of hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imam al-Baqir (a), among the instances of this verse is the revolt of al-Sufyani near the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 54 Say, ‘On the day of judgement their [newly found] faith will not avail the faithless, nor will they be granted any respite.’ Qur'an 32:29 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said, the “day of victory” is the day when the world will be subdued to al-Mahdi (a). 55 We shall surely make them taste the nearer punishment prior to the greater punishment, so that they may come back. Qur'an 32:21 It is said, in a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), that “the greater punishment” is the uprising of Imam Mahdi (a) with sword during the end times. 56 and on that day the faithful will rejoice Qur'an 30:04 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that the rejoicing of believers is on the day of the return of al-Mahdi (a). 57 If We wish We will send down to them a sign from the sky before which their heads will remain bowed in humility. Qur'an 26:4 Imam al-Baqir (a) reportedly said that this verse is about Mahdi (a), whose name will be announced from heaven. 58 Tell me, should We let them enjoy for some years, (205) then there comes to them what they have been promised, (206) of what avail to them will be that which they were given to enjoy? (207) Qur'an 26 :205-207 In a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), it is said that “that [which] they were promised” refers to the return of Imam Mahdi (a) and “the enjoyment of the days they were given” refers to the Umayyad rule. 59 Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is a niche wherein is a lamp—the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star—lit from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil almost lights up, though fire should not touch it. Light upon light. Qur'an 24:35 According to a hadith, the light of God in this verse refers to Imam Mahdi (a). 60 Those who, if We granted them power in the land, will maintain the prayer, give the zakat, bid what is right and forbid what is wrong. And with Allah rests the outcome of all matters. Qur'an 22:41 In some hadiths, this verse is said to be about Imam Mahdi (a) and his companions. 61 They say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘[The knowledge of] the Unseen belongs only to Allah. So wait. I too am waiting along with you.’ Qur'an 10:20 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have interpreted the “hidden” in this verse as referring to Imam Mahdi (a). 62 Do those who devise evil schemes feel secure that Allah will not make the earth swallow them, or the punishment will not overtake them whence they are not aware? Qur'an 16:45 According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), this verse refers to the uprising of a man from the family of the Prophet with 313 men and to the swallowing by the earth in Bayda’. 63 Allah’s edict is coming! So do not seek to hasten it. Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]. Qur'an 16:1 According to some hadith, the command of God in this verse refers to the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 64 When the apostles lost hope and they thought that they had been told lies, Our help came to them, and We delivered whomever We wished, and Our punishment will not be averted from the guilty lot. Qur'an 12:110 Imam Ali (a) is reported to have said that believers will have a difficult life during the occultation until God blesses them with the return of Mahdi (a). 65 O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority among you. Qur'an 4:59 It is said the hidden Imam will benefit people as the sun behind clouds benefits people. 66 Do they seek a religion other than that of Allah, while to Him submits whoever there is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be brought back? Qur'an 3:83 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that this verse refers to the return of Imam Mahdi (a) and the guidance of all people to the One God at his time. 67 The day when some of your Lord’s signs do come, faith shall not benefit any soul that had not believed beforehand and had not earned some goodness in its faith. Say, ‘Wait! We too are waiting!’ Qur'an 6:158 Imam al-Sadiq (a) reportedly said, “the day when some of your Lord’s sings do com” refers to the day of the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 68 Among the people of Moses is a nation who guide [the people] by the truth and do justice thereby. Qur'an 7:159 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that some of the believers among the people of Moses (a) will be among the companions of Imam Mahdi (a). 69 He said, ‘If only I had the power to deter you, or could take refuge in a mighty support!’ Qur'an 11:80 Imam al-Sadiq (a) reportedly interpreted the “power” as referring to the power of Imam Mahdi (a) and “a mighty support” to his companions and supporters. 70 Those who are fought against are permitted [to fight] because they have been wronged, and Allah is indeed able to help them Qur'an 22:39 Imam al-Sadiq (a) has reportedly said that this verse is about Mahdi (a) who will revenge for the murder of Imam al-Husayn (a) . 71 Indeed they are devising a stratagem, (15) and I [too] am devising a plan. (16) So respite the faithless; give them a gentle respite. (17) Qur'an 86 :15-17 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that respiting the faithless means respiting them until the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 72 Is He who answers the call of the distressed [person] when he invokes Him and removes his distress, and makes you successors on the earth...? What! Is there a god besides Allah? Little is the admonition that you take. Qur'an 27:62 In some hadiths, this verse is referred to the uprising of Imam Mahdi (a) and “the distressed” is said to indicate him.

{"title": "Shahadatayn", "text": "Shahādatayn (Arabic: الشهادتين , literally: two testimonies) is to testify or stand witness to the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad (s) . Whoever utters shahadatayn counts as a Muslim and will be subject to Islamic rulings. Shiite jurists discuss shahadatayn in different sections of jurisprudence . According to their fatwas , it is recommended to suggest shahadatayn to a person who is about to die and to write shahadatayn on a deceased person's shroud . Definition Shahadatayn is to testify or stand witness to the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad (s). According to jurists, shahadatayn consists in an utterance of two sentences or any other expression of their contents: \"I testify that there is no god except Allah and I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.\" According to al-Shaykh al-Saduq , shahadatayn consists in an endorsement of monotheism and prophethood as two principles of Islam . Jurisprudential and Legal Significance Muslims take shahadatayn to be the borderline of Islam and disbelief (kufr). That is to say, if someone utters shahadatayn, Islamic rulings will apply to him, such as the cleanliness of his body and the respect for his life and property. According to al-Shaykh al-Saduq, \" Iman \" (faith) is interpreted in some hadiths as shahadatayn. According to Allama Tabataba'i , iman has degrees the first of which is a heartfelt belief in the content of shahadatayn, which leads to the performance of the ancillary or practical rulings of Islam. In jurisprudential books, shahadatayn is discussed in sections such as the rulings of the dead, cleanliness, business, prayer , and jihad . Manners and Rulings According to the majority of Shiite jurists, it is obligatory to utter shahadatayn in the Funeral Prayer after the first takbir . However, some jurists take this to be recommended. [12] It is recommended to suggest shahadatayn as well as the imamate of the Imams of the Shi'a to a person who is about to die. [13] It is recommended to inscribe on the shroud of a dead person that he or she has endorsed shahadatayn. [14] According to the majority of jurists , it is recommended for an imam of the Friday Prayer to utter shahadatayn in his sermons of the Prayer. [15] According to the Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi , the author of Jawahir al-kalam , it is a good manner to utter shahadatayn when one arrives in his place of business every day. [16] Uses in the Islamic Culture Shahadatayn is frequently uttered in supplications and rituals of Muslims. For instance, they utter shahadatayn in the tashahhud of their prayer as well as in their adhan and iqama . Shahdatayn was also used in Islamic architecture, calligraphy, and coin mintage.

{"title": "Mahdi", "text": "Mahdī (Arabic: مَهدی ) means the one who is guided by God . In Islamic hadiths , \"Mahdi\" is a title of the Islamic savior , and according to Shiite beliefs, this is the title of the Twelfth Imam (a) who is going to fill the earth with justice. Since the Prophet (s) prognosticated the emergence of a savior called \"Mahdi\" from his own household, since few days after the demise of the Prophet (s) until now, Muslims are waiting for the emergence of Mahdi (a) . Some Islamic sects such as Zaydiyya and Banu 'Abbas gave the title, “Mahdi,” to leaders of their uprisings against established governments and promised to enforce justice and remove injustices, whereby they managed to attract masses of people, who believed in the promised Mahdi (a) , to themselves and thus they established their own governments. On some accounts, in the early Islamic period, the title, \"Mahdi,\" was used for prominent figures as a sign of honor and respect. Some scholars contend that the first person who used \"Mahdi\" in its doctrinal use as a savior was Abu Ishaq Ka'b b. Mata b. Haysu' al-Himyari (d. 34/654-5). Literal Meaning In Arabic, \"Mahdi\" is an object adjective, meaning the one who is guided by God. The word comes from the root, “h-d-y,” which means guidance from grace and benevolence. Guidance here seems to be contrasted to misguidance, implying spiritual guidance. The word, “Mahdi,” does not appear in the Qur'an , although other cognates of the word do appear therein, including two verses in which the subject adjective of the root, “h-d-y,” which means the one who guides appear. Terminology In Islamic hadiths, when unqualified, “Mahdi” means the promised savior from the household of the Prophet (s) , who will fill the world with justice when it was filled with injustice. According to Shiite doctrines, he is the Twelfth Imam who is occulted at present. In Imami Shiite hadiths, Mahdi is referred to with other titles as well, such as \" Qa'im Al Muhammad \". Sunnis often use “Mahdi” in its plural form to describe the four caliphs immediately after the Prophet—those they call \" Rashidun Caliphs \"—as “al-Khulafa' al-Rashidun al-Mahdiyyun” (the guided Rashidun Caliphs). History In hadiths transmitted by both Shi'as and Sunnis, the Prophet (s) promises that a man from his family named “Mahdi” will appear, stating that he will fill the earth with justice, as it was filled with injustice. Thus, since the days after the demise of the Prophet (s), Muslims were waiting for the emergence of Mahdi (a) . In the early Islamic period, the title of Mahdi was given to prominent figures as a sign of honor and respect. Hassan b. Thabit (d. 54/673-4) wrote an ode for the Prophet (s) in which he used the title for the Prophet (s) as well: Alas, al-Mahdi [the Prophet] is now buried O the best person who has inhabited the earth, do not go away! Moreover, Sulayman b. Surad referred to Imam al-Husayn (a) after his martyrdom as Mahdi the son of Mahdi. Rajkowski claims that the first person who made a religious doctrinal use of “Mahdi” as a savior was Abu Ishaq Ka'b b. Mata b. Haysu' al-Himyari (d. 34/654-5). The Title, Mahdi, in Kaysanites Karbiyya , a branch of Kaysanites , believed after the death of Muhammad b. Hanafiyya that he was still alive and that he was the expected Mahdi. Some authors of religions and sects hold that Muhammad b. Hanafiyya was the first person in Islamic history who was given the title of Mahdi. In Titles of Abbasid Caliphs Official titles, especially early after the Abbasid movement—that is, the period of the first five Abbasid caliphs—had a Mahdawi nature. Abbasids used these titles for certain goals and purposes, because these titles expressed people's emotions, particularly those of poor and impoverished people who always hoped for better days to come. Mahdi or the expected savior meant the end of injustice, cruelty and a harbinger of a golden age and the age of justice and well-being. Such an attempt was made by Abbasid Caliphs to attracted masses who believed in Mahdi to the new government. This helped the victory of their movement to a large extent, and then it established the tenets of the new government. The ruling caliphs constantly transmitted the hopes of masses to their crown princes and the next caliph. The task was done with the choice of a new title in order to display him as savior. When the Abbasid government was solidified and established, it was no long necessary to deploy the tactic of using such titles. Thus, less emphasis was put upon them, and Abbasids forgot their old revolutionary slogans, and adopted more moderate ones which would guarantee the permanence and establishment of their government. This might be a reason why their followers—especially the fanatics among them—were disappointed and then led riots against the Abbasid government. Others tried to find a new non-Abbasid savior to fulfill their wishes, although others complied with the government and began serving in in the variety of their institutes. Common titles in the first Abbasid period (particularly, those of Abbasid caliphs) can be divided as follows: Public official titles, such as Amir al-Mu'minin, Khalifat Allah, and Malik; Private official titles, such as al-Imam, al-Qa'im, al-Murtada, al-Mansur, al-Mahdi, al-Rashid, al-Mu'tasim billah, and so on; Personal titles, such as “Dawaniqi” which was the title of al-Mansur, [13] al-Natiq bi-l-Haqq which was Ibn al-Hadi’s title. [14] His father wanted him to be his crown prince, instead of Harun. In Titles of Zaydi Imams Throughout the history, the title, Mahdi, was used for some Zaydi Imams such as al-Nafs al-Zakiyya , Yahya b. 'Umar, Sahib al-Fakhkh , Yahya b. al-Husayn , and so on. Some scholars of Islamic sects claim that branches of Zaydiyya consider every imam who calls people to himself and qualifies for imamate as an Imam and Mahdi. On this view, “Mahdi” is not limited a particular person.

{"title": "Major Occultation", "text": "The Major Occultation (Arabic: الغَيبَة الکُبرى ) is a term for the period of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) hidden life after the Minor Occultation . This period started from 329 /941 and continues until today. In this period, Shi'as are not in direct contact with the Imam (a). Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a) The disappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , the last and twelfth Shi'a Imam , is called the occultation of Imam Mahdi (a). According to Shi'a teachings, Imam al-Mahdi (a) has had two occultations: The Minor Occultation , which lasted sixty nine lunar years , and the Major Occultation, which continues to the present day. During the Minor Occultation, Imam al-Mahdi (a) communicated with the Shi'a through the four deputies , but during the Major Occultation this communication does not exits and the Shi'a must refer to the scholars for their religious needs. The Beginning of the Major Occultation From the beginning of his imamate in 260 /874, Imam al-Mahdi (a) limited his contacts with the Shi'a to the relations through his specific deputies , the last of whom was 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri who passed away in Sha'ban 15 , 329 / May 15 , 941 . He received the following letter from the Imam (a), one week before his death: \"O 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri! May God reward your brothers for [being patient about] your loss, because you will pass away after six days. So prepare yourself, and do not designate anyone as your successor after your death, because the absolute occultation has occurred. There will be no appearance until God gives permission, and that will be after a long time when the hearts are hardened and the world is filled with injustice. Some of my followers will claim to have seen me, but know that whoever claims to have seen me before the uprising of the al-Sufyani and the heavenly cry he is indeed a liar and a slanderer.\" In this way, after the demise of al-Samuri, contacts with the Imam (a) through specific deputies ended and a new phase of occultation started, which was called the Major Occultation in later sources. Most Shi'a sources mention 329/941 as the year in which the fourth deputy passed away, but al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Fadl b. al-Hasan al-Tabrisi have recorded the year 328 /940. The Role of the Imam in the Period of the Major Occultation According to Shi'i beliefs, although Imam Mahdi (a) is in occultation, the world is receiving the blessings of his existence. The world needs the Imam (a) as the Proof of God for the continuation of its being. The Imam (a) not only has legislative wilaya but also generative wilaya over the world. As 'Allama Tabataba'i explains, the Imam's tasks are not limited to interpreting Islamic teachings and instructing people, but more importantly include his spiritual guardianship (wilaya), that is, leading the people and their deeds towards God , for which task physical presence or absence is irrelevant. Meeting with the Imam During Major Occultation Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of the Major Occultation has been a challenging issue for Shi'a scholars. Some scholars, such as Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Nu'mani , al-Shaykh al-Mufid , Fayd Kashani and Kashif al-Ghita' believe that it is impossible to meet the Imam (a) during the Major Occultation. The most important evidence in this regard is the last letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to his Fourth Deputy according to which whoever claims to have met the Imam (a) is called a liar. Yet the interpretation of this letter has been a matter of discussion among the Shi'a , and there have been different viewpoints among them as to the possibility of meeting the Imam (a) during this occultation. Some people believe that this letter is restricted to those who claim that they met the Imam (a) along with being his deputy or representative. Therefore, a group of scholars such as al-Sharif al-Murtada , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , Muhammad b. 'Ali al-Karajuki and Mirza Husayn Nuri have considered meeting Imam al-Mahdi (a) to be possible during Major Occultation. Many Shiite scholars have also talked about their meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. Those Who Have Allegedly Met the Imam In different Shi'i sources, several stories have been recorded regarding the people who have been able to meet the Imam (a) in the period of the Major Occultation. Some of the most well-known stories include the stories of the meeting of al-'Allama al-Hilli , Bahr al-'Ulum , Isma'il Hirqali, Haj 'Ali al-Baghdadi , and 'Ali b. Ibrahim b. Mahziyar . These stories are narrated in Bihar al-anwar and Mafatih al-jinan and works like al-Najm al-thaqib . General Deputyship During Major Occultation After the demise of the fourth specific deputy in 329/941, Imam al-Mahdi (a) did not appoint any other specific deputies. In this way, all direct contacts between the Imam (a) and the people were cut. According to hadiths related to the occultation--including the one in which the Imam (a) refers people to religious scholars with regard to worldly and religious matters--religious scholars and jurists are generally introduced as the deputies of the Imam (a) in this period.

{"title": "Intizar al-Faraj", "text": "Intiẓār al-Faraj (Arabic: إنتظار الفَرَج ) or the Wait for the Relief is, in the Shiite terminology, the expectation for the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , which will occur miraculously and extraordinarily, as a result of which the world will be filled with justice . According to Shiite doctrines, the Wait for Relief requires spiritual and moral preparations. Terminology \"Faraj\" is an Arabic word meaning relief or release from griefs. In the phrase, \"Intizar al-Faraj\", it refers to the relief that people of the world will have after the Reappearance of the Twelfth Imam (a). The Virtue of the Wait and the Waiting Person in Hadiths Many virtues are mentioned in Shiite hadiths for the Wait and the person who waits (Muntazir). For example, the Wait for the Relief is said to be the best and the most lovely action and the first worship , and the Muntazir is said to be resurrected as a man of God , superior to others at all times, and among Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Imam al-Sadiq (a) says, \"Those who know the matter (i.e. the Imam of their time), they will wait for the Relief\". That is, if one knows the Imam of his time and knows what the Imam expects from his followers, he will then start an uprising against the unjust government, and the Relief (al-Faraj) is the day when the Imam's expectations are met. According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the Wait for Qa'im (a) is said to be a tenet of the religion along with testifying for the Oneness of God and the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Also, the Muntazir is said to be like someone who is in the camp together with al-Qa'im (a), waving his sword along with the Prophet (s), and is then martyred. Duties of the Waiting Person Given different views about the Islamic government in the period of Occlusion, there are different views about the obligations of a person who is waiting for the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). No Particular Duties Some people believe that the Occultaion of the Imam indicates that it is not possible to implement the Islamic rulings; otherwise, the Imam (a) himself would reappear. Thus, no attempt is needed. They believe that the Wait is tantamount to the surrender to the historical predetermination: we cannot help but live under injustice and corruptions until the Savior reappears. Such a Wait is at the service of unjust rulers to silence the people. According to another view about government in the period of Occultation , the Occultation leads to deprivation from all the blessings of the presence of the Imam (a), including an Islamic government. Some people have appealed to hadiths regarding taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) and applied them to the period of Occultation to show that dissimulation and silence towards unjust rulers are obligatory until the Uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Shiite Akhbaris who deny ijtihad reject any social roles for Shiite scholars, including the establishment of a government in the period of Occultation, because for them the views of a mujtahid are only probabilistic and thus unreliable. To the contrary, some scholars appeal to cases, such as a local government being assigned to Malik al-Ashtar or the issuance of fatwas being assigned to Aban b. Taghlib and Zakariyya b. Adam , to show that the views of a non-Infallible should be obeyed by others if that is grounded in his ijtihad. The Muntazir has Heavy Responsibilities However, many scholars believe that a Muntazir has heavy responsibilities. In his criticism of the above views, Imam Khomeini believes that taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) is restricted to ancillaries of the religion ; it is not allowed with regard to the tenets of Islam . He emphasizes that we could not avoid the implementation of Islamic rulings in the last 1200 years, since the Reappearance might not occur until thousands of years later, we cannot avoid this now. For it is not acceptable to shut down the rulings and the Islam. Imam Khomeini defines the Wait for the Relief as follows: \"if a person who waits for Faraj thinks that he should only pray without having any other obligations, then he is not a true Muntazir, even if he acts upon his own Shari'a obligations.\" Imam Khomeini believes that we should expedite the Reappearance by providing its grounds. True Muntazir Not everyone can claim that he is waiting for the Faraj of the Occulted Imam (a) , because people who are waiting for a reformer should themselves be reformed and righteous , and a person can reform himself only if he knows the Imam of his time; otherwise he will be like someone who lives in the Age of Jahiliyya and will die like people of Jahiliyya. The Wait According to the Sunnis The Wait for al-Mahdi is not restricted to the Shi'a . There are mutawatir hadiths about al-Mahdi in Sunni sources with reliable chains of transmitters. In Sunni collections of hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad (s) is quoted as prognosticating that a man from the Household and the progeny of lady Fatima (a) will come, who will fill the world with justice. Abd al-Rahman b. Khaldun, a scholar of the ninth/ fifteenth century —who wrote a well-known prolegomenon to the book, al-Ibar —says, \"Be aware that the majority of Muslims throughout the ages have believed that in the End Time a man from the Household will inevitably reappear, who will support the religion, reveal the justice, and will be followed by Muslims. He will dominate the Islamic territories, and his holy name is al-Mahdi. According to reliable sources of hadiths, decisive Signs of Reappearance are Dajjals riot and other events will take place. [For example,] Jesus (a) , peace be upon him, will follow him and will kill Dajjal, or will reappear together with him and help him in killing Dajjal and will follow al-Mahdi, peace be upon him, in his prayer\". Although Sunni Muslims believe in the Wait for the Reappearance of al-Mahdi (a), they believe that he is not born yet. The Imami Shi'a and some other Islamic and non-Islamic denominations also wait for a savior who is born and alive and oversees the actions, sayings, and troubles of people.

{"title": "Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Meeting with Imām al-Mahdī (a) in the period of the Major Occultation has been a challenging issue for the Shi'as . Many Shiite scholars have talked about their meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. However, some other scholars, such as al-Nu'mani , believe that it is impossible to meet the Imam (a) during the Occultation. The most important evidence in this regard is the last tawqi' by Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to his fourth deputy according to which whoever claims to have met the Imam (a) is called a liar. Some people believe that this is restricted to those who claim that they met the Imam (a) along with being his deputy or representative. Some hadiths have recommended supplications and practices for meeting Imam al-Mahdi (a), and there are hadiths according to which it is possible for special followers of the Imam (a) to have contact with, and meet, him. Some scholars, such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Shaykh al-Tusi have devoted particular chapters of their books to stories of people who have met the Imam (a) and have explicitly confirmed the possibility of meeting him. People who are said to have met Imam al-Mahdi (a) include: Mirza Muhammad Husayn Na'ini , Sayyid b. Tawus , Ibrahim al-Kaf'ami , Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi , Abu l-Hasan Sha'rani , al-Shaykh al-Hurr al-'Amili , al-Muqaddas al-Ardabili , Mirza Muhammad Astarabadi , al-Shahid al-Thani , al-Sayyid Bahr al-'Ulum , al-Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri , and al-Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari . The Meaning of Meeting During the Major Occultation, it is possible for some people to see Imam al-Mahdi (a) without knowing him. It is also possible to see him in one's dreams. There is an agreement among the scholars that these two types of meeting are possible. What has always been subject to disagreements is meeting with the Imam (a) during the Major Occultation while recognizing him as Imam al-Mahdi (a) either during or after the meeting. There is a disagreement about the possibility of such a meeting among Shiite scholars. There are also discussions about having contacts with the Imam (a) through revelations and spiritual journeys and their reliability for religious beliefs or jurisprudential rulings. Before the Major Occultation There is an agreement among scholars about the possibility, and even occurrence, of meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) before the Major Occultation, both during the Minor Occultation and before it. In Shiite books of history and hadith , such as al-Kafi , al-Irshad , I'lam al-wara , Kamal al-din , al-Ghayba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi , and al-Ghayba by al-Nu'mani , some people who managed to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a) before the Minor Occultation and their stories are mentioned. They include Hakima bt. Imam al-Jawad (a) , the paternal aunt of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) who witnessed the birth of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Other people have also been mentioned as those who met Imam al-Mahdi (a) before the Minor Occultation, such as Ahmad b. Ishaq b. Sa'd al-Ash'ari , Sa'd b. 'Abd Allah al-Ash'ari al-Qummi , Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Faris al-Nishaburi , and Ahmad b. Hilal . It is reported in Shiite sources that during the sixty nine years of the Minor Occultation, several people other than the Four Deputies met Imam al-Mahdi (a), including Ibrahim b. Idris , 'Ali b. Ibrahim b. Mahziyar , Ahmad b. Ishaq al-Ash'ari al-Qummi , Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Musa al-Kazim (a) , Muhammad b. Ja'far al-Himyari , and some other figures from Qom . During the Major Occultation There are two views about meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation . Some people believe that it is possible and has occurred as well. The view was first propounded by al-Sayyid al-Murtada and then became popular among recent scholars. It was also propounded by al-Muhaddith al-Nuri , al-Karajuki , and al-Shaykh al-Tusi . According to al-Sayyid al-Murtada, it is possible for divine saints to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a). It seems that initially it was only the possibility of such a meeting which was at issue, but since the time of Sayyid b. Tawus (d. 664/1266) when the stories of such meetings were reported, its occurrence became certain, although some of the stories go back to earlier times. For example, the first story is that of Ibn Qulawayh (d. 368/978-9) in 339 /950-1. In some hadiths, supplications and practices are mentioned for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a). Many scholars wrote works in this regard and there are many accounts of people who claim to have met with Imam al-Mahdi (a). However, some other Shiite scholars maintain that it is not possible for the Shi'as to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. One of the most significant arguments for this view is the last letter of Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to the Fourth Deputy in which he referred to people who claim to meet him as liars. Thus, according to the Imam's (a) command, any claim to meet him should be rejected. Arguments of Proponents 1) Rational possibility: one argument by proponents of the possibility of meeting is that Imam al-Mahdi (a) has a human body just like other Imams (a) and none of the earlier Imams or Imam al-Mahdi (a) or the Four Deputies ever claimed that Imam al-Mahdi's (a) nature changed or that he went up to the sky. This is evidenced by the hadiths in which Imam al-Mahdi (a) is assimilated to Prophet Nuh (a) and Yusuf (a) , rather than Jesus (a) . Therefore, there is no rational reason to take meeting with the Imam (a) to be impossible. Moreover, none of the great and well-known Shiite scholars and authors, such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq , al-Shaykh al-Mufid , and al-Shaykh al-Tusi , believed that it is impossible to meet with the Imam (a). Some of them have even devoted chapters of their books to stories of people who met with the Imam (a) or at least the possibility of such meetings. Moreover, it is very unlikely for several people to claim something impossible at different times without facing serious, public denials. 2) Transmitted supplications and dhikrs for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a): another argument by proponents of the possibility of such a meeting is that there are many hadiths in which supplications and practices are cited for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a). The fact that such hadiths recommend people to recite such supplications and dhikrs shows that it is possible to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a). 3) Hadiths: proponents of the possibility of meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) also believe that there are at least two reliable and acceptable hadiths which imply this possibility: Ishaq b. 'Ammar quotes Imam al-Sadiq (a) as saying: \" Qa'im (that is, Imam al-Mahdi) has two occultations: a short one, and a long one. During the first occultation, nobody knows his place except certain Shi'as, and during the second occultation, nobody knows his place except his special mawali (servants)\". According to another hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a): \"the owner of this affair (uprising) has two occultations: one of them will be long … nobody, neither friends, nor enemies, knows about his place, except a servant who takes care of his tasks\". However, some people have objected to the chain of the transmission of these two hadiths as well as their implications. 4) Accounts of meeting by prominent Shiite figures: there are many reports in different books according to which many people, from distinguished scholars to ordinary people, have met with Imam al-Mahdi (a), and some of them even succeeded to talk to him. The reports are so frequent that they can be said to be mutawatir . This tawatur has been endorsed by Shiite scholars, such as al-Shaykh al-Hurr al-'Amili , Sayyid 'Abd Allah al-Shubbar , and Lutf Allah Safi Gulpayigani . Moreover, some of these reporters are very reliable, great, and well-known scholars. 5) Letters of al-Shaykh al-Mufid: three letters allegedly addressed by Imam al-Mahdi (a) to al-Shaykh al-Mufid might imply that he had relationships with Imam al-Mahdi (a). The letters are cited in Abu Mansur al-Tabrisi 's al-Ihtijaj . Supplications and Dhikrs for Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) Some supplications, Istighathas (beseeching for help), and Visitation Supplications are transmitted for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) , such as the Supplication of Nudba , Ziyara Al Yasin , and al-'Ahd Supplication . Moreover, some supplications have been transmitted with regard to practices and supplications specific to the meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a): 1. In his Makarim al-akhlaq , al-Hasan b. al-Fadl al-Tabrisi writes: \"it is transmitted that if one continuously recites the following supplication after every obligatory prayer , his life will be so long that it would be boring for him and he would finally meet with Sahib al-Amr (that is, Imam al-Mahdi). Here is the supplication: \"O God! Send your peace to Muhammad and the family of Muhammad! O God! Truly your truthful, accredited messenger, your peace be upon him and his family, said that you said: ‘I never doubted anything I do as I doubted the reception of the soul of My faithful servant who dislikes death and I dislike to bother him.' O God! So send your peace to Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten the faraj , victory, and comfort of Your saints and do not bother me and such and such a person (here you can mention anyone you want).\" 2. Another long supplication is also transmitted from Imam al-Sadiq (a) . He said if one recites the supplication after every obligatory prayer, he will meet Imam al-Mahdi (a) while awake or in his dreams. Written Work about the Meeting There are some independent works about the meeting or meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a). Some of these works were written shortly after the Minor Occultation . Moreover, some books or articles are written specifically with regard to meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a).

{"title": "Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "The Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (Arabic: غيبة الإمام المهدي ) refers to the belief that the last and twelfth Shi'a Imam, Imam al-Mahdi (a) , was disappeared. The occultation was conducted at the permission and will of God and is one of the basic and mandatory teachings of the Twelver Shi'a sect. In Hadiths that have discussed the motives behind occultation, the idea of putting the Shi'a to test has been cited. According to Shi'a teachings, Imam al-Mahdi (a) has had two occultations: The Minor Occultation , which lasted sixty nine lunar years , and the Major Occultation , which continues to the present day. During the Minor Occultation, Imam al-Mahdi (a) communicated with the Shi'a through the four deputies , but during the Major Occultation this communication does not exist and the Shi'a must refer to the scholars for their religious needs. In order to explain occultation, Shi'a researchers have written numerous books on the issue, the most famous of which are al-Nu'mani's book on occultation ( Al-Ghayba ) and al-Shaykh al-Tusi 's Book on occultation ( Kitab al-Ghayba ). Defining the Topic According to Shi'a belief, God never leaves the earth without His deputy, the ultimatum, and infallible Imam. After the martyrdom of the eleventh Imam (a) in 260 /874, the twelfth Imam, Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-'Askari (a), who was born in 255 /869, inherited the position. By God's knowledge and will, the twelfth Imam disappeared from sight in 260 /874, although he is still alive and shall reappear one day to free the world from the violence and injustice that fills it, in order to place justice and fairness instead. Lexical Definition The word ghayba ( غَيْبَة , occultation) is derived from the root \"gh-y-b\" ( غ ی ب ). Its definition is opposite to presence and is used to convey disappearance from sight and camouflage . Minor Occultation The Minor Occultation is the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) was in occultation after his father's martyrdom, in 260/874, to 329/941. The Imam (a) helped his followers spiritually, and guided them through his deputies, who are called the Four Deputies . Major Occultation The Major Occultation is the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) went into the second phase of his occultation after the death of his fourth deputy, 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri . There is no interval between Minor Occultation and Major Occultation, and the only difference is that contrary to the period of Minor Occultation, in this period, Imam (a) has no specific deputy, and Shi'a people should refer to the scholars for their religious affairs. The Occultation is divided into two periods to show the lack of connection with Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the second period. According to Shi'a belief, although the Imam is in occultation, the world and those in it all benefit from the blessing of his existence. In other words, the world needs an Imam who has been chosen by God in order to exist. This Imam does not just hold the legislative wilaya (al-wilaya al-tashri'iyya) of this world, but also has the generative wilaya (al-wilaya al-takwiniyya) as well . Therefore, some of the dominant Shi'a sources have a chapter on انَّ الْأَئِمَّةَ هُمْ أَرْكَانُ الْأَرْضِ which means, the Imams are the pillars of earth . Representatives at the Age of Occultation According to Shi'a teachings, it is obligatory that God appoints an Imam. This belief results from two principles; Rational good and badness and the Principle of Grace . This is why the Imam , who has the duty to lead the worldly and religious lives of the human beings, must be chosen by God. At the era when the infallible and chosen Imam is not present in the community, the duty is put on the shoulders of the scholars whom have the conditions for this position to represent him. Leading the human race, according to the Shi'a , is a divine covenant and command, therefore, authority should be established from God, His Prophet, and the infallible successors who have been chosen by God. Reasons and Philosophy of Occultation Shi'a researchers believe that all the reasons and secrets for the occultation are not known, but the hadith emphasize on three things: 1. To Test the Faithful Based on Islamic sources, testing the creation and choosing the righteous ones of them, is one of the constant traditions of God. Life is full of tests for the pious whom use it to nurture their faith , patience and obeying of God's commands and reach perfection by flourishing their talents and abilities. Imam al-Mahdi's (a) occultation is a means to test; as the facade falls from the people with unstable belief, their doubts and uncertainty shall take over, while those whose belief have rooted into their hearts, shall become more experienced and worthy in faith and reach higher levels of piety and divine reward , as they bear through the troubles of time, awaiting the Imam. A narration from Imam Musa b. Ja'far (a) clearly expresses that God tests his creatures, by occultation . The narrations declared that testing people in the time of occultation is of the most difficult testings. The troubles of this test are for two reasons: First: When the period of occultation becomes lengthy, many people will face doubts and uncertainties. Some will doubt his birth, while others question whether he is still alive, but only the honest who have already passed their previous tests and have reached deep understanding will preserve their belief about the Imam. In a long hadith, the Prophet (s) mentions this issue and says, \"Al-Mahdi shall disappear from the sight of the Shi'a and his followers, and no one shall stay stable on their belief, except those who God has put their hearts on the path of faith, and made it worthy.\" Second: The troubles and pressures of the end of times will change the people to the extent that preserving faith and religion shall be a hard objective to achieve. The faith which the people hold will be seriously in danger . 2. To Save the Imam's Life A loot into some narrations suggests that God saved the Imam from the danger of being killed, by occultation, for had he appeared from the very beginning of his life, he would have been killed. Based on the same logic, if he appears before the time is right, his life will be in danger and shall fail to fulfill his Godly objectives and the great reformations he was created to make . 3. Being Free from Accepting the Leadership of the Illegitimate Ruler According to some narrations, the twelfth Imam shall not recognize any oppressive government, even as a dissimulation. He is not obliged to perform Taqiyya ( precautionary dissimulation) for any leader or king, and shall not live under the flag of any oppressor. He will perform God's rulings with no compromise, concern, or secrecy. In other words, he will be in occultation until he rises and thus be free from allegiance or loyalty to any leader or government.

{"title": "Shroud", "text": "Shroud or kafan (Arabic: الکفن ) is set of pieces of cloth that is obligatory to cover the dead body of Muslim by it before burial . It at least consists of three pieces of cloth: a loin cloth, a shirt or tunic, and a full cover. Compulsory Quantity Lexically, Kafn (Arabic: کَفن ) means to cover; but in Islamic jurisprudential terminology it is the special way and order that a dead body of Muslim is covered before burial. In Hadiths , kafan was introduced as the adornment of a dead Muslim and was recommended to be of high quality. Kafan consists of three pieces: Mi'zar (loin cloth); must be long enough to cover the navel to the knee of the dead Muslim, while it is better to cover the body from the chest to the feet. [3] Qamis (shirt or tunic); must be long enough to cover the body form top of the shoulders to the middle of the shins, [4] while it is better to reach the feet. [5] Izar (all-over body cloth); must be long enough to cover the whole body from head to feet and broad enough that the one side overlaps the other, [6] while it is better to be long enough that it could be tied on both ends. [7] The difference between male and female kafan is in some recommended pieces. After putting the dead body in the grave, it is recommended to untie the kafan and put the right cheek of the dead on earth. Other Compulsory Acts There is no need to heirs' consent for spending the deceased wealth on the compulsory quantity of kafan. However, their permission is required for providing a high quality cloth or recommended pieces. Covering the dead body of Muslim is a collective compulsory ( al-wajib al-kifa'i ) and if possible the permission form the guardian of the deceased is required. There are 232 Hadiths in Wasa'il al-Shi'a and Mustadrak al-Wasa'il explaining the details of this ruling. Perfuming the Body Once the ghusl (ritual bath) is performed on the corpse, it is compulsory to perfume the body rubbing camphor on seven parts that touch the earth during prostration (forehead, palms of the hands, kneecaps and big toes). It is also recommended to rub the Turba of Imam al-Husayn (a) on the forehead and palms of the hands. Material The cloth used as kafan must be thick enough to hide the body of the deceased and not be see-through. It is better to be white and not made of cotton. Covering the deceased with usurped or najis kafan and also that made of pure silk or woven form wool or hair of the animals whose meet is haram to eat is not permissible in normal circumstances. Recommended Acts It is recommended that a Muslim prepares his kafan while he is alive and sometimes looks at it and write shahadatayn and the names of the infallible Imams (a) on some parts of it that are less likely to get najis, it is better to write them with the Turba of Imam al-Husayn (a). Jaridatayn (Two Twigs) It is recommended to use the shirt in which the deceased performed prayer or hajj as kafan. It is recommended to put two green twigs, each about half a meter, with the deceased: one from the right collarbone under kafan touching the deceased skin and the other from the left collarbone on the shirt or tunic. The two twigs can be placed in the grave or if burial has finished they can be stuck in the soil at the top and the bottom of the grave. According to Hadiths, the punishment will not reach the deceased as long as these twigs are not dried. Notes References Death Related Beliefs Rulings of the Dead Connection with the Dead Related"}
{"title": "Qiyamat Sughra", "text": "Al-Qiyamah al-Ṣughra (the Lesser Resurrection) (Arabic: القیامة الصغری ) refers to the period between death and al-Qiyamah al-Kubra (the greater Resurrection). Referring to this hadith of the Prophet (s) saying, \"When a person dies, his resurrection will begin\" , some scholars of theology believe that every person has two resurrections: A lesser resurrection and a greater resurrection . The lesser resurrection of a person begins with his death and continues until the greater resurrection. Some theological books use the expression \"al-Qiayamah al-Sughra\" to refer to Barzakh . According to verses of the noble Qur'an , the time of the greater resurrection is unknown and only God knows about it. Fayd Kashani said that as soon as all humans die, the lesser resurrection will end and the greater resurrection will begin; but, the time when all people would die is known only by God. According to hadiths, the lesser resurrection is peculiar to humans, while in the greater resurrection, all beings will be present. In some hadiths and Shi'a books, Raj'a is referred to as the lesser resurrection. In the terminology of Islamic mysticism , the volitional death is referred to as the lesser resurrection.

{"title": "Sacred Side", "text": "The Sacred Side or Al-Nāḥīya al-Muqaddasa (Arabic: الناحیَة المُقَدَّسَة ) is a secret word used by the Shi'a since the first half of the 3rd/ ninth century until the end of the Minor Occultation ( 329 /941). It refers to al-'Askariyyayn ( Imam al-Hadi (a) and Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) ) and Imam al-Mahdi (a) or to Special Deputies . In many letters by the three Imams (a), the word, \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\", is used to refer to the Imam. Two ziyarah texts of Imam al-Husayn (a) are referred to as ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa . Notion The Arabic term \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\" (lit. the Sacred Side) was used by the Shi'a since the first half of the 3rd/ninth century, during the imamate of Imam al-Hadi (a) until the end of the Minor Occultation (329/941), because of tough political and social circumstances of the Shi'a and restrictions placed by Abbasid Caliphs on social communications of Imams. When they cited the sayings of or talked about Imam al-Hadi (a), Imam al-'Askari (a) or Imam al-Mahdi (a), the Shi'a used the term \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\", instead of the Imam's (a) name. Thus, the use of this term to refer to Imam al-Mahdi (a) or his Special Deputies is believed to be out of taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation). The term was used during the Minor Occultation as a title for Imam al-Mahdi (a). 'Ali b. 'Isa al-Irbili takes \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\" to be a secret word used by the Shi'a to refer to Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Letters The term, \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\", was used by people who wrote letters to, and received replies ( tawqi' ) from Imam al-Hadi (a), Imam al-'Askari (a) or Imam al-Mahdi (a). Some letters are cited in Shiite hadith collections written to or received from \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\". Al-'Allama al-Majlisi compiled a book under Tawqi'at al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa (letters of The Sacred Side) in which letters from Imam al-Mahdi (a) to the Shi'a are collected. Ziyarahs There are two ziyarah texts of Imam al-Husayn (a) narrated from Imam al-Mahdi (a) , known as \"Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\". One of which is referred to as the well-known Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa, and the other is known as the lesser known Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa. The well-known ziyarah was transmitted by one of the Special Deputies and is cited in a number of sources, including al-Mazar by al-Shaykh al-Mufid , al-Mazar al-kabir by Ibn al-Mashhadi , and Bihar al-anwar . The lesser known Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa is also known as Ziyarah al-Shuhada' (ziyarah of the martyrs) because Imam al-Husayn's (a) martyred companions are mentioned therein.

{"title": "Visiting Graves", "text": "Visiting Graves Subject Recommendation of visiting graves of believers Hadith-Based/Non-Hadith-Based Hadith-Based Issued by Qur'an and hadiths Shi'a sources Kashf al-irtiyab Sunni sources Sahih Muslim Visiting graves (Arabic: زيارة القبور ) is among Islamic and Shi'a traditions which is recommended according to some verses of the glorious Qur'an and many hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) . Visiting graves has been an important practice for Muslims and there is no disagreement among Sunnis and Shi'a regarding that. The conduct of the Prophet (s), ( sira ) practices of his companions , conduct of Muslims and also rulings ( fatwas ) of the scholars of the four Sunni schools and Shi'a are among the reasons for the value of visiting graves. Relying on the narration of shadd al-rihal , Ibn Taymiyya considered legitimate visiting limited to saying greetings upon visit and praying for the dead one and regarded other practices such as traveling for visiting graves an innovation and an act of polytheism . Many Shi'a and Sunni scholars have rejected the views of Ibn Taymiyya in their works and have considered the narration of shadd al-rihal referring to the great merits of visiting the three mosques mentioned in the narration. Verses, Hadiths and the Conducts of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) Verses of the Holy Qur'an To prove the merits of visiting the grave of the Prophet (s) and also visiting other graves in general, many verses of the Qur'an have been mentioned: Visiting the grave of the Prophet (s): Qur'an 4 , verse 64: \"We did not send any apostle but to be obeyed by Allah’s leave. Had they, when they wronged themselves, come to you and pleaded to Allah for forgiveness, and the Apostle had pleaded for them [to Allah]for forgiveness, they would have surely found Allah all-clement, all-merciful.\" According to verses and hadiths, believers can repent to God near the grave of the Prophet (s); they consider no difference between the time the Prophet (s) was alive and when he (s) is dead regarding the application of the verse; the same way they respect the manners of communicating with the Prophet (s) both during his life and after his demise, such as not raising one's voice beside his grave. The verb \"Ja'uk\" (Arabic: جاءوك come to you) in the verse is mentioned in conditional form which is a sign of generality in meaning and therefore covers both the time of the Prophet (s) and after his demise. Visiting the graves of great religious personalities: In Qur'an 22 , verse 32: \"That. And whoever venerates the sacraments of Allah—indeed that arises from the Godwariness of hearts.\" Those who have mentioned this verse for the legitimacy of visiting graves, consider visiting the graves of great religious personalities a sign of the taqwa of the heart and thus, they have considered any religious sign, a cause of getting close to God . Fadil Miqdad was among the first people who considered visiting the graves of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) among Islamic sacraments. Visiting the graves of believers: Qur'an 9 , verse 84: \"And never pray over any of them when he dies, nor stand at his graveside. They indeed defied Allah and His Apostle and died as transgressors.\" According to this verse, the Prophet (s) was ordered not to pray upon the bodies of hypocrites or stand beside their graves. Many scholars of jurisprudence including Fadil Miqdad, Abu l-Futuh al-Husayni al-Jurjani and Ja'far Subhani relied on the meaning of this verse and emphasized that doing both actions is good to be done for those who are not hypocrites. According to some exegetes , this verse shows the conduct of Muslims and the action of the Prophet (s); for if the Prophet (s) did not do those actions for believers, prohibiting him from doing them about hypocrites would not sound right. Speeches, Actions, and Approvals of Imams (a) According to Islamic hadiths, the noble Prophet (s) not only advised his companions to visit the graves, but he (s) himself visited graves. In Sahih Muslim , it is quoted from 'Aisha that in the last part of the night, the Prophet (s) left the house to visit al-Baqi' cemetery and spoke with dwellers of graves. While after the primary prohibition of visiting the graves in early Islam , the noble Prophet (s) ordered to visit the graves. There are many reports mentioned in historical and hadith books, that the Prophet (s) went to al-Baqi' cemetery, the grave of his mother , and also the graves of martyrs . In sayings quoted from Imams (a), visiting graves has been frequently advised and there are many reports about their conducts in this regard that removed any doubts or questions of jurists about legitimacy, permission, and recommendation of visiting graves. There are many books written with the title al-Mazar or al-Ziyarat which have collected the speeches, practices and tradition of the Infallible Ones (a) regarding visiting graves. Ibn Qulawayh al-Qummi , al-Shaykh al-Mufid , al-Sayyid b. Tawus , and al-Shahid al-Awwal are some of the authors of such works. To prove the legitimacy of visiting graves and to answer the questions of Sunni scholars in their works, Shi'a scholars in theology such as al-Shaykh al-Mufid, al-Sayyid Muhsin al-Amin , al-'Allama al-Amini , Ja'far Subhani, and Sayyid Hasan Tahiri Khurramabadi have referred to the conduct of the Infallible Ones (a). They also have quoted from some Sunni works including Sahih Muslim which contain hadiths about merits of visiting graves. Fatwas of Sunni Scholars of Fiqh Shi'a and Sunni scholars have referred to the many verses and hadiths about visiting graves some of which refer to visiting graves in general and some others are special to visiting the grave of the Prophet (s). In Ittifaq al-a'imma , Ibn Hubayra (b. 499/1106, d. 560/1165), the Hanbali jurists , has said that Malik , al-Shafi'i , Abu Hanifa , and Ahmad b. Hanbal considered visiting the grave of the Prophet (s) recommended. It is quoted from Ahmad b. Hanbal, \"recite the chapters of Fatihat al-Kitab and al-Mu'awwidhatayn when you enter tombs for visiting.\" The Hanbali scholar, Shams al-Din b. 'Abd al-Wahid al-Muqaddasi (d. 663/1264-5) mentioned some hadiths and said that Muslims visited all places in all times and recited the Qur'an for the dead ones. He considered this tradition agreed by all and said that no one rejected it. Two of the hadiths he has referred to are: \"Anyone who passes by the graves and recites Sura al-Tawhid 11 times and dedicates its rewards to the dead ones, he will be granted rewards by the number of them.\" One who enters tombs and recites chapters of Fatihat al-Kitab, al-Ikhlas and al-Takathur and then prays, 'I dedicated what I recited from Your word to believing men and women dwellers of the graves.' They will intercede for him before the Almighty God .\" Muhy al-Din al-Nawawi (d. 676/1277), the Shafi'i commentator and jurist, considered Shafi'i followers and companions agreeing that visiting graves is recommended for men. In addition to the agreement of Muslims, he considered authentic famous hadiths, a reason for this recommendation as well. Sayyid Muhammad Amin known as Ibn 'Abidin (d. 1252/1836), among Hanafi scholars of 13th/ 19th century , regarded visiting graves recommended every week. Visiting Graves in Islamic Culture One of the functions of visiting graves in Islamic culture is remembering death and being aware about the shortness of life. In Ma'na al-ziyara , Ibn Sina (b. 370 /980, d. 428 /1037) mentioned that visiting graves prevents from being drowned in worldly issues and it is a cause of return to God. Fakhr al-Razi (b. 544 /1149, 606 /1209-10), the Sunni scholar in jurisprudence , theology and commentator of the Qur'an has mentioned several benefits for visiting graves and believes that wise people benefit from visiting graves. Even though visiting graves in Islamic culture was not well cared about during the time of the companions , but at the time of the Tabi'un (the followers), it was gradually spread. Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Taymi and 'Abd Allah b. Burayda were followers who helped spreading the culture of visiting graves through quoting hadiths from the Prophet (s) about it. However, people such as 'Amir b. Sharahil al-Sha'bi and Ibrahim al-Nakha'i disapproved of visiting graves and even considered it a cursed action. According to some reports, also al-Hasan al-Muthanna , a descendant of Imam al-Hasan (a) was against visiting graves. According to Shi'a hadiths , dead ones get familiar to the visitors of their graves and miss them if they do not visit for long. In some other hadiths, it is mentioned that dead ones come to visit their living relatives and friends and they will be pleased if those who are alive, have good actions and they will be sad if those relatives and friends, have bad actions. From the documents left from 4th/10th century, it can be learned that over time, visiting graves was not abandoned and even grew and became a common practice. Mystics and Sufis Mystics and Sufis , whether Shi'a or Sunni, consider visiting graves a part of journey toward God and have explained the reasons for legitimacy of visiting graves in their works. Visiting the grave of their Shaykh and staying there, is among the manners of disciples and believers in him. In Nafahat al-uns , 'Abd al-Rahman Jami lists the graves of Sunni Sufis whose tombs are places people visit to be blessed by them, such as Ma'ruf Karkhi (d. 200 /815-6) in Baghdad , Ibrahim Satanba al-Harawi (alive in 2nd/ 8th century ) in Qazvin and al-shaykh Baha' al-Din 'Umar (d. 857 /1453) in Jaghara, Herat . Graves of Hujwiri in Lahore , Nizam al-Din Awliya' in Delhi and Gisu Daraz in Golbarge of Hyderabad Dakan are some Sufi graves, Hindus as well as Muslim visit. Mausoleums in Africa have been burial places for Sufi leaders and have a place for worshipping and places for reciting the Qur'an and staying of visitors which are called Zawiya. Some of these graves in Africa were the graves of women who were taught in these Zawiyas and reached high positions. There are graves of the relatives of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and great Shi'a personalities in Egypt which have been the centers for holding Sufi rituals. Since the end of 13th/19th century and during 14th/ 20th century , the most important Sufi ritual in Egypt was celebrating the birthdays of the Prophet (s), the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and religious leaders near the graves and in the mosques . Ibn Taymiyya and Visiting Graves Ibn Taymiyya (b. 661 /1263 – 728/1328) was among the first people who issued the prohibition of traveling for visiting the grave of the Prophet (s), supplication and asking requests near the grave of the Prophet (s). He claimed that anyone who travels to visit the grave of the Prophet (s) opposes the consensus of Muslims and leaves the religion of the Prophet (s). He also claimed that all Muslims prohibit touching, kissing and putting the face on the grave and none of great people in early Islam did such actions. He considered it an act of polytheism . In the view of Ibn Taymiyya, travelling to visit the grave of the Prophet (s) is a sinful journey and praying in this trip should be in complete form. About visiting graves, the supreme commission of fatwa in Saudi Arabia which is the highest religious position in this country and follows the views of Ibn Taymiyya and Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab has declared that traveling to Medina to visit the grave of the Prophet (s) is not permissible and if someone travels to Medina for work such as business, seek knowledge, etc. can also visit the grave of the Prophet (s) with some conditions. For this ruling, they have referred to the hadith of shadd al-rihal . In this ruling, also asking and making entreaty to the Prophet (s) after his demise is considered like asking and making entreaty to other dead people and regarded an act of greater polytheism. Hadith of Shadd al-Rihal Opposite to the majority of Muslims, a small group have used hadith of shadd al-rihal to declare travelling to visit the graves of the Prophets (s), Imams (a) and great people, forbidden , Makruh (reprehensible). The text of this hadith mentioned in Sunni sources such as Sahih al-Bukhari , Sahih Muslim , Sunan Ibn Maja and other sources is, \"no journey is to be made other than to three mosques: Masjid al-Haram , my mosque , or Masjid al-Aqsa .\" Ibn Taymiyya, the greatest dissident of legitimacy of visiting the graves, wrote in his al-Ziyara : \"Traveling to visit the graves of the Prophets (s) and the righteous is not permissible, due to the Prophetic hadith mentioned in saying, 'no journey is made other than to three mosques: Masjid al-Haram, my mosque or Masjid al-Aqsa.'; and all scholars agree upon the correctness of this hadith and the necessity of following it.\" Elsewhere, he claimed that no authentic hadith of the Prophet (s) is available about visiting his grave and whatever available is either weak or forged. Many Muslim scholars of different Islamic schools have written works to reject the claims of Ibn Taymiyya.

{"title": "Signs of Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Signs of Reappearance (Arabic: علامات الظهور , transliteration: 'Alamat al-Zuhur) are those events which have been predicted by the Infallibles (a) to happen before or on the verge of the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the happening of each of them is considered a good news for approaching his uprising in the world; so that, he (a) will rise after the last in the series of these signs happen. The Siren , rising of Sufyani , etc. are among these signs. Relation with 'Ashrat al-Sa'ah Since the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is considered among the events before the Judgment Day in religious sources, so some of the sign of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are also considered as Indications of the Hour ('Ashrat al-Sa'a). Number In religious sources, there are many natural, unnatural and socio-political events have been mentioned as the signs of reappearance . It is clear that the validity of all these signs is not the same. Some of the narrations mentioning these signs exist in authentic sources and they are authentic regarding the reference and argument. Some others are mentioned either in non-authentic books or by unreliable people. Some of these signs are just signs of reappearance and some are also signs before the Judgment Day. Some signs are general and essential and some others are details and minor issues which can be categorized under one title. What seems to be important is that frequency of these narrations assures us that on the verge of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) some events will occur, some of which will be significant and world-scale and some others are less important. However, there are some narrations which have mentioned some signs together. Types Signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are various and counting all of them is neither useful nor necessary; since, many of them are not definite signs of reappearance. Moreover, some of them have problems regarding reference and content and their authenticity is not clear. Therefore, in categorization of the signs, only the following criteria are considered here: Definite and Indefinite Among the signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), some have been mentioned as \"definite\" which are those, occurrence of which is definite without any precondition or prerequisite so that Imam al-Mahdi (a) will not return if they do not happen. From many narrations among which there are authentic hadiths , five signs can be found as definite: Rising of Sufyani , Rising of Yamani , Siren in the sky , murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya (the purified soul) and al-Khasf bi-l-Bayda' (Burying in Bayda). Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"five events are signs before the rising of the Riser (al-Qa'im): Siren in the sky, rising of Sufyani, Khasf bi-l-Bayda', rising of Yamani, murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya.\" There are also signs which are indefinite, i.e. they depend on other events to happen. In other words, indefinite signs may or may not happen before Imam al-Mahdi (a) comes. Some signs which have not been declared as definite are: Different causes of death Frequent earthquakes Wars and worldwide uprisings Unexpected lunar and solar eclipse Heavy rains Preceding and Non-preceding Based on some hadiths , some signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are just preceding to it so that there is not a long time between happening them and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Although, it is not clear how long is the time between happening them and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), but it is not long for sure and most probably such signs happen in the same year of reappearance or the year before it. Therefore, there is no doubt that some signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) happen near or just before reappearance of imam al-Mahdi (a) and there are some other signs which will happen in the period of the Major Occultation . Unusual Signs Happening of the signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is in a natural manner, but the prediction of some of them suggests that their happening is naturally impossible and they will happen as miracles such as rising of the sun from the West and the siren from sky which will be miracles if their apparent meanings are intended. However, they might have a figurative meaning and refer to events which naturally happen. It should be said that there are many narrations about the signs of reappearance, but their references are weak and unreliable and there is not firm reasoning connection between them. It seems that the great importance of the issue of Mahdism on the one hand, and the great interest of Muslims in knowing how future events and signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) happen on the other hand have made the enemies, especially cruel rulers, alter and distort in narrations in order to achieve their own political interests. Now we have a multitude of authentic and non-authentic narrations about reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), at least some of which have been altered and distorted. Unfortunately, there are also some books which either ignorantly or intentionally help this confusion. However, there are cases of forgery or distortion about the signs of reappearance or emerging False Claimants as a sign which can never invalidate all narrations or signs since some of them are definite and authentic. Ambiguity Some of the signs are clear regarding meaning and message, while some others are very ambiguous and complicated to understand. Many contemporary authors have mentioned these narrations and tried to interpret them based on their personal opinions. However, many of such authors do not have the scholarly competence to interpret these narrations and thus following such personal interpretations. A beneficial example is as follows: When discussing the signs of reappearance in al-Irshad , al-Shaykh al-Mufid writes, \"…and coming of Turks to the island and coming of Romans to the desert…\" Currently, Turks are in Iran , North of Iraq , Caucasus and Azerbaijan , so what does the phrase mean? And who are these Turks? What does \"the island\" mean? Today, Romans can include all the Europe and they even can include Americans since they immigrated from Europe. Also, words \"West\" or \"East\" have been mentioned in narrations and the question is what do they mean? Far East? Middle East? Far West? Or West of Arab countries including Libya , Tunisia , Algeria and Morocco ? In any case, it cannot definitely be said who or where the names in these narrations refer to today and it is needed to wait for the time to define these signs as there are.

{"title": "Special Deputyship", "text": "Special deputiship (Arabic: النیابة الخاصّة , al-Nīyāba al-Khāṣṣa) is the appointment of someone as a deputy of the Imam al-Mahdi (a) in order for people to contact him when it is not feasible for them to directly contact the Imam (a). In these circumstances, the Imam (a) appoints particular persons as his deputies. The special deputy should be introduced to people either by the Imam (a) himself or by a previous special deputy. Some historians take \"niyaba\" to imply absolute succession, and they believe that only Imam al-Mahdi's (a) special deputies during the Minor Occultation , known as the Four Deputies (\"al-nuwwab al-arba'a\"), count as \"na'ib\" (special deputy) and absolute successors of the Imam (a). According to this view, even the highest-ranking representatives of the Imams (a) in the period of their presence do not count as their absolute surrogates and special deputies, because people still had direct contacts with the Imams (a) in those periods. Thus, they are referred to as the Imam's (a) ambassadors or representatives (wakil). The special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) were four people: 'Uthman b. Sa'id , Muhammad b. 'Uthman , al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti , and 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri . When the Minor Occultation began, a number of the Shi'as and certain companions of Imam al-Mahdi (a) pretended that they were special deputies of Imam (a). Some of them were mentioned in a letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in which false deputies are reproached and cursed . The false claim to the position of special deputyship was not limited to the period of the Minor Occultation. Some people falsely claimed to be special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of Major Occultation as well. Notion The term, \"nāʾib\" (Arabic: نائب ) is used to mean a successor, a surrogate, or a deputy. According to one view, the use of the term to mean bab , absolute representative, and the only mediator between Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the Shi'as is restricted to the four deputies in the period of the Minor Occultation , and the representatives of the Imams (a) during their presence were not called \"na'ib\", because there was still a direct contact between the Imams (a) and the Shi'as although those people served as representatives or babs of the Imams (a). Thus, the highest-ranking representatives of the Imams (a) in the period of their presence do not count as \"na'ib\", successors, or absolute surrogates of the Imam (a). One piece of evidence for this view is the use of the term, \"wakīl\" (Arabic: وکیل , representative), for 'Uthman b. Sa'id in the period of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) , and the use of the term, \"na'ib\" (deputy), for him in the period of Imam al-Mahdi (a) by Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi . Imam al-Mahdi's (a) Special Deputies Four companions of the Imams (a) were appointed as special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of the Minor Occultation. On behalf of Imam al-Mahdi (a), they were successively in contact with the Imam's (a) representatives in the most distant areas of the Islamic territories and delivered the messages and requests of the Shi'as to the Imam (a) and the replies of the Imam (a) to the Shi'as. The first special deputy of the Imam al-Mahdi (a) was Uthman b. Sa'id al-Amri . After his death in 265 /878, he was succeeded by his son, Muhammad b. Uthman as the second special deputy of the Imam (a). Muhammad b. Uthman served as the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a) for forty years. Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti and Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri were the third and the fourth special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) who served in this position for twenty one and three years, respectively. When the period of the Minor Occultation ended in 329 /941, the period of special deputies ended as well. Pretenders of the Position of Special Deputy Throughout the history, some companions of the Imams (a) and other Shi'as pretended to be special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Some of them are mentioned in a letter from Imam al-Mahdi (a) in which pretenders of the position of special deputy are reproached and cursed. Al-Shalmaghani Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Abi l-'Azaqir, known as al-Shalmaghani, was a companion of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) and a Shiite muhaddith in Baghdad in the period of the Minor Occultation. He is mentioned in a letter of Imam al-Mahdi (a) to Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti in which pretenders of the position of \"niyaba\" (special deputy) are reproached and cursed and the Shi'as are warned not to follow them. Al-Shari'i Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Shari'i was a companion of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a). He was the first person who pretended to be a special deputy, attributed false remarks to the Shiite Imams (a) , and exaggerated about them. He is mentioned in a letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in which pretenders of the position of special deputy are reproached and cursed. Muhammad b. Nusayr al-Namiri Muhammad b. Nusayr al-Namiri was a companion of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a). After al-Shari'i, he pretended to be the special deputy. His claim led Muhammad b. 'Uthman al-'Amri , the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a), to curse him. Muhammad b. Ali b. Balal Abu Tahir Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Balal was a Shiite scholar of jurisprudence , theology , and hadith , a companion of Imam al-Hadi (a) , and a representative of the Eleventh Imam (a) . He was such a great scholar that even al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti , the third special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a), consulted him with regard to some theological problems and was considered as one of his students. Another student of his was Ali b. Ibrahim al-Qummi . He did not accept the position of Uthman b. Sa'id as the special deputy and pretended that he was the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Ahmad b. Hilal al-Karkhi Ahmad b. Hilal al-Karkhi, known as \"al-'Abarta'i\", was a companion of the Tenth and the Eleventh Imams (a). Al-Shaykh al-Tusi mentioned him among the pretenders of the position of special deputy. He accepted the position of Uthman b. Sa'id as the special deputy, but denied the \"niyaba\" of his son, Muhammad b. 'Uthman . In a letter from Imam al-Mahdi (a) to al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti, Ahmad b. Hilal is cursed by the Imam (a) because of his denial of the Muhammad b. Uthman's \"niyaba\". However, in his al-Fihrist , al-Shaykh al-Tusi has only pointed to his being a Ghali (that is, a person who exaggerates about Imams), without mentioning his claim to be a special deputy. Al-Najjashi believes that Ahmad b. Hilal was reproached by Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a). There were correspondences between him and Imam al-Askari (a). Al-Husayn b. Mansur al-Hallaj Al-Husayn b. Mansur al-Hallaj was a well-known Sufi in the 3rd/9th and 4th/10th centuries. His conflicts with the Abbasid Caliphate and his execution on the basis of a fatwa by Sunni jurists imply that he was an Imami or, at least, he had Shiite tendencies. He tried to gather the Shi'as around himself and, to some extent, he succeeded to gather a number of Shi'as who had Sufi tendencies, but Imami scholars in Qom and Baghdad strongly rejected his invitations. Al-Hallaj's claim to be the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and a letter he sent to people of Qom to follow him led Abu l-Hasan 'Ali b. al-Husayn b. Babawayh , the father of al-Shaykh al-Saduq and the authority of the Shi'as in Qom in the 4th/10th century, to tear the letter apart and strongly reproach al-Hallaj. He finally deported al-Hallaj from Qom. Al-Hallaj also sent a letter to Abu Sahl al-Nawbakhti , the leader of the Shi'as in Baghdad, in which he claimed to be the special deputy of the Twelfth Imam (a) and invited the Shi'as of Baghdad to follow him. Abu Sahl opposed al-Hallaj's invitation. Al-Hallaj was eventually disgraced after he failed to meet al-Nawbakhti's request to show a miracle by turning the latter's white hair into black.

{"title": "Uprising of al-Khurasani", "text": "The Uprising of al-Khurāsānī (Arabic: خروج الخُراسانيّ ) is a sign of Imam al-Mahdi ’s (a) reappearance . This is an uprising that will be led by a person from Khorasan simultaneously with al-Sufyani ’s and al-Yamani ’s uprisings. Some researchers believe that al-Khurasani has black flags , and his army will defeat al-Sufyani under Shu'ayb b. Salih ’s commandership. There are disagreements between researchers on Mahdism about the black flags. Some believe that the black flags are the same as Abu Muslim al-Khurasani ’s flags in his uprising against the Umayyad government . Others believe that they refer to the uprising that occurs before Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance. Al-Sayyid al-Khurasani An uprising by a person from Khorasan is mentioned as a sign of Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance in the relevant hadiths . The term \"Khurasani\" has its sources in hadiths about Khorasan, the eastern land, and a man who starts an uprising with people of Khorasan. These hadiths do not mention al-Khurasani’s characteristics, including his prophetical descent (being a Sayyid ). However, in his book, 'Asr al-zuhur (The age of reappearance), Ali al-Kourani claims that, in Sunni as well as later Shiite sources, al-Khurasani is said to descend from Imam al-Hasan (a) or Imam al-Husayn (a) , and is referred to as \"al-Khurasani al-Hashimi\". Because of this, he is also known as al-Sayyid al-Khurasani. Moreover, these sources provide further descriptions of al-Khurasani, including a mole on his right cheek and his right hand. Is al-Khurasani’s Uprising a Sign of Reappearance? The uprising by al-Khurasani is a sign of Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance along with Heavenly Cry (a voice from the sky), murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya , the Uprising of al-Sufyani , and al-Khasf al-Bayda' . According to a hadith attributed to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , al-Khurasani, al-Sufyani, and al-Yamani will simultaneously start uprisings, in the same year, in the same month, and on the same day. According to hadiths, al-Khurasani’s uprising starts from the east (eastern parts of Islamic lands) and will proceed toward Iraq . The Encyclopedia of Imam al-Mahdi casts doubts on the reliability of the chains of transmissions of these hadiths. Black Flags and al-Sayyid al-Khurasani The parade of Black Flags is the uprising by people who hold black flags in eastern lands, which is mentioned in some hadiths as a sign of reappearance. According to some hadiths, the flags belong to youths from Banu Hashim in Khorasan, who accompany Shu'ayb b. Salih in his uprising. Some Shiite researchers believe that the black flags are those of Abu Muslim al-Khurasani ’s uprising against the Umayyad government, which led to the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate . Others hold that the flags point to an uprising that occurs before Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance. The author of ' Asr al-zuhur says that al-Sayyid al-Khurasani has black flags, the commander of his army is Shu'ayb b. Salih, and a war breaks out between his and al-Sufyani’s army, in which the latter is defeated. Al-Sayyid al-Khurasani pledges his allegiance to Imam al-Mahdi (a). This account was disputed on the grounds that, in the book ' Asr al-zuhur , a recourse is made to hadiths from Ibn al-Hammad’s al-Fitan , in which al-Khurasani does not appear. Moreover, al-Fitan is not deemed reliable by Shiite scholars, because many of its hadiths were not issued by the Infallibles (a) .

{"title": "Afterlife Bodies", "text": "Afterlife bodies (Arabic: الأبدان الأُخرویة ) are sorts of bodies that were introduced by Mulla Sadra Shirazi in order to explain bodily resurrection . On the basis of some verses of the Qur'an , Muslims believe that our resurrection will be bodily, that is, humans will have bodies after the resurrection, but there are controversies with respect to the details of the bodily resurrection. Appealing to the apparent meaning of the verses, some Islamic theologians maintain that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same body that they had in this world, and they will undergo the events of the resurrection with this body. In contrast, some philosophers have denied the bodily resurrection; they have instead believed in spiritual resurrection . On the basis of his philosophical foundations in the Transcendental Theosophy , Mulla Sadra accepts bodily resurrection, but gives a new account of it. Views of the Theologians Many verses of the Qur'an are concerned with the resurrection, the Dooms Day , and people's return to God; for example, \"Say, He will revive them who produced them the first time, and He has knowledge of all creation.\" Qur'an 36 :79. \"Does man suppose that We will not put together his bones [at resurrection]? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to [re]shape [even] his fingertips!\" Qur'an 75 :3,4. \"Does he not know, when what is [buried] in the graves is turned over\" Qur'an 100 :9. \"And when the Trumpet is blown, behold, there they will be, scrambling towards their Lord from their graves!\" Qur'an 36:51 The apparent meaning of many verses regarding the resurrection is that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same bodies that they had during their life in this world. Most theologians believe that we cannot interpret these verses otherwise; so the bodies with which people will be resurrected are identical with the ones with which they lived in this world. This view is called bodily resurrection . In Shiite theology , the belief in the bodily resurrection is an obligation for any Muslim. But the belief in its specific details is not an obligation. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi says, \"It is an obligation to believe that God will revive all people in the resurrection and He will return people's souls to their original bodies. If anyone denies this or interprets it in such a way that leads to its apparent denial —as we hear some of our contemporary unbelievers— then, by the consensus of all Muslims, they will no longer be believers in Islam . For there are many verses of the Qur'an demonstrating that there will be a new life in the resurrection, and implying that its rejection leads to paganism . And one shall not pay attention to the doubts of philosophers [about bodily resurrection] who say that recreating the nonexistent (I'adat al-Ma'dum) is impossible. One shall not take seriously the interpretations of people who read bodily resurrection as spiritual resurrection . Views of Philosophers Muslim philosophers have tried to provide a rational account of the resurrection and its qualities. Though rational arguments are, in their view, evidence of the necessity of the resurrection and the existence of a world other than this world, the details of how the resurrection will occur—whether it is only spiritual, or both bodily and spiritual, and if it is bodily, whether the body involved is a material, elemental body or it is an imaginal, astral body—cannot be demonstrated by rational, philosophical arguments. This is why Ibn Sina (Avicenna) says: It must be known that part of the resurrection is approved by shari'a , and there is no way to demonstrate it except by shari'a and the testimony of the Prophet (s) —this is the part of it concerning the revival of the dead bodies. We must accept the quality of bodily resurrection and its details in accordance with religious evidence and revelation, since this is the most certain and the most complete criterion for man to acquire assuring truths. On the basis of their philosophical foundations, Peripatetic (masha') philosophers believed that after death, human bodies go out of existence, and since it is philosophically impossible for a nonexistent or annihilated object to come back into existence, human bodies cannot be revived, that is, they cannot re-exist. But the soul, because of its immateriality and spirituality, can never go out of existence, and so it survives the death of its associated body. Since these philosophers could not solve the philosophical problems of bodily resurrection —problems such as the re-existence of nonexistent objects— they have perforce tended to the spiritual resurrection or took it to be philosophically non-provable. Mulla Sadra's View After the Peripatetic philosophers, Mulla Sadra with his foundations of the Transcendental Wisdom , provided a different account of the bodily resurrection . He maintained that though the resurrection is in fact bodily and what is resurrected is the combination of one's body and the soul, the body resurrected in the Dooms Day is a delicate body which is exactly similar to (though not identical with) one's this-worldly body, but it has the disposition or potentiality for the afterlife . These changes in the position, magnitude and the shape of one's body do not threaten one's personal identity or persistence through time, since persons are individuated by their souls and not their bodies. This is why the person in the afterlife is judged to be the same person in this world, though his or her apparent features might have changed. So if the soul survives, the changes or transformations in the matter will not be important. Differences between Afterlife Bodies and This-Worldly Bodies Mulla Sadra enumerates the differences between afterlife bodies and this-worldly bodies as follows: Afterlife bodies cannot be corrupted, unlike this-worldly bodies. [6] Afterlife bodies have a spirit and life—in fact, they are identical with life, that is, their lives are essential, rather than accidental, to them, but some this-worldly bodies have life and some lack it. [7] Afterlife bodies are infinite as to the number of the conceptions and perceptions of their souls, since the arguments for the finitude of the dimensions do not apply to them. [8] Afterlife bodies are intermediate between the two worlds—they combine spirituality and corporeality, and they lack most features and properties of this-worldly bodies. [9] Afterlife bodies do not spatially prevent one another. [10] This-worldly bodies emerge gradually, but afterlife bodies emerge abruptly.

{"title": "Raj'a", "text": " Rajʿa (Arabic: الرَّجعَة ), is the belief that a group of people who have died will return to the Earth shortly after the reappearance of the twelfth Shi'a Imam, al-Mahdi (a) . It is a belief particular to the Shi'a Muslims. The Qur'an has mentioned the story of some people who have been resurrected after death. Based on some hadiths , a number of perfect believers as well as a number of complete infidels will return to this world. The return of Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) has been especially emphasized. Since there are mutawatir hadiths about raj'a, it is a certain fact. However, details about raj'a are not as certain. Etymology The word \"raj'a\" literally means 'to return'. In the Qur'an and narrations different terms have been used to refer to this doctrinal principle such as raj'a, karra, radd, hashr. However, raj'a is the most popular term. This form of Arabic infinitive (masdar al-marra) for raj'a translates into 'returning once, or to return once'. In Shi'a Beliefs As a technical term used in Islamic discourse and science, raj'a has been coined to represent the belief that at the time of Imam al-Mahdi's reappearance , God will bring back to life a number the deceased to the world with their worldly body. Creating an opportunity for the believers to reach their ultimate perfection is mentioned among the reasons behind raj'a. According to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) , those believers who do not achieve the blessing of martyrdom will achieve it during their raj'a. The purpose of this returning to life is for the Shi'as to aid and help the Imam (a) in his mission and for them to witness the establishment of his righteous government. Similarly, God will also bring back to life a number of the Imam's enemies so that they may taste the punishment of this world and witness, much to their regret, the glory and power of Imam al-Mahdi (a) 's government . Raj'a is considered one of the necessary components of the Shi'a belief system. Al-Sharif al-Murtada , a Shi'a scholar and theologian , says, \"The Twelver Shi'as are of the belief that at the time of Imam al-Mahdi's reappearance, God will bring back to a life a group among the believers, so that they may benefit from the righteous government of al-Mahdi (a), and gain the rewards of helping him and aiding him in establishing this government. A group from among the enemies will also be brought back to life, so that revenge can be taken on them.\" 'Allama Tabataba'i writes in al-Mizan , \"Although the non-Shi'a denominations, accept the belief in the reappearance of al-Mahdi (a), and have widely reported ( mutawatir ) narrations from the Prophet (s) in this regard, they reject the issue of raj'a, and see this to be a belief particular to the Shi'as.\" In Qur'an According to Shi'a theologians and Qur'anic commentators, there are verses in the Qur'an that speak about raj'a. Five verses refer to the resurrection of the dead in the past, these verses confirm the possibility of raj'a. Raising of the seventy companions of Prophet Musa (a) [1] Resurrection of 'Uzayr after one hundred years [2] Revival of a murdered person from the Israelites [3] Revival of thousands of people [4] Raising the dead by Jesus (a) [5] Some verses speak about the happening of raj'a in the future: The Qur'an 27 :83 is about a day in which a group from every nation will be resurrected, the verse is not about the Day of Judgement as on the Day of Judgement all people will be resurrected not just certain groups of them [6] The Qur'an 40 :11 quotes from the faithless in the Day of Judgement that they had died twice and had been revived twice. The two deaths and revivals show that they had experienced raj'a before the Day of Judgement [7] In Hadiths In his Bihar al-anwar , al-'Allama al-Majlisi mentions over one-hundred and sixty verses and narrations on the topic of raj'a. After quoting these hadiths, he says, \"For those who have faith in the words of the Imams (a), no room for doubt remains that raj'a is a true concept. The reason being, that the reports that have been collated from the Imams (a) on this matter are at the level of tawatur .The author of the Qur'anic exegesis Al-Mizan , 'Allama Tabataba'i , believes that these reports have reached a level of tawatur in meaning. So much so that even if a few of these reports were to be problematic or unclear, it would not affect the tawatur of the reports. Furthermore, the idea of raj'a appears in many of the recorded Ziyarahs and supplications, including the Al-Ziyara al-Jami'a al-Kabira , Ziyara Warith , Ziyara Arba'in , Ziyara Al Yasin , and Ziyara Rajabiyya , also the supplications of Wida' and 'Ahd . It is noteworthy to say that while Shi'as believe in raj'a, they do not consider the rejecters of raj'a as non-Muslim ( Kafir ), since raj'a is a necessary belief to be Shi'a, not Muslim, meaning the rejecter will still be in the fold of Islam. It is understood from a number of reports that belief in raj'a is a condition for perfect faith and true Islam. The Time of Raj'a About the time of raj'a, there are three possibilities: shortly before the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam (a); simultaneously with his reappearance; shortly after the reappearance. In some hadiths, whose chains of transmitters are weak, the time of raj'a is alluded to by the quite famous saying \"All wonders [take place] between Jumada and Rajab \" ( اَلْعَجَبُ كُلُّ الْعَجَبِ بَینَ جُمَادَی وَ رَجَب ). However, it is not possible to ascertain the exact time of, and the order of the events related to, raj'a. Those Who Will Experience Raj'a Although there is no doubt that raj'a will take place, as it is backed by widely transmitted hadiths, its details, including the number and identity of those who will return, are not certain. However, the majority of scholars maintain that during raj'a, only the Prophet (s) , the Imams (a) , and the pure believers and unbelievers will return. Prophets and Believers before the Advent of Islam According to some hadiths, Daniel (a) (Daniyal), Joshua (a) (Yusha'), Jesus (a) ('Isa), and Khidr are among those who will return. Also, it is mentioned that some believers and followers of the previous religions, such as the People of the Cave , will return. Return of Jesus Both Shi'a and Sunni sources state that the Jesus (a) will return at the time of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It can be understood from the traditions with certainty that Jesus (a) will return after the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and will pray behind him. According to some traditions, the Imam (a) will give Jesus (a) the leadership and governance of a part of the world. Sunni sources indicate that the duration of the return of Jesus (a) will be forty years. According to some hadiths, Qur'an 4 :159, \"There is none among the People of the Book but will surely believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them.\" is related to the return of Jesus (a). The Prophet (s), Ahl al-bayt (a), and Their Companions The Prophet (s) will return together with Imam Ali (a) . According to some hadiths, all the Imams (a) and some of their companions, such as Salman , Miqdad , Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari , Malik al-Ashtar , al-Mufaddal b. 'Umar , Humran b. A'yan , Muyassir b. 'Abd al-Aziz , and the companions of Imam al-Husayn (a) , will return. Some other hadiths state that pure believers and unbelievers will return, without giving any specific names. Several Returns of Imam Ali (a) According to sixs hadiths, which do not have reliable chains of transmitters, Imam Ali (a) will return several times. And after punishing the enemies, he will rule the earth. The First Returners In Tafsir al-'Ayyashi , the first returners are said to be Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions. A hadith in Bihar al-Anwar , which reports the conversation between Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions on the eve of Ashura , includes a description of what will happen at the time of raj'a. In another hadith, Imam al-Husayn (a) is with Imam al-Mahdi (a) when the latter passes away; Imam al-Husayn (a) perforsm burial rituals for him and then continues his rule for forty years. However, according to some other hadiths, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will be the last ruler. In some other hadiths, the first returner is said to be Imam Ali (a), but considering the hadiths that talk about several returns for Imam Ali (a), it is possible to infer that Imam Ali (a) will be the first returner before the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) will be the first returner after the reappearance. History in Shi'a Denominations In some reports, it has been recorded that shortly after the martyrdom of Imam 'Ali (a) , a group of people from Iraq developed the belief that Imam Ali (a) would return to this world before the final resurrection. Similar beliefs developed in different Shi'a denominations after the death or martyrdoms of personalities like Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya , Imam al-Kazim (a) , and Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) . In Other Religions The concept of raj'a can be found in the Old Testament . The Book of Ezekiel for instance, points towards the coming back to life of the Israelites and the rule of David (a) in the end of times . In the Book of Daniel, it is reported that 'In the end of times, many of those who are asleep within the earth will be awoken' . The New Testament also speaks about the returning to life of the righteous people and the establishment of the Messiah 's rule in the first resurrection, before the coming of the second resurrection . Related Works Due to the great importance of raj'a in the Shiite theological belief system, Shi'a scholars and narrators have written numerous books and treatises on the topic. Unfortunately, many of these works are no longer available to us, and have been lost. Now, only their names remain in the books of rijal and fihrist (lists of authors and their works). Aqa Buzurg Tihrani introduces thirty works written on this topic. Some of the most important ones that have been published are as follows: Al-Raj'a ; Mirza Muhammad Mu'min b. Dust Muhammad Husayni Astarabadi (annotated by Faris Hassun Karim and published by Anwar al-Huda Publications, 1417 /1996-7). Mirza Muhammad Mu'min was martyred in Mecca in the year 1088 /1677-8). In this work, after a short introduction regarding the necessity of turning to the Infallible Imams (a) in all affairs, and submitting to their words, Mirza Muhammad presents more than a hundred narrations on the topic of raj'a. Al-Iqaz min al-haj'a bi l-burhan 'ala l-raj'a ; Shaykh Muhammad b. Hasan al-Hurr al-'Amili (d. 1104 /1692-3). This book was authored in 1075 /1664-5; it contains over one-hundred and seventy narrations, including tens of verses and other proofs to establish the concept of raj'a. Raj'at ; Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi (d. 1111 /1699-700). This book was written in Persian. It contains fourteen narrations pertaining to the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam , al-Mahdi (a), and the topic of raj'a. It is worth noting that al-'Allama al-Majlisi has addressed in detail the issue of raj'a within his other famous work Bihar al-anwar . He presents approximately two-hundred narrations that have been reported on this topic . Al-Shi'a wa l-raj'a ; Muhammad Rida Tabasi Najafi (d. 1405 /1984-1985). This book was published in the year 1378 /1958-9 by al-Matba'a al-Haydariyya Publishers, Najaf . The book consists of theoretical, historical, linguistical, and ethical discussions, with research and analysis. In this book, the status of raj'a in the Qur'an , reported supplications, reported salutations ( Ziyarah ), the consensus of the scholars and the view of reputable figures, has been analyzed and reviewed. In the first chapter of this book, one-hundred and seventy-four verses of the Qur'an that have been interpreted as referring to raj'a according to the narrations, have been mentioned alongside the relevant narrations.

The term is used once in the Qur'an , and different interpretations have been provided for what is meant thereby. In the Qur'an The term is used once in the Qur'an in Sura al-Ghafir verse 15: “ رَفِيعُ الدَّرَجَاتِ ذُو الْعَرْشِ يُلْقِي الرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ لِيُنذِرَ يَوْمَ التَّلَاقِ \"Raiser of ranks, Lord of the Throne, He casts the Spirit of His command upon whomever of His servants that He wishes, that he may warn [people] of the Day of Encounter.\" ” — Qur'an, 40:15.

{"title": "Metamorphosis", "text": "Metamorphosis or Maskh (Arabic: مَسْخ ) is a kind of divine punishment in which one is transformed into an animal. In metamorphosis, the human identity is not lost, while its appearance changes into an animal figure. Some cases of metamorphosis are mentioned in Islamic sources, the best-known of which is the story of People of Sabbath . According to Qur'anic verses , People of Sabbath were people from the Children of Israel who defied God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays, and then, were transformed into monkeys. According to Islamic hadiths , metamorphosis occurs on the day of resurrection as well, when some sinners are transformed into animals such as monkeys and pigs. Some Quranic exegetes interpret the story as allegorical; that is, sins lead to animal temperaments. Such an interpretation is rejected by the majority of exegetes, however. They believe that appearances of the people in the story really changed. Definition of Metamorphosis and its Difference from Metempsychosis Metamorphosis is the transformation of something's appearances into something unpleasant. Metempsychosis is the attachment of the soul to another body after its separation from its own body. In metamorphosis, the soul is not separated from the body. Instead, the appearances of the body change and is transformed into an animal. Preservation of the Human Identity in Metamorphosis According to Muslim scholars, the transformation of human appearances does not amount to the change of his human nature. Thus, metamorphosis is not tantamount to the destruction of a human individual and creation of a monkey individual or the transmigration of a human soul into a monkey body. Instead, metamorphosis is the coincidence of two specific forms. That is to say, while the human specific form is still there, it has received a monkey specific form as well. Hence, the individual should be called a human monkey. Here is how Murteza Mutahhari explains the issue: \"in whatever way I am on the day of resurrection, whether I am with this body or with another body, I am one hundred percent the same person, although my appearances might have changed. Even if I undergo a metamorphosis on the day of resurrection in proportion to my psychological attitudes, and I am resurrected in an animal form, it is still me who has animal organs.\" Occurrence of Metamorphosis According to the Qur'an The Qur'an talks about the metamorphosis of some human beings. For example, the verse twenty of Qur'an 5 is about the transformation of some human beings into monkeys and pigs. Moreover, the verse sixty five of Qur'an 2 is about some people from among the Children of Israel , known as People of Sabbath , who were transformed into monkeys because they disobeyed God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays. Metamorphosis of some Disciples According to some Quranic verses, the disciples of Jesus asked God to send them a table of foods from the sky. When God sent them the table, He said: \"should any of you disbelieve after this, I will indeed punish him with a punishment such as I do not punish anyone in all creation.\" Some exegetes interpret the verse as follows: some disciples betrayed Jesus (a) despite the heavenly table, and then they were transformed into animals by God. Some other exegetes like 'Allama Tabataba'i have rejected this interpretation, taking it to be in conflict with other Quranic verses. How the Quranic Metamorphosis Occurred There are different accounts of how metamorphosis occurs in this world. The majority of Quranic exegetes believe that metamorphosis or maskh in the Qur'an is the transformation of the human body into another animal. Some others believe, nevertheless, that metamorphosis merely occurs in one's inner self, and human face or appearance does not change. Mujahid b. Jubayr (d. 102/720-1) says: \"the metamorphosis mentioned in the Qur'an is an analogy just like ‘the example of an ass carrying books’.\" 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashani said: the metamorphosis occurred merely in people's inner selves. In other words, the Jews who underwent metamorphosis were just like other people in their outer forms, although they were not humans in their inner selves. The same view is held by Rashid Rida and Muhammad Abduh . Notwithstanding this, the majority of Quranic exegetes believe that the metamorphosis in the Qur'an is used literally. That is, it really occurred in people's bodies and their appearances did change. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , there are mutawatir hadiths to the same effect. As to the objection that this kind of metamorphosis is improbable, advocates of the latter view argue that if we accept miracles by prophets , then the extraordinary character of an action cannot be evidence for its impossibility. Instead, this is a condition of miracles. Metamorphosis of Human Beings in Resurrection According to some hadiths, some people will be resurrected in animal forms. For example, Ma'adh b. Jabal asked the Prophet (s) about the Quranic verse, \"the day the Trumpet will be blown , and you will come in groups.\" The Prophet (s) said: some of them will be resurrected in the form of monkeys, some in the form of pigs, and so on.” According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) : \"those who deny the divine destination will be resurrected from their graves in the form of monkeys and pigs.\" Metamorphosis of the Soul Some Muslim scholars believe that human beings might undergo metamorphosis in their souls and thus they might spiritually turn into animals. Some Quranic exegetes maintain that the Quranic verse, \"they are just like cattle; indeed, they are more astray,\" is a reference to this fact. According to Murteza Mutahhari , a man's humanity depends on his moral characteristics, and if he gains the characteristics of a savage animal, then he has indeed undergone metamorphosis.\" Other Examples of Metamorphosis In some Shiite and Sunni sources, there are reports of metamorphosis of people other than those mentioned in the Qur'an. For example, there is a hadith cited in al-Khisal by al-Shaykh al-Saduq according to which thirteen animal species, including scorpions, bats, and bears, were original human beings who then underwent metamorphosis. Moreover, al-Tabarani, a Sunni scholar in third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, quoted the Prophet (s) as saying that some Muslims will undergo metamorphosis and turn into monkeys and pigs. The Fate of Metamorphosed People According to hadiths, people whose metamorphosis story is mentioned in the Qur'an survived just for three days, and they had no progenies. Sadr al-Muti'allihin says: \"Muslims have consensus over the fact that today's animals are not progenies of metamorphosed human beings, since these people died after three days without producing children during their animal period.\" See Also People of the Sabbath Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related"}
{"title": "Day of Separation", "text": "Day of Separation or Yawm al-Faṣl (Arabic: یَوْم الفَصْل ) is a term in the Qur'an referring to the Day of Judgement . Exegetes of the Qur'an maintain that the Day of Judgement is referred to as such because it is on this day that the truth and falsehood will be separated. Meaning \"Al-Fasl\" literally means to \"cut off\" or \"separate\" in a way that a distance is created there between. In the Qur'an The term, \"Yawm al-Fasl\", is used in the Qur'an to refer to the Day of Judgement mainly for the purpose of reprehending and threatening polytheists or deniers. According to the Quran 37 :21 [2] and in Qur'an 44 :40 [3] , it is used to threaten the polytheists, and in its subsequent verses, the meaning of separation (al-fasl) is explained as follows: “ The day when a friend will not avail a friend in any way, nor will they be helped, except for him on whom Allah has mercy. Indeed He is the All-mighty, the All-merciful. ” — Qur'an 44 :41-42 In Qur'an 77 , the term, Yawm al-Fasl, has been used three times to refer to the Day of Judgement. In verses thirteen and fourteen, the greatness of the Day is characterized as follows: “ For what day has [all] that been set [to occur]? For the Yawm al-Fasl! And what will show you what is the Yawm al-Fasl!? Woe to the deniers on that day! ” — Qur'an 77 :12-14) And in Qur'an 78 :17, the Yawm al-Fasl is characterized as an appointed time in which all peoples are assembled [4] Interpretation 'Allama Tabataba'i holds that Yawm al-Fasl refers to the Day of Judgement because, according to the verse seventeen of Qur'an 22 , it separates people. And the Day of Judgement is called Yawm al-Fasl because it is on this day that the truth is separated from the falsehood and pious people are separated from sinners . He takes the verse fifty nine of Qur'an 36 , \"And Get apart today, you guilty ones!\", to be evidence for his interpretation . According to Tafsir-i nimuna , Yawm al-Fasl means the Day of Judgment in which God will adjudicate His servants. In this world, truths and falsehoods are intertwined, but on the Day of Judgement, they will be separated and the secrets will be revealed. Morteza Motahhari interprets Yawm al-Fasl as follows: \"Human beings form communities in this world on the basis of their appearances, but in the Day of Judgement, the reign is grounded in people's interiors and internal habits. In the afterlife , an angel -like person will not be able to communicate with evil people. Thus, there will be a separation between them. People will be resurrected with their leaders in flocks, with some of them having a leader in the Hell and some others having a leader in the Heaven .

{"title": "Mizan", "text": "Mīzān (Arabic: میزان ) or Measure or Scale is a Quranic concept referring to a station on the day of resurrection . In this station, people and their actions are evaluated and measured. Some people take the weight or measurement of actions figuratively, interpreting \"mizan\" as God 's just treatment of people on the day of resurrection, whereas others take human actions to have a measurable nature on the day of resurrection, which will be measured or weighed by an appropriate Measure. According to hadiths , the Measure of actions can be made heavier on the day of resurrection in virtue of monotheistic beliefs, love for Ahl al-Bayt (a) , evasion of sins , recitation of salawat , sincere intentions for the sake of God, avoiding to hurt people, and benevolence for people. The Notion \"Mizan\" literally means a measurement device or a scale, and \"Mizan al-a'mal\" (Measure of Deeds) is a device with which people's deeds and beliefs are measured. The word, and its plural form, \"Mawazin,\" occurs sixteen times in the Qur'an . In some of these cases, it is used to mean a measurement device in transactions; in others, it refers to laws of creation; and in some others, it refers to legislated laws. . Mizan as a Station in Resurrection Mizan is a station in resurrection in which people's overall deeds and beliefs are measured, in virtue of which their respective positions in the Heaven or the Hell will be decided. Based on verses eight to nine of Qur'an 7 , good deeds make one's Measure of Deeds heavier, and sins make it lighter. Thus, it is not the case that people's good deeds are put on one pan of the scale and sins on the other. Each act has its own criterion of measurement, and each act is measured in terms of its most perfect instance. For example, one's prayer is measured against a perfect prayer and one's fast is measured against a perfect fast. In other words, every person is measured against the perfect human being, and his or her actions are measured against those of the perfect human being, which is the most perfect instance of action. Thus, on the day of resurrection, \"Mizan\" or Measure is the perfect man. In hadiths , prophets and their successors are deemed instances of \"just scales\" as occurring in the verse, \"We shall set up just scales on the Day of Resurrection.\" According to al-Ziyara al-Mutlaqa of Imam 'Ali (a) , he is considered as a Scale of Actions: \"peace be upon the Scale of Actions.\" Thus, the scale or Mizan of each nation is their prophets and their successors. As to the Quranic verse, \"and We sent down with them the Book and the Mizan,\" 'Allama Tabatabaʾi takes \"mizan\" to refer to the religion , suggesting that the religion is called \"Mizan\" because people's beliefs and deeds are measured against it, and on the day of resurrection, people are evaluated and rewarded or punished in accordance with the religion. Weight of Actions in Mizan The Qur'an takes people's actions to have certain weights, where by the weight of an action it means its worthiness or worthlessness as far as rewards are considered. Different accounts have been offered of how actions are evaluated and weighed: Some people, such as al-Shaykh al-Mufid , [18] take it figuratively, interpreting it as God's just treatment of people in rewarding for righteous actions and punishing for sins. [19] Some take it literally, maintaining that only righteous actions have weights and sins have no weights. Thus, the lightness of one's Measure of Deeds amounts to scarcity of his righteous actions. [20] Others, such as 'Allama Tabatabaʾi, believe that righteous actions lead to heaviness of the Measure, and sins lead to its lightness, and the net weight is a result of these additions and subtractions. [21] Factors Contributing to Heaviness or Lightness of Mizan Certain factors contribute to the evaluation of actions on the day of resurrection, which is also known as the \"weight of actions\": the significance of the action in the religion, the degree of one's faith and belief, and one's sincerity in doing the action. The most important factors leading to the heaviness of the Measure or the Scale on the day of resurrection include: Monotheist beliefs Love for Imam 'Ali (a) Good moral characteristics Salutation to Prophet Muhammad (s) and his Household Sincere intentions Pure actions Refusal from hurting people Benevolence for everyone Avoidance of sins Patience for the death of a righteous child Long silence Teaching the Qur'an to one's children According to hadiths, some factors lead to lightness of the Scale of Deeds on the day of resurrection, such as jealousy . Nullification of the Action and Mizan According to Quranic verses, God will nullify the actions of unbelievers , and thus, there will remain no actions for them to be measured.

{"title": "Tatayur al-Kutub", "text": " Taṭāyur al-kutub (Arabic: تطایر الکتب ) is a stage of the resurrection in which one observes the book, or record, of his or her actions. This is an Islamic belief, emphasized by hadiths . Following some hadiths, exegetes of the Qur'an take the term to be derived from the Qur'an 17 :13 and 14, and some Muslim jurists take it obligatory to believe in Tatayur al-kutub. Lexicology The word \"tatayur\" literally means to fly, to disseminate, and to dispense. Although the word \"tatayur\" does not appear in the Qur'an, following some hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) , Qur'anic exegetes take the term to be derived from the Qur'an: \"every man's 'tayir' (bird or fate) we have fastened on his own neck\", followed by \"read your book (or records)\". Exegesis Qur'anic exegetes suggested two interpretations of the word \"ta'ir\" in the above Qur'anic verse: First: the word \"ta'ir\" (Arabic: طائر ) has its root in the word \"tayr\" (Arabic: طیر ) which means bird. Arabs used to fly a bird in order to know whether what they sought to do was good or bad. Later the good and bad actions themselves came to be called \"ta'ir\". Second: according to Abu 'Ubayda, by \"ta'ir\" Arabs meant fortune. In the verse immediately after the above verse, we read that the same \"ta'ir\" displays the book of people's actions to them on the Day of Judgment . According to some hadiths, this stage of the resurrection is called \"tatayur al-kutub\" or \"tatayur al-suhuf\". According to a hadith narrated from the Prophet (s) by Aisha , there are three stages of the resurrection in which one does not know or remember anyone: mizan (the measurement of one's good and bad actions), tatayur al-kutub or tatayur al-suhuf, and sirat (the bridge that everyone should pass in the resurrection). According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , \"ta'ir\" refers to the good and the evil that always accompany one until the Day of Judgment when the book of one's actions is given to him or her. Therefore, divine agents ( angels ) record one's actions—good and bad—in this world, and they open the record—the book—to the person after the resurrection, at the stage of tatayur al-kutub. Theologians and jurists take it obligatory for a Muslim to believe in 'tatayur al-kutub' as a stage of the resurrection, because it was mentioned in the Qur'an. Thus jurists maintain that it is one of the doctrines that should be mentioned to a dead person at the time of talqin .

{"title": "Bay'a", "text": "Bayʿa (Arabic: البيعة ) denotes pledging allegiance to the Prophet (s) , an Imam , ruler, or caliph . In Islamic tradition, the first bay'a was declared by 'Ali (a) and Lady Khadija (a) , with the Prophet (s) after accepting Islam as their religion. The first and second al-'Aqaba allegiances are bay'as that took place in Mecca , and these two, particularly the second al-'Aqaba alleginace, paved the Prophet's (s) path to migrate to Medina . Muslims swore allegiance to the Prophet (s) when setting off to the Battle of Badr in Medina . The Bay'at al-Ridwan or Bay'at al-Shajara, happened in 6 /628, in Hudaybiyya . Men and women pledged allegiance to the Prophet (s) after the Conquest of Mecca in 8 /630. The last bay'a which occurred at the presence of the Prophet of Islam (s) was Muslims' allegiance to 'Ali (a) in Dhu l-Hijja 18 , 10 / March 16 , 632 in a place called Ghadir Khumm . The subject of this bay'a was the leadership and succession of Imam 'Ali (a) after the Prophet (s). Bay'a was common before Islam, in Prophet's (s) era, after the Prophet (s), and in all the governments claiming to represent Islamic governments. Literal and Idiomatic Meaning Bay'a is an Arabic word (root: ب ی ع ) that means \"shaking and pressing hands and striking your right hand to the right hand of another person in order to establish allegiance\". Before Islam, it was traditional among Arabs to shake each others' right hands when buying and selling, that meant to determine and finalize the deal and making themselves faithful to its terms. This act of handshake was called \"bay'a\" or \"safqa\" by which the deal was made. Furthermore, to obey the leader of the tribe, the members swore allegiance by shaking hands (Musafaha). Because of its similarity with deal, this action was named bay'a as well. Accordingly, most researchers suggest that the idiomatic meaning of bay'a in Islamic sources and texts is putting your right hand in one's right hand, representing obedience and leadership of him. Gradually, with evolution and variation in the form of bay'a, presently this word also denotes the allegiance and loyalty which this action is a sign of it. Afterwards, it became more ordinary in its second meaning. In Islam The popular meaning of bay'a in the Holy Qur'an , history, sunna , kalam , and Islamic political fiqh is the allegiance that a person pledges to an Imam , ruler, or other person in order to obey him in a particular subject or generally be loyal to the requirements of his oath and commitment. History Before Islam Before Islam, bay'a was commonplace to accept the superiority of a tribe leader, or assigning a person to an important position. Some bay'as can be mentioned as examples of bay'a before Islam such as Quraysh 's and Banu Kinana's bay'a with Qusayy b. Kilab , the great ancestor of the Prophet (s), at the time of his decision to exile Khuza'a from Mecca. During Prophet's Presence First Bay'a in Islam The first bay'a in Islam was 'Ali's (a) and Lady Khadija 's (a) allegiance to the Prophet (s) after becoming Muslim; however, Ibn Shahrashub believes Bay'at al-'Ashira in Yawm al-Dar in the third year of commencing Prophet's (s) mission ( Bi'tha ) to be the first bay'a in Islamic history: During this day, the Prophet (s) was ordered by God to ask people to accept Islam and to request for Banu Hashim 's bay'a. On the basis of Shi'a and Sunni hadiths , only 'Ali (a), who was the youngest of the family, pledged allegiance to the Prophet (s). First and Second al-'Aqaba Bay'as Two other important bay'as occurred in Mecca were the first Bay'at al-'Aqaba (al-Ula) after 12 years of starting Prophet's (s) mission (621 CE), and the second Bay'at Aqaba (al-Thaniya) in 13th year of start of Prophet's (s) mission (622) which both took place during Hajj in al-'Aqaba (a place between Mecca and Mina ). Especially the second bay'a was a preliminary to the Prophet's (s) Hijra to Medina. Before the Of the bay'as taken place in Medina was Muslim's bay'a with the Prophet (s) while setting off to Badr in 2 /624. Bay'at al-Ridwan Bay'at al-Ridwan or al-Shajara occurred in the 6 /628 in Hudaybiyya . This bay'a is mentioned in 10th and 18th verses of Sura al-Fath . In 10th verse, bay'a with the Prophet (s) is considered the same as bay'a with God. In this verse, breaking the oath of bay'a (Nakth) is castigated and reward in other world is considered for those who are loyal to their bay'a. In 18th verse, pious men are promised to obtain victory soon, along with stating satisfaction of this bay'a. After the Conquest of Mecca Another bay'a, in which men and women swore allegiance to the Prophet (s), was after the Conquest of Mecca in 8 /630 which the 12th verse of Sura al-Mumtahana refers to. In this verse, the Prophet (s) is demanded by God to make pious Mecca women pledge allegiance (bay'a) with him. Subjects of this bay'a which is prominent as Bay'at al-Nisa' in tafsir , hadith , and history books are: to avoid Shirk , to avoid theft and fornication (Fahsha'), not to kill their own offspring, not to assign other's children to their husbands, and not to disobey with the Prophet (s) and perform good deeds. Most of historians believe, when Prophet Muhammad (s) wanted to make the pledge, he prepared a bowl of water and put his hand in it, then he would read the terms of pledge and asked women to do the same. As other hadiths state, bay'a was done through shaking hands having clothes on them. On the basis of some hadiths, women's bay'a was in the form of oral bay'a. Apart from these, there have been other forms of bay'a for women referred to in some hadiths. As what al-Qasimi has written, aside from some bay'as such as Bay'at al-'Aqaba al-Thaniya, Bay'at al-Ridwan, and Bay'at al-Nisa' which took place at Prophet's (s) presence and women participated in it, there has been no report of women having bay'a with caliphs or rulers. Seemingly, bay'a was specified only to men in later eras. Bay'a with Imam 'Ali (a) in Ghadir Khum According to some sources, the last bay'a occurring at Prophet's (s) presence was Muslims' bay'a with Imam 'Ali (a) in Dhu l-Hijja 18 , 10 / March 16 , 632 in an area called Ghadir Khumm . The content of this bay'a was the leadership and succession of Imam 'Ali (a) after the Prophet (s). After the Prophet (s) This tradition lingered on after Prophet's demise. The feature of these bay'as was to select a person as Prophet's (s) caliph and Islamic territory ruler, then a particular group or ordinary people have bay'a with him. This change was first started at the Event of Saqifa . During Prophet's (s) funeral, some people such as 'Umar b. al-Khattab , Abu 'Ubayda al-Jarrah , and some people of Muhajirun and Ansar assembled in a place called Saqifa Bani Sa'ida . They disregarded their bay'a with Imam 'Ali (a) and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr , building his succession up. Afterwards, some people had bay'a with him, and some of them were obliged to have one. Bay'a with caliph was preserved by later caliphs like 'Umar b. al-Khattab and 'Uthman b. 'Affan , and was turned into a political tradition. Also, people had bay'a with Imam 'Ali (a), who took over the power owing to their insistence. After Imam 'Ali (a) was martyred , people had bay'a with Imam al-Hasan (a) . Of other bay'as with Shi'a Imams (a) is people's bay'a with Muslim b. 'Aqil on behalf of Imam al-Husayn (a) , and Khurasan people's bay'as with Imam al-Rida (a) as the crown-prince of al-Ma'mun . In Umayyads and Abbasids Era The tradition of bay'a with caliph continued in Umayyads and Abbasids era with changes in form and content. Even though it was with reluctance in some cases, it started to change significantly in form and content since Mu'awiya government. The majority of Sunni writers believe Mu'awiya applied various factors such as applying force and power, threat, allurement, promising a part of government's territory, establishing discords, and conspiracy in order to build up his and his family's caliphate, and making people have bay'a with him and his son Yazid . Little by little, the core of bay'a was mixed with obligation and reluctance. In fact, what was important was having bay'a, not whether to have it freely and optionally or by force and reluctantly. As Yazid ordered his governor in Medina , Walid b. 'Utba , to arrest Imam al-Husayn (a), 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr , and some other people to have bay'a, otherwise they were threatened to death by cutting their heads. bay'a became a ceremonial event, since showing loyalty towards a caliph by bay'a was so common at the beginning of a government or during caliphate for the coming government of his successor or successors. Some bay'as were only in return for promises or spending money and properties, so that the money spent by al-Muqtadir al-'Abbasi for bay'a had become 3 million dinars . In addition, when settling the army, caliph paid an amount of money as \"Rizq al-Bay'a\" in return for bay'a to the army. Apparently, al-Raghib al-Isfahani had looked to this concept of bay'a that stated this definition below the word bay'a: to obey generously in return for little gift. There has been reported special bay'a of army commanders and soldiers of caliph, at the age of al-Mansur al-'Abbasi , al-Mahdi al-'Abbasi , and 'Isa al-'Abbasi . Sometimes, a bay'a, which was for succession of caliph, was reversed by caliph himself and another successor was determined. In Governments Claiming Caliphate On the basis of Shahidi 's opinion, the tradition of bay'a was common in all the governments claiming caliphate such as Khawarij , Fatimids , Umayyads , Andulus, and even Uthmaniyyun. It was common in Iran until the local governments were loyal to the center Islamic caliphate. It apparently was wiped out when Abbasid caliphate was thrown. In addition to governments, the tradition of bay'a existed between the rebellious groups. For example, Iraq people's bay'a with 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr, his friends' bay'a with Zayd b. 'Ali b. al-Husayn , bay'a with Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah knwon as al-Nafs al-Zakiyya , and Khurasan people's bay'a with Abu Muslim al-Khurasani on behalf of Ibrahim al-Imam . Sigha According to historical and hadith sources, bay'a was pledged by a Sigha (contract) in which its subject was contained, and mostly the person stated it. Kinds As it states from its literal meaning, bay'a is in the form of shaking or pressing hands with right hand. Some lexicologists believe this process was the same for \"half\" (swear) and Ta'aqud (deal). Because of this, \"half\" is called \"Yamin\" (means right). Consequently, bay'a is named Safqa. When looking at the Prophet's (s) tradition , men's bay'a was in the way of the mentioned way. Some exegetes explain the sentence 'The hand of Allah is above their hands' in the 10th verse of Sura al-Fath as a pointing to carry out bay'a by shaking hands. Overall, these are other forms of bay'a in hadiths. Also, sometimes bay'a was pledged merely by announcing satisfaction by the person doing it, without shaking hands. Bay'at al-Khass and Bay'at al-'Amm Ibn Shahrashub has divided the Prophet's (s) bay'as into two kinds: Bay'at al-Khass (specific) and al-'Amm (public). Bay'at al-Khass was merely for a special group such as the two bay'as that Ansar had in al-'Aqaba and the bay'a of 'Ali (a) in Yawm al-Dar . Bay'at al-'Amm was for all Muslims, like Bay'at al-Ridwan. Conditional Bay'a In some cases, bay'a was conditional, meaning a commitment was required in profit of the person pledging bay'a. However, sometimes condition is implied from the main subject of bay'a. Apparently, the only conditional bay'a in the Prophet's (s) tradition was Bay'at al-'Ashira , in which caliphate and succession was for the one who pledged bay'a. Some conditions like conforming to God's book and sunna of the Prophet (s) were the conditions of bay'a for some caliphs. Bay'a Through Proxy Sometimes bay'a was carried out through a proxy. For instance, women's bay'a with Imam 'Ali (a) on behalf of the Prophet (s) in Hudaybiyya, Kufa people's bay'a with Muslim b. 'Aqil on behalf of Imam al-Husayn (a), and the Prophet's (s) bay'a with himself on the behalf of 'Uthman -who was not present- in Hudaybiyya. Also, after the lands under control of Islamic caliphate were expanded, and bay'a became common with caliphs, the issue of bay'a by the people of under-control lands was raised. People of these areas often pledged bay'a with local ruler on behalf of caliph. Changes in the Form Bay'a experienced some changes in form. Although the tradition of shaking or pressing hands still continued a long time, it was emphasized and guaranteed by Istihlaf (taking oath) in Umayyads age. Hajjaj b. Yusuf determined some particular oaths by the name of \"Ayman al-Bay'a\" to be taken at the time of bay'a and consisted of some oaths. According to Ibn Khaldun bay'a became royal and noble in later times. Even the tradition of shaking hands with caliph was eradicated except for some close people to him, since it was somehow considered a humiliation for caliph. Afterwards, bay'a was carried out in the form of kissing the ground, or the hand, or foot of the ruler. Ibn Khaldun thinks bay'a, in the form of this action in his era is fake. Al-Katani had talked about a kind of written bay'a common in his age, in which the person wrote a text denoting to conform to the ruler, or his testifying of the ruler's superiority was mentioned in that text. On the basis of historic texts, some special formalities and ceremonies were held to carry out bay'a with caliphs or rulers in different lands. Kalam and Fiqh Discourses The word bay'a became a political concept after Prophet's (s) demise. Even in view of some Sunnis, it turned into a political expression after the Event of Saqifa . Kalam and fiqh references of Sunnis have mentioned significant consequences for bay'a with ruler; however, hardly have they taken the nature of bay'a under question. In later fiqh sources, either Sunni or Shi'a fiqhs, there are various opinions about the legal nature of bay'a. The majority of them, regarding the literal meaning of bay'a and inspiring from its similarity with \"'Aqd al-Bay'\" (dealing contract), explain bay'a as an 'aqd (contract) containing a mutual commitment. In their viewpoint, this commitment requires the one who pledges bay'a to obey and follow the person, conform to his orders, and be loyal to him. Also, the mentioned commitment requires the one who receives bay'a to rule according to Qur'an and Sunna , to support the other side of commitment, to run the situation honestly and wisely and so on. Some scholars explain the meaning of bay'a in 10th verse of Sura al-Fath \"dealing the souls and pure selves in return for the heaven\". Thinking deeply about Prophet's bay'as, not only verifies bay'a has an 'aqd nature (means it establishes mutual duties), but also represents that in all of them no commitment was on Prophet's (s) shoulders in return for the commitment people took such as conforming to Islam, helping and obeying the Prophet (s), jihad with pagans and so on. Yet, mutual rights the two sides of bay'a have were discussed in a hadith. What is meant by the rights of the person pledging bay'a, supported by that hadith and Qur'an verses, is divine help and reward which actually are the consequences of conforming to the requirements of bay'a, not something which they do bay'a for. In Imam 'Ali (a)'s words, bay'a is considered as one of the ruler's rights towards people. Apparently, most researchers accordingly explained the concept of Bay'a as a pledge or giving obedience. Some of them think bay'a is not a mutual commitment and is similar to 'aqd al-hiba (gifting contract), and even some researchers believed it to be from iqa' (one-sided contract) subject. Some authors think bay'a is a one-side commitment, not mutual. Main Elements and Conditions Bay'a has three main elements, if its nature is 'aqd: the one who pledges bay'a, the one who receives bay'a, and the content of bay'a. Because of its 'aqd nature, the two sides must have required conditions like maturity, growth, and reason, as fiqh viewpoint states. However, bay'a for kids has been prescribed in some Sunni hadiths. In some hadiths, the ability of the person pledging bay'a is conditioned. One of the requirements which has been emphasized in fiqh sources is presence of option and lack of reluctance in each side of bay'a. Some Sunni sources consider bay'a with force or reluctance corrupted religiously, and alongside think it is legal and influential if some conditions are reached. Political Attitude of Sunnis Bay'a is one of the main controversial issues between Shi'a and Sunni. After bay'a was carried out for the important matter of Islamic succession and leadership in the Event of Saqifa , Sunni theologians attempted to justify theological foundations on the basis of this occurrence in later eras. This belief was discussed in their theological sources: Imamate is reachable through people's will and selection and through bay'a, or bay'a is the only way for a person to become Imam. Afterwards, the authors of Sunni political fiqh like al-Mawardi and Abu Ya'li al-Farra' considered Imamate as one of the \"Branches of Faith\" ( Furu' al-Din ) instead of \"Roots of Faith\" ( Usul al-Din ). They discussed conditions and consequences of bay'a on the basis of this theological point in their works. The majority of Sunni groups think bay'a of a group called \"Ahl al-hall wa l-'aqd\" is the requirement for someone to become caliph . Some of them like al-Ash'ari think the least number of people pledging bay'a for Imamate is one, some believe it to be two, some three, some five, and some of them 40 people. Some Sunnis state vaguely a group of \"Ahl al-hall wa l-'aqd\" is enough. Some faqihs of them believe caliphate is possible only through bay'a. A number of new and contemporary faqihs consider bay'a of all the people a main element for strengthening a caliphate in addition to the mentioned bay'a. They divided bay'a into three phases: nominating for caliphate, bay'at al-khassa (allegiance of nobles) and bay'at al-'amma (general allegianace). Al-Mawardi has mentioned preliminaries and phases of bay'a with more elaboration and details. New Political Attitude of Sunnis Most of Sunni faqihs and authors have tried to analyze bay'a so that it is an 'aqd with mutual commitment. They have attempted to make bay'a as equal as the theory of \"social contract\" by Rousseau, which is from basic rights foundations in democratic systems, trying to view it similar to the election and voting. If majority of people's give an allegiance with a ruler, it would be requisite for minorities, too. Seemingly, Muhammad 'Abduh has stated this viewpoint the first time. However, this theory has critics even among Sunnis. Political Attitude of Shi'a In Shi'a viewpoints, it is not plausible to do bay'a for every matter. Supposing bay'a is an 'aqd, its content must be legal and religious. For instance, Shi'a theologians consider the issue of Imamat or the succession of the Prophet (s) as something which cannot be proved by bay'a a group of people or all of them. According to many rational and narrative reasons, Imam must be determined through the Prophet (s) by God's order. In Shi'a faqihs viewpoints, using reasons of the necessity of being loyal to the commitment or condition like \"O you who have faith! Keep your agreements\" (Qur'an, 5:1) as the reasons of the necessity of being loyal to bay'a is possible. But these reasons are not able to legitimize the subject of 'aqd, but only signifies the necessity of being loyal to the conditions of the religious 'aqd. Also, in view of Shi'a scholars, the nature of bay'a in Prophet's (s) era, considering its literal meaning and the necessity to obey the Prophet (s), was not insha'i, but it had an emphatic aspect by rational and narrative reasons. In this sense, bay'a was used to emphasize faith to the Prophet (s) practically and to commit to the requirement of faith, and in some interpretations to create a new motivation for helping and obeying the Prophet (s). Therefore, the core of legitimacy (mashru'iyya) and proving the position of leadership for the Prophet (s), and even the obligation to obey him did not require bay'a. As this emphatic aspect of bay'a is obvious in bay'as with caliphs, particularly when caliphate was determined by former caliph in advance like 'Umar b. al-Khattab and 'Uthman b. 'Affan . This view of Sunnis either sourced from the tradition of bay'a with leader of the tribe before Islam, or is according to the claim to select all or some of the Prophet's (s) successors by bay'a. However, none of these two are supportive. Another problem Imami scholars find with it is presence of force and at least reluctance in most of Bay'a cases with caliphs by referring to real historical events, and even some Sunnis have accepted this. By considering many hadiths and historical reasons, after what happened in the Event of Saqifa , Imam 'Ali (a) , Banu Hashim , and some of great companions of the Prophet (s) did not pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr , and later did it reluctantly. Apart from this, one of the founders of this bay'a (i.e. 'Umar) thinks of it as a tactless task (falta) and did not approve of its repeat. Only in Imam 'Ali (a)'s age, optional bay'a was carried out. Even with too much insistence of his friends, 'Ali (a) did not accept bay'a with force. According to historical sources, limited number of people did not pledge allegiance, without being deprived of social rights or violated. Some Sunni authors, supporting their claims by some speeches or letters in Nahj al-balagha , in which it talked about the requisite of bay'a even for those who had not pledged bay'a, have claimed that Imam 'Ali (a) and Imam al-Hasan (a) had approved of proving Imamate by bay'a. But Shi'a researchers have rejected this opinion, since not only disagreeing with proving Imamate with bay'a is one of requirements of Shi'a theology, but also it was emphasized by Imam 'Ali (a) himself. Because of this and other reasons, we should apply these hadiths in order to make the opponent silent and persuaded, when debates and squabbles. New Political Attitude of Shi'a Although most of Imami contemporary faqihs state only an emphatic role for bay'a in presence of Imam, some of them state a role that is further than emphasis for bay'a to faqihs in the absence of Imam, meaning they state a kind of insha' (having neither good aspect nor bad). However, some faqihs do not differentiate between bay'a in presence of Imam and his absence. Moreover, some contemporary faqihs believe to achieve a kind of wilaya (superiority) and democratic legitimacy through Bay'a in the Age of Occultation . A limited number of these faqih think of bay'a as an \"'aqd al-wikala al-lazim\" (obligatory contract of advocacy) which its subject is inshai' for wilaya and giving control over others. Accordingly, will and bay'a of majority is must-done in comparison with those minorities who did not pledged bay'a. Explaining bay'a as 'aqd al-wikala and also the obligation of this kind of 'aqd is discussed and debated continuously. Notes References"}
{"title": "Chieftains of Banu Israel", "text": "Chieftains of Banu Israel or Nuqabā of Banū Israel (Arabic: نقباء بني إسرائیل ) were from the twelve Asbat (tribes) of Banu Israel , i.e. children of Banu Israel. Prophet Moses (a) delivered the order of God and one representative was chosen from each of Asbat for their own tribes. In the Qur'an 5 :12, this issue is mentioned without details. Chieftains were among great people of their tribe and their duty was to guard the covenant, Banu Israel was entrusted by God; however, most exegetes believe that besides this duty, they had the task of collecting information about a tyrant nation in order to immigrate to Jerusalem as well. In both Shi'a and Sunni sources, there are hadiths from the Prophet (s) in which he (s) considered the number of his vicegerents the same as the number of the leaders of Banu Israel. Representatives of the Prophet Moses (a) The word \"nuqaba\" is the plural form of the word \"naqib\" meaning \"knowledgeable and aware of secrets\". But, \"guardianship and trust-keeping\" too can be found in the meaning of naqib. In verse twelve of the Qur'an 5, it is mentioned that God chose twelve leaders among Banu Israel. According to exegetes, nuqaba were from the twelve Asbat (tribes) of Banu Israel, from each of which one representative was chosen. Leaders of Banu Israel were messengers of Prophet Moses (a) among their own tribes. According to some hadiths, they were chosen by the Prophet Moses (a) following the order of God. Positions In the Qur'an, the position of Chieftains (nuqaba) is not clearly mentioned. Therefore, it has led to the proposition of different ideas in this regard. In the Qur'an, it is only mentioned that they were ordered to guard the covenant, Banu Israel was entrusted by God. However, it is certain that Chieftains (nuqaba) were leaders of their tribes and had an influential opinion and special positions. In some exegetical books, Chieftains are considered elites of their tribes, commanders and even kings. Some believe that they were later chosen as prophets . Some others considered higher positions for them and said that they received divine books and were considered to have higher positions than ordinary prophets, but they were below Ulu l-'Azm prophets in ranks. Duties The most important duty Moses (a) entrusted his representatives aka \"nuqaba\" with, after the covenant of Banu Israel was during their journey to Jerusalem . They were ordered to collect information about a tyrant nation who lived in Canaan , Levant or Ariha (Jericho) in Palestine , sometimes called Amalek . After recording their observations, they went to Moses (a) and spoke about the grandeur of the residents of those regions, about which extraordinary stories are also told. Although Moses (a) prohibited them from spreading this information and frightening their people, except two or five of them, others disobeyed the order of Moses (a), went to their people and did what they were prohibited from. Names In his commentary, al-Tha'labi , an exegete of the Qur'an mentioned the names of the leaders as below: 1. Shamil b. Ran 2. Shaqat b. Hori 3. Caleb b. Jephunneh 4. Maqail b. Yusuf 5. Joshua b. Nun 6. Qantum b. Arqun 7. Madi b. Adi 8. Jadi b. Qamin 9. Bianun b. Mulkia 10. Naftali Mahar b. Vaqsi 11. Hama'il b. Haml 12. Sabur b. Mulkia The names of leaders are mentioned in other sources with little difference. Likening the Prophet's (s) Vicegerents to the Leaders of Banu Israel In many hadiths, the Prophet (s) mentioned that the number of his vicegerents would be the same as the number of Chieftains of Banu Israel. These hadiths can be considered beside other hadiths of Sunnis in the collection of Hadith of Twelve Caliphs which considered the number of the Prophet's (s) vicegerents twelve individuals, all of whom would be from Quraysh . Some researchers believe that this issue was more focused by Sunnis during the times of Imams (a) and was less focused by Shi'a hadith scholars. According to another hadith, the Prophet (s) considered the destiny of his people similar to that of Banu Israel. . Also, during the al-Aqaba allegiance , the Prophet (s) chose twelve naqibs (leaders) from among the Helpers to be his representatives in Medina . In Tafsir al-Mizan , Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i likened Chieftains (Nuqaba) to Ulu l-Amr in Islam and considered them the authorities of Banu Israel in religious and worldly affairs.

{"title": "Muftarad al-Ta'a", "text": "Muftaraḍ al-Ṭāʿa (Arabic: مُفْتَرَضُ الطاعَة ), a special status for the Imams of the Shi'a (a) , means someone towards whom full and unconditional obedience is compulsory . Citing some Qur'anic verses and Hadiths , like Ulu l-Amr verse , Hadith al-Thaqalayn , Hadith al-Safina and Hadith al-Manzila , Shi'a scholars consider Shi'a Imams (a) as Individuals whose obedience is obligatory. Some of the scholars, like al-Shaykh al-Tusi , argues for this status for the Commander of the faithful (a) , and then takes it as the basis to argue for his Imamate . In addition to the abovementioned Hadiths, there are accounts in Shi'a Hadith sources that explicitly designate this title for the Imams (a). In al-Kafi , seventeenth Hadiths have been narrated in a specific chapter dedicated to this title. However, in some accounts the Imams (a) have not recognized themselves as Muftarad al-Ta'a; and given the apparent conflict between two groups of Hadith, Shi'a scholars have not accepted the latter. Some researchers suggest these accounts have been issued in the context of Taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation). Concept Muftarad al-Ta'a is title given to someone towards whom full and unconditional obedience is compulsory. Shi'a scholars consider it as a unique and special status for Imams (a). Al-Allama al-Majlisi regards being Muftarad al-Ta'a as one of requisite for the state of Imamate and believes the Hadith al-Manzila proves this point. Some also have stated that the meaning of Imamate and divine vicegerency is essentially this very state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a. Arguments for Imams’ status as Muftarad al-Ta'a Basing their argument on different Qur'anic verses and Hadiths, Shi'a scholars considers Imams (a) as those towards whom obedience is obligatory. The verse of Ulu l-Amr , Hadith of al-Thaqalayn, Hadith al-Safina and Hadith al-Manzila are among the Qur'anic verses and Hadiths through which the state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) can be demonstrated. Additionally, there are some Hadith accounts that directly and explicitly mention the title Muftarad al-Ta'a for the Imams (a): The Verse of Ulu l-Amr According to the verse \"Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those who hold command from among you.\" The obedience to Ulu l-Amr (those who hold command) -along with and like the obedience to Allah and His Apostle- has been regarded as an absolute and unconditional obligation. As 'Allama Tabataba'i states, immediate conjunction of Ulu l-Amr to the Apostle without independently repeating the verb \"obey\", shows that like the obedience to the Apostle, the obedience to Ulu l-Amr is unconditionally obligatory. Based on exegetical Hadiths, Shi'a scholars take Ulu l-Amr as a reference to Twelve Imams (a) . Implicit mention of Muftarad al-Ta'a in Hadiths In Hadith al-Thaqalayn , Ahl al-Bayt (a) have been conjoined together. As following the holey Qur'an is obligatory upon Muslims , obedience to Ahl al-Bayt (a) is likewise obligatory. According to Abu al-Salah al-Halabi , Shi'a jurist and theologian in fourth/fifth or tenth/eleventh century, the unrestricted verbal expression in the prophetic Hadith of al-Thaqalayn, proves the unrestricted and unconditional obligation in following the Ahl al-Bayt (a). Therefore, Muslims should follow the Ahl al-Bayt (a) in all of their verbal and practical teachings. Also, Hadith al-Safina proves the obligation of obedience and and following the Ahl al-Bayt (a); because, based on the content of this Hadith, salvation is achieved by following them and perdition and misguidance are the results of disobeying them. As Mir Hamid Husayn states, based on this Hadith, obedience to Ahl al-Bayt (a) is absolutely and unconditionally compulsory. Some of the scholars, like al-Shaykh al-Tusi and Abu al-Salah al-Halabi argue for the state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imam Ali (a) through the Hadith al-Manzila and from there, demonstrates his Imamate. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi writes: in Hadith al-Manzila, the Prophet (s) introduces the relation of Imam Ali (a) to himself like that of Harun (a) to Moses (a) . Since Harun was Muftarad al-Ta'a because of his vicegerency from Moses (a), Imam 'Ali (a) too is Muftarad al-Ta'a and this very status proves his Imamate as well. Explicit mention of Muftarad al-Ta'a in Hadiths There are accounts in Hadith sources that explicitly state that the Imams (a) are Muftarad al-Ta'a. In al-Kafi and under the chapter entitled \"The Chapter on the Obligation of Obedience to the Imams\" al-Kulayni has documented seventeenth Hadith in this regard. In one of these Hadiths, Imam al-Sadiq (a) testifies to the status of Muftarad al-Ta'a for his previous Imams (a) and introduces them as Imams (a), whose obedience Allah has made compulsory. In another Hadith, Imam al-Sadiq (a) swears that there is no status on earth, higher than being Muftarad al-Ta'a, and even though Prophet Ibrahim (a) had been receiving divine revelation for a long time, he had not been Muftarad al-Ta'a until Allah appointed him as an Imam. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi in Bihar al-Anwar has narrated from Imam al-Rida (a) that this status (for Imams) had been announced to Muslims during the lifetime of the Prophet (s) and the covenant was confirmed on the day of Ghadir . Additionally, there are accounts in Hadith sources that different individuals in different occasions, testify to the Imams’ state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a in their presence and the Imams (a) receive their testimony. Apposite Hadiths In Shi'a Hadith sources, accounts can be found where Imams (a) of the Shi'a have denied their being Muftarad al-Ta'a. One such Hadith has been narrated by al-Shaykh al-Tusi . In this Hadith, two individuals come to Imam al-Sadiq (a) and one of them asks him: \"is the Muftarad al-Ta'a leader from among you?\" and Imam (a) replies: \"I don't know such a person among us.\" Then that individual continues: \"some people in Kufa believe that the Muftarad al-Ta'a leader is from among you.\" Imam (a) says: \"we have not ordered them to do this.\" Also, in his book al-Ikhtisas , al-Shaykh al-Mufid has narrated a Hadith in which Imam al-Kazim (a) regards the belief in the status of Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) as one of the Ghali (exaggerators') beliefs and rejects it. Opinion of Shi'a sholars about opposite Hadiths Shia scholars do not accept the Hadiths against the status of Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) and believe that Imams (a) of the Shi'a are Muftarad al-Ta'a. Al-Shaykh al-Saduq , al-Shaykh al-Mufid and al-Shaykh al-Tusi believe that as per the content of Hadith al-Manzila , Imams (a) are Muftarad al-Ta'a. Some researchers state that the Hadiths in which the Imams (a) have negated the state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a form themselves have been issued in the context of Taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation). According to this viewpoint, during the time of Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Kazim (a) the belief in the state of Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) had gained prevalence which, subsequently, raised the sensitivity of Abbasid caliphs , for they would clearly see this belief as a threat to their totalitarian political authority.

{"title": "Imamate of the Twelve Imams (a)", "text": "Imāmate of the Twelve Imāms (a) (Arabic: إمامة الأئمة الاثني عشر ) refers to divine guardianship and special wilaya of the twelve successors of the Seal of the Prophets (s) . According to Twelver Shi'a teachings, twelve infallible ones among the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) have guardianship and imamate over others and they are appointed to this position by God . Thus, the Twelver Shi'a are also called Ithna 'Ashari Shi'a . The names of the Twelve Imams, in order of their imamate, are: Ali (a) , al-Hasan (a) , al-Husayn (a) , Ali (a) , Muhammad (a) , Ja'far (a) , Musa (a) , Ali (a) , Muhammad (a) , Ali (a) , al-Hasan (a) , and Muhammad (a) . Proofs for Imamate can be categorized into two groups: hadiths , and Imams' (a) qualities. First Proof: Hadiths of the Twelve Caliphs One of the proofs for the imamate of the twelve Imams (a) is the hadiths in which the number of the Prophet's (s) caliphs are restricted to twelve people, all of whom are from Quraysh . In addition to Shi'a references, these hadiths are also mentioned in Sunni references such as Sahih Muslim , Sahih Ibn Hibban , Jami' al-Tirmidhi , Sunan Ibn Dawud , Sunan Ibn Maja , Musnad Ibn Hanbal , Musnad Ibn Ja'd , Musnad Abu Ya'la , Kanz al-'ummal . In some of these hadiths, the Prophet (s) mentioned these twelve persons as \"Ithna 'Ashar Khalifa\" [the Twelve caliphs] such as the hadith, \"After me, there will be twelve caliphs who are from Quraysh\"; or saying \"this religion will be powerful and invincible as long as twelve caliphs rule it.\" And \"Islam will be standing until twelve caliphs rule, who are all from Quraysh\" and other such hadiths. In some hadiths, the Prophet (s) called imams after him as \"Ithna 'Ashar Amiran\" [the Twelve Emirs]. In some other hadiths, the number of the Prophet's (s) caliphs are considered the same as the Chieftains of Banu Israel after Moses (a) , such as in, \"the number of caliphs after me is the same as the number of the chiefs of Banu Isra'il\" and that \"the caliphs after me are twelve the same as the number of the chiefs of Banu Isra'il.\" Some Sunni researchers have said that twelve people from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are meant by the twelve people mentioned in hadiths because the people in these hadiths cannot be matched with other people, neither with the caliphs after the Prophet (s) , since they are less than twelve people, nor with Umayyad rulers, since they were more than twelve. Moreover, Umayyad rulers were very tyrant and they were not Hashemite . The twelve people mentioned in hadiths cannot be matched with Abbasid caliphs either since they were more than twelve. Therefore, inevitably, these hadiths from the Prophet (s) would only match the twelve Imams (a) from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s), because they were superior to others in knowledge, dignity, God-wariness, and lineage. Hadith al-Thaqalayn and similar hadiths are proofs for the fact that by the twelve imams, the Prophet (s) actually meant twelve people of his Ahl al-Bayt (a). Second Proof: Hadiths Containing the Names of Imams (a) The second type of hadiths includes those in which the Prophet (s) has mentioned the number of his caliphs as twelve, introduced them, and said that they are from his Ahl al-Bayt (a). These hadiths are in some groups: 1. In the first group of such hadiths, Imam 'Ali (a) is mentioned as the first Imam and Imam al-Mahdi (a) as the last Imam, such as in, \"The Imams after me are twelve; first one of whom is 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and the last one is the Upriser (al-Qa'im). Obeying them is obeying me and disobeying them is disobeying me. Anyone who denies them has denied me.\" Elsewhere, he (s) said, \"The Imams after me are twelve; the first one of whom is 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and their last one is the Upriser (a) (al-Qa'im). They are my successors and caliphs, and friends and divine proofs over my people after me. Those who acknowledge their imamate is a believer and those who deny them are disbelievers .\" 2. The second group of hadiths are those in which the Prophet (s) has mentioned nine Imams after himself from the progeny of Imam al-Husayn (a) , the last one of whom is the Upriser (a) (al-Qa'im). Abu Dharr narrated from the Prophet (s) that, \"Imams (a) after me are twelve; nine of whom are from the progeny of Imam al-Husayn (a) and the ninth of whom is their Upriser (a) (al-Qa'im). Beware that the Twelve Imams (a) among you are like the Arc of Noah (a) , anyone who boards it will survive and anyone who does not board it will perish.\" 3. In another group of hadiths, the Prophet (s) only mentions the common names among Imams (a) such as, \"Imams (a) after me are twelve, first one of whom is Ali (a), the fourth of whom is 'Ali (a), the eighth of whom is 'Ali (a), the tenth of whom is 'Ali (a), and their last one is al-Mahdi .\" Or the hadith saying that \"Imams after me are twelve persons of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the first of whom is 'Ali (a) and the middle one of whom is Muhammad (a) and the last one of whom is Muhammad (a), and he (a) is the al-Mahdi of my people, whom Jesus (a) , son of Mary (a) , will follow in prayer.\" 4. In the final group of hadiths, the Prophet (s) introduced the Twelve Imams (a) with their names and titles in full. In a hadith known as the hadith al-Lawh , the names of the Twelve Imams (a) are mentioned with their special descriptions. Third Proof: Infallibility The third proof of the imamate of Imams (a) is their infallibility . In some hadiths, Imams (a) of Ahl al-Bayt (a) are mentioned as having the merit of infallibility. These hadiths, in fact refer to the rational argument for the imamate of Imams (a) of the Ahl al-Bayt (a); since, from a rational point of view, Imam (a) is required to be infallible and because no one except Imams (a) have been infallible among the people, then their imamate is proven. Fourth Proof: Superiority Another proof for the imamate of the Twelve Imams (a) is their superiority in moral virtues; it can be explained that having superiority in perfections and unique qualities such as knowledge , infallibility , etc. over others, Imams (a) of Shi'a deserve to take the position of imamate and leadership of people. It is obvious that with their presence, prioritizing others for imamate is rationally unwise and wrong. Besides many hadiths that allude to the superiority of Imams (s), the philosophy of imamate requires that due to the significance of the mission imam has about the guidance and leadership of people in religion and worldly matters, imam should be superior and most competent of all people so that they consider him as a role model in all perfections and follow him. This requires the purity of Imam and his possession of the noblest of human manners and merits. From this point of view, any one of the Twelve Imams (a) of the Shi'a have been so perfect in their time that anyone has acknowledged the greatness of their character, and even those who debated or argued with them would express humbleness against their scientific and spiritual grandeur. Fifth Proof: Miracles Another proof for the imamate of the Twelve Imams (a) of the Shi'a is the miracles and wonders they (a) made. Making such miracles have been of the following types: They (a) sometimes foretold about the future, and they would happen exactly the way Imams (a) had foretold. They (a) sometimes explained facts from the unseen world , no one would ever be able to learn through normal ways. They (a) sometimes showed some knowledge in their childhood in a manner that everyone would feel humble before them. They (a) sometimes showed a spiritual power over the creation such as, Hajar al-Aswad 's speaking by order of Imam al-Sajjad (a) and acknowledging the Imamate of Imam al-Sajjad (a). [22] Production of dates by a dried palm tree by order of Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba (a) . [23] Imam al-Baqir's (a) giving full eyesight to Abu Basir and then turning him back to the way he was before, out of Abu Basir's own request. [24] And many more acts of wonder reported from Imams (a) and mentioned in authentic historical and hadith references such as al-Kafi , Ibn Shahr Ashub 's al-Manaqib , al-Mas'udi 's Ithbat al-wasiyya , al-Tabari 's Dala'il al-imama , etc. Making such acts of wonder by the infallible Imams (a) which has been accompanied with the claim of Imamate is a proof for their Imamate, the same way the Prophet's (s) miracles were a definite proof for the validity of their claim of prophethood .

{"title": "Principle of Lutf", "text": "The principle of lutf (Arabic: قاعدة اللطف , literally: divine grace) is a principle in theology to the effect that God should do things by which the duty-bound person becomes close to obedience of God and avoids sins , without this divine grace having an impact on the person’s power or making the action compulsory . The majority of Mu'tazilite and Imami theologians have endorsed the principle, while Ash'arite theologians have rejected it. Imami theologians draw upon the principle in providing rational proofs for many Islamic beliefs, such as the requirement that God should legislate religious duties, send prophets , appoint Imams , and the like. Some Imami jurists have deployed the principle to establish the validity of consensus . Notion The principle of lutf (or divine grace) states that God should do everything that helps people become close to obedience of God or avoid sins, such as legislation of religious duties and sending the prophets , through which people are introduced to their religious obligations. In Islamic theology, being latif (graceful) is divine attribute of action, which means that He does things by which the duty-bound person becomes close to obedience of God and avoids sins, without the grace having an impact on the person’s power or making the action compulsory. In Quranic verses and hadiths , God's gracefulness has other meanings as well , including God's penetrating knowledge, the impossibility of perceiving God and rejection of His corporeality, God's innermost essence being incomprehensible, the subtlety of divine creation and plans, and benefaction and generosity. Kinds of Lutf In the literature, there are two kinds of divine grace (or lutf): muhassil (obtaining) and muqarrib (closeness). Muhassil grace is what should be done in order for the obedience of God to obtain; that is, without it, one cannot serve God, while muqarrib grace just brings the person close to obedience of God. Proponents and Opponents Muslim theologians disagree over the principle of lutf. Mu'tazilite and Imami theologians endorse the principle of lutf by adducing rational and textual evidence, while Ash'arite theologians oppose the principle, raise objections against it, and believe that God is not required to do any grace. Rational Evidence for the Principle of Lutf Rational evidence for the principle of divine grace is grounded in God’s attribute of wisdom. The argument is that a wise person does not defeat his own purposes; that is, he does not do something that contradicts his goals. Accordingly, if God wants humans to obey Him, He should prepare the ground for such obedience. The argument runs as follows: God is all-wise. A wise person does not defeat his purpose. God wants people to obey Him. People’s obedience of God is impossible without divine grace (lutf). To charge people with obligations without any grace defeats the purposes. Therefore, grace is required for God. [12] The Ash'arite Objection Ash'arite theologians believe that the requirement of grace for God implies that God is governed by reason, while God is the absolute governor who is not governed by anything else. Proponents of the principle of grace reply by saying that the requirement of lutf does not mean that God has the duty to have grace. Rather, it is to say that human reason grasps the necessity of grace on the part of God by inferring from God's own attributes, such as knowledge , wisdom , and justice . Theological Functions The principle of lutf (or divine grace) has a variety of instances and functions in Islamic theology. Advocates of the principle take the following as instances of the principle: Legislation of religious duties: religious duties (such as the prohibition of injustice and obligation of the prayer) count as instances of lutf or divine grace in that they bring people close to compliance with their rational duties (such as badness of injustice or goodness of gratitude toward God). Sending the prophets: it is necessary for God to send prophets as a matter of His grace over people, since it is through the prophets that people can have access to their religious duties and come close to the accomplishment of their rational duties and the goals of the creation. Infallibility of the prophets: people would tend to avoid the prophets if they saw any sins and misdeeds done by the prophets. However, with their infallibility and purity, they come close to their obedience. Appointment of an infallible Imam: Imami theologians agree that it is necessary for God to appoint an infallible Imam, since it would bring them close to obedience of God and avoidance of sins. Promise of divine rewards and punishments: it is necessary for God to promise rewards and punishments for actions, since it is in this way that people tend to be led to good characters and compliance with religious duties. [15] Appointment of a jurist guardian (al-wali al-faqih): according to Imam Khomeini and 'Abd Allah Jawadi Amuli , a Shiite theologian and jurist, God's wisdom and grace demand that people should not be deprived of the guardianship of competent people in the period of Occultation . For this reason, in this period, He has appointed qualified jurists as deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and guardians of the Islamic community. [16] Application in the Principles of Jurisprudence A number of scholars in the principles of jurisprudence , including al-Sayyid al-Murtada , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , and al-Karajuki , have made recourse to the principle of lutf to establish the validity of consensus (ijmaʿ). They argue that if scholars agree over a false ruling, then the Infallible Imam has the duty to prevent the consensus out of the grace, and when there is no view against the consensus, it becomes evident that the Infallible Imam agrees with the ruling. Accordingly, consensus over a ruling implies the Infallible Imam’s agreement. Nevertheless, some scholars, including al-Shaykh al-Ansari , Muhammad Husayn al-Na'ini , and Akhund Khurasani , reject the argument. Bibliography In addition to works of theology and principles of jurisprudence, the principle of lutf is discussed independently as well, including in the following: Barrasi-yi tatbiqi-yi qaʿida-yi lutf dar imamiyya wa-amuza-yi fayd dar masihiyyat-i catolic (A comparative study of the principle of grace in the Imamiyya and the doctrine of grace in Catholic Christianity) by Hasan Dinpanah. The author concludes that although both lutf in the Imamiyya and grace in Christianity lead to people’s avoidance of sins and to their salvation , but they are fundamentally different in their principles and presuppositions. The book was published in 2017 by Imam Khomeini Education and Research Institute in 370 pages. Qa'ida-yi lutf wa-ithbat-i wujūd-i Imam-i hayy (The principle of lutf and a proof for the existence of a living Imam) by Mahdi Yusufiyan. The book addresses the principle of lutf and its functions in proving the existence of an Imam and Imamate . It was published in 2016 by the publications of the Center of Mahdawiyya affiliated by the Seminary of Qom in 210 pages.

{"title": "Superiority of the Ahl al-Bayt (a)", "text": "Shi'as believe that Ahl al-Bayt (a) who have superiority regarding perfections and unique qualities such as knowledge , infallibility , etc. over others, deserve to take the position of imamate and leadership of people. It is obvious that with their presence, prioritizing others for imamate is rationally unwise and wrong. Argument Based on Their Position of Imamate God has appointed Ahl al-Bayt (a) as the leader ( Imam ) of other people and has ordered people to obey them. Due to the significance of mission imam has about the guidance and leadership of people in religion and worldly matters, imam should be superior and most competent of all people so that they know him an exemplar in all perfections and follow him. This requires the purity of imam and his possession of most noble of human manners and merits. In this regard everyone of the Twelve Imams (a) of Shi'a have been the most perfect person of their time to extend that the greatness of their character has been acknowledged by anyone and even those who debated or argued with them would express humbleness against their scientific and spiritual grandeur. In the Hadith al-Thaqalayn From the hadith al-Thaqalayn, superiority of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) over others can easily be understood, because the Prophet (s) put them beside the Qur'an , called the Qur'an as \"al-Thiql al-Akbar\" (the greater weight) and Ahl al-Bayt (a) as al-Thiql al-Asghar (the smaller weight) and never put another person beside the Qur'an. Therefore, the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are superior to others the same way as the noble Qur'an is superior over Muslims. Accordingly, Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani has said, \"the message of the verse al-Tathir and Hadith al-Thaqalayn is the superiority of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) over others and the reason of their superiority is not only because of their relation with the Prophet (s), because according to the Qur'an, tradition and consensus, the criterion of superiority is knowledge and taqwa (godwariness) which Ahl al-Bayt (a) have and this can be understood from their equal position with the Qur'an and the necessity of adhering to them, since adhering to the Qur'an is not possible except through acting upon one's knowledge and the guidance of the Qur'an. The same is true about adhering to the Ahl al-Bayt (a). In the al-Mubahala Verse The al-Mubahala verse implies the superiority of Ahl al-Bayt over other companions of the Prophet (s); since, according to this verse, God has given the Prophet (s) mission to choose some people from among children, Muslim men and women to accompany him in Mubahala with the Christians of Najran ; and the Prophet (s) chose 'Ali (a) , Lady Fatima (a) and al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) . There is no doubt that those are chosen for Mubahala who have great position in faith and closeness to God; and in a Mubahala, one of the participants is the Prophet (s), those need to accompany him who are either similar in position with him or closer to him than others regarding position. On the other hand, if there was some other Muslims who had such a high position in faith, the Prophet (s) would take him with himself as well, because there is not slightest possibility of injustice or unwise action about the actions of the Prophet (s). Abu Riyah, the servant of Umm Salama narrated from the Prophet (s) that, \"if there were other people more honorable than 'Ali (a), Fatima (s), al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a), God would order me to do Mubahala with their help.\" In Other Hadiths and Verses Superiority of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) can also be understood from other hadiths and verses such as the al-Mawadda verse (Qur'an 42:23), hadith al-Safina , hadith Bab Hitta , hadith al-Nujum , etc. Admittance of Great Sunni Scholars Sunni scholars and noble ones have also admitted to the superiority of Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . These admittances are two types: some imply the superiority of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) in general and some express the superiority of each of Imams (a) of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) over others. Here some examples are followed, About the superiority and position of the Ahl al-Bayt (a), Ibn al-'Arabi says, \"no creature in creation is created with the same position of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s). They deserve leadership and masterhood. Having enmity with them is true loss and their love is true worship.\" The Sunni scholar 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad al-Shabrawi says that, \"Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) had all the merits together. Anyone who wants to hide their merits, it would be as if he wants to cover the light of the sun! No one asked them question, except he heard a sufficient and rational answer [from them] and no one debated them but he was defeated.\" Al-Shafi'i , the leader of Shafiites addressed the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) saying, \"O the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s)! God has mentioned your love obligatory in the Qur'an and about your merits, it would be sufficient to say that reciting salawat [praise] on you has been regarded as the condition for accepting the prayer.\" Regarding the great personality of Imam 'Ali (a) , Muhammad Husayn al-Dhahabi, the lecturer at al-Azhar University and the author of the famous book al-Tafsir wa l-mufassirun says, \"'Ali (a) was the endless sea of knowledge. He (a) possessed a great power of reasoning and unparalleled eloquence. He (a) had the perfect intellect and effective insight so that in many issues, the Companions of the Prophet would refer to him for solving problems and understanding scientific and religious issues and asked that refuge and authority for help in solving problems.\" In his al-Fusul al-muhimma , Ibn Sabbagh al-Maliki (d. 855/1451-2) says, \"'Ali (a) knew fully about the permissible ( halal ) and the forbidden ( haram ) and knew about complex rulings and the truth of matters; he (a) clearly knew every rule in its own place.\" Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhri (d. 124/741-2) was a scholar among the followers ( Tabi'un ) who had the knowledge of the seven Sunni scholars in mind. About the knowledge of Imam al-Sajjad (a) he said, \"I never saw anyone more knowledgeable than Zayn al-'Abidin (a) .\" 'Abd Allah b. 'Ata who was a great scholar contemporary with Imam al-Baqir (a) who describes the knowledge of Imam (a) as, \"I have never seen scholars more humble before anyone than before Abu Ja'far (a). I saw a great scholar like al-Hakam b. 'Utayba having all scholarly merits among people before Abu Ja'far (a) like a young leaner who respectfully sat before his teacher.\" When Abu Hanifa , one of the imams of the Four Sunni schools, was asked about the most knowledgeable person of the time, he answered, \"I have never seen any scholar more knowledgeable than Ja'far b. Muhammad al-Sadiq (a) .\" Malik b. Anas (d. 174/790-1), the leader of Maliki school said, \"No eye has seen, no ear has heard and no heart has ever believed that anyone would be more superior than Ja'far b. Muhammad al-Sadiq (a) in knowledge, worshiping and God-wariness.\" Abu 'Uthman 'Umar b. Bahr (d. 255/868-9) said, \"Ja'far b. Muhammad (a) is the one who filled the world with his knowledge and people like Abu Hanifa and Sufyan al-Thuri and others were honored to have been his students.\" There are many more acknowledgements made by noble Sunni scholars about dignity and great position of the Imams (a) of Shi'a.

{"title": "Al-Ghadir Sermon", "text": "Al-Ghadīr Sermon (Arabic: خطبة الغدير ) is a sermon delivered by the Prophet (s) where he (s) proclaimed 'Ali (a) as the Wali (guardian) of Muslims. The Prophet (s) delivered this sermon on 18th of Dhu l-Hijja of 10 / March 16 , 632) on his return from Hajjat al-Wida' (Farewell Hajj) in a place called Ghadir Khumm . Many Shi'a and Sunni scholars have narrated this sermon. Sermon of Al-Ghadir is one of the proofs Shi'a bring for the guardianship of Imam 'Ali (a) after the Prophet (s). Shi'a also support their claim with other proofs and evidences. The Hadith al-Ghadir is a part of this sermon where the Prophet (s) says, \"Anyone I am his master (Wali), then 'Ali (a) is his master.\" Since, this phrase is narrated by more than 110 companions of the Prophet (s) and 84 Followers , it can be said that this hadith has been narrated as mutawatir (frequent). 'Abd al-Husayn Amini collected all the references for this sermon and the Hadith al-Ghadir from Sunni sources and published them together with all other supportive reasons for the event of Ghadir in 11 volumes in his book al-Ghadir . Event of al-Ghadir In 10 /632, the Prophet (s) decided to go to Hajj . This Hajj was made in the last year of his life which was later called Hajjat al-Wida' (Farewell Hajj). People were informed of the Prophet's (s) decision so that they could prepare to go on this journey. Many Muslims gathered in Medina to accompany the Prophet (s) for Hajj. He exited Medina for Mecca on Dhu l-Qa'da 25th. Since Ramadan of that year, Imam Ali (a) had gone to Madhhij in Yemen to battle with the disbelievers. After he (a) gained victory and collected the booties , the Prophet (s) ordered him to join him in Mecca to perform Hajj. On the Day of 'Arafa , the Prophet (s) delivered a sermon to the pilgrims of Hajj and reminded them of important issues including the importance of a Muslims' blood and property, trust-keeping, prohibition of usury , the rights of women, and prohibiting people from following Satan . After completing the rituals of Hajj, the Muslims exited Mecca and to return to their own states. On the 18th of Dhu l-Hijja , the caravan of the pilgrims arrived in Ghadir Khumm , between Mecca and Medina, 5 km away from Juhfa where different routes separate from each other. When the caravan arrived there, Jabra'il (Gabriel) revealed verses of 67 of the Qur'an 5 to the Prophet (s) and delivered him God 's order to announce Wilaya (guardianship) of 'Ali (a) to all people. The caravan was stopped by the order of the Prophet (s) and those who were behind joined them. After the noon prayer , a pulpit was made and the Prophet (s) delivered a sermon in which he (s) told people that he (s) would soon depart them. He mentioned two precious things he would leave and trust people with and spoke about his Wilaya and priority over believers. Then, he (s) raised 'Ali's (a) hand and said, \"Anyone I am his master (Wali), then this 'Ali (a) is his master.\" Then he (s) made du'as for 'Ali's (a) friends and cursed his enemies. At that point, Hassan b. Thabit asked for permission and composed a poem about that event. Then 'Umar b. al-Khattab congratulated 'Ali (a) for his position. Key Points At the beginning of the sermon, the Prophet (s) praised God and for some minutes eloquently described God's attributes for the people, Mentioning God's order for announcing something important and the revelation of the Tabligh Verse , The Prophet's (s) asking God to dispense him with that announcement due to his fear for the mischiefs of hypocrites and several comings of Jabra'il (Gabriel) for repeating God's order and promising the Prophet (s) that he (s) would be kept safe from the mischief of people, Announcing that it was his last attendance in such a gathering of people and that Imamate of the Ummah would be upon 'Ali (a) and his descendants until the Judgment Day , Saying that things the Prophet (s) mentioned as forbidden and things he (s) mentioned as permissible will remain so until the Judgment Day, Mentioning the levels of 'Ali's (a) knowledge and merits, Saying that denying Wilaya of 'Ali (a) would be an unforgivable sin forever, Mentioning that anyone who questions the Prophet's (s) speech or any of Imams (a) would be just the same as disbelievers at the age of pre-Islam Ignorance , Saying the historical statement of \"whoever I am his master (Wali), then this 'Ali (a) is his master\", Repeating the Hadith al-Thaqalayn and mentioning the positions of the Qur'an and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) beside each other, Emphasizing the succession and caliphate of 'Ali (a), Making prayer for the friends of Imam 'Ali (a) and cursing his enemies, \"O God, befriend his friends and be the enemy of his enemies\", Coming of Jabra'il (Gabriel) and announcing the perfection of religion (a part of verse 3 of Qur'an ), Emphasizing on the position of Imamate and heeding people not to envy Imam, Mentioning the mischief of hypocrites, Mentioning the end of Imamate with the Rising al-Mahdi (a) , a descendant of Imam 'Ali (a), Prohibiting people from following false Imams in future, Ordering the audience to deliver the message of his speech in Ghadir Khum to others who were absent, Enjoining people to friendship with the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and enmity with their enemies, Mentioning about 20 sentences about Imam al-Mahdi (a) and his government, Saying that the best of the good is to understand the Prophet's (s) word and to deliver it to others, Mentioning other merits of Imam 'Ali (a) and ordering people to officially give allegiance to him as the Imam and successor of the Prophet (s), References This sermon in its complete form as mentioned above has been narrated in different ways in Shi'a historical and hadith references during centuries.

Jubayr al-Asadi Safi al-Din al-Hilli Research Sources for References of the al-Ghadir Sermon Criticisms about the References Some have tried to cast doubts about this historical event including the following: Weakness of the References Despite the frequency of narration, multitude of references, and the many chains through which this hadith has been narrated, some Sunni scholars believe that this hadith cannot be regarded as Mutawatir (frequent) and Sahih (authentic). Their justification is that most hadith narrators such as al-Bukhari and Muslim al-Nisaburi have not narrated it and some others including Abi Dawud and Abi Hatam al-Razi have considered it weak. Their doubt has been answered by many Sunni scholars such as al-Tirmidhi (d. 279 /892-3), al-Tahawi (d. 279/892-3), Hakim al-Nisaburi (d. 405 /1014-5), Ibn Kathir (d. 774 /1372-3), Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani (d. 852 /1448-9), Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (d. 974 /1566-7) have confirmed the authenticity of the references for this hadith. Moreover, there are many other direct and indirect narrations from the companions and the followers in historical and hadith references which prove the authenticity of the references of this hadith and the reason why al-Bukhari and Muslim did not narrate it must be studied separately, not in connection with their doubt for the references of this hadith. Criticism about the Authenticity Another criticism mentioned by critics of this hadith is that 'Ali (a) was not in Mecca to be able to attend in the event of Ghadir and he (a) has been doing his mission in Yemen ; while, the advocates of this hadith refer to Sunni sources which have mentioned that Imam 'Ali (a) had already returned to Mecca from Yemen and had participated in Hajj rituals of that year. Indication Hadith al-Ghadir made the ground for many discussions. Imam 'Ali (a) and Ahl al-Bayt's (a) references to this hadith are among the first usage of this hadith. Also, Shi'a theologians referred to this hadith to prove the rights and priority of Imam 'Ali (a) for caliphate . According to Shi'a theological references, al-Shaykh al-Mufid was the first theologian who extensively benefited from this hadith in his arguments. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi and al-'Allama al-Hilli also extensively benefited from this hadith in their arguments. Sunni theologians such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , Qadi Iji , al-Taftazani and al-Jurjani tried to answer Shi'a scholars and extensive discussions took place. Sunni Viewpoint Most Sunni scholars believe that the word \"Mawla\" (Arabic: مَولی ) in this hadith does not mean \"guardian\" nor \"prior in making decision for\" and rather it means \"friend and assistant\". Scholars such as al-Taftazani, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, Qadi Iji and al-Jurjani claim that \"Mawla\" cannot mean \"guardian\" and \"prior in making decision for\". They also argue that, Firstly, in Arabic, the verbal form \"Maf'al\" (Arabic: مَفعَل ) is not used for the meaning \"Awla\" (Arabic: أولی , prior). [87] Secondly, if \"Mawla\" means \"prior in making decision for\", then we must be able to use them interchangeably; while for instance in this hadith, instead of the phrase \"whoever I am his Mawla\", grammatically, one cannot put \"whoever I am his prior in making decision\". [88] In return, Shi'a scholars answered these arguments as follows, Firstly, Sunni scholars themselves have admitted that \"Mawla\" has also been used as \"prior in making decision for\". [89] Scholars of literature such as Ghyath al-Taghlabi al-Akhtal (d. 90 /708-9), [90] Abu l-Sha'tha' b. Ru'ba al-Sa'di al-'Ajaj (d. 90/708-9), [91] Abu Zakariyya Yahya b. Ziyad al-Farra' (d. 207 /822-3), [92] Abu 'Ubayda (d. 209 /824-5), al-Akhfash (d. 215 /830-1) and al-Zajjaj (d. 311 /923-4) [93] have confirmed this issue. Secondly, the second problem mentioned above is not true because if a word is not used in the place of another, it does not mean that they does not have the same meaning; e. g. according to this justification, the word \"Nasir\" [assistant] which Sunni believe as one of the meanings of the word \"Mawla\" must be able to be used with the word \"Mawla\" interchangeably, but grammatically \"Mawla\" cannot be used in the place of \"Nasir\" so the two words could not have the same meaning. Thirdly, using two synonyms interchangeably is correct if they fit in the context, whereas here they cannot be used interchangeably since \"Nasir\" is used with the article \"Min\", but \"Mawla\" is not. [94] Shi'a Viewpoint Shi'a believe that the word \"Mawla\" in this hadith means \"Awla bi-l-tasarruf\" (\"prior in making decision for\") and the same as the Prophet (s) was prior to Muslims' affairs in making decisions for them than themselves, Imam 'Ali (a) had the same priority. This opinion has two preconditions: A) \"Mawla\" means \"prior in making decision for\"; B) There's a required connection between priority [over Muslims] in making decision for [them] on one hand, and imamate and caliphate on the other. Shi'a believe that there are contextual and situational references in this hadith which suggest that the word \"Mawla\" in this hadith just and only means \"prior in making decision for\" and having this priority proved, Imam Ali's (a) imamate will also be proved, since 'Arabs use \"Awla\" (prior) only in cases where the \"Mawla\" has a responsibility for people and his orders are acceptable for them. And thus, when \"priority in making decision\" is proved, their priority of decisions for all the aspects of Muslims' lives will also be proved as the Prophet (s) had such a priority and authority: “ The Prophet has a greater right (or a greater authority) over the faithful than they have over their own selves… ” — Quran, 33:6 To prove this point, Shi'a have studied and discussed the content of this hadith. The word \"Mawla\" has been used in this hadith several times. It is a derivation of the word \"Wali\" and it is a name of God . It has different meanings. In one sense, it is rhymed with the verbal form \"Faʿīl\" (Arabic: فعيل ) meaning \"Fāʿil\" (Arabic: فاعل ) and thus has the usages of governor, ruler, guardian, manager and master. Its other usages are \"the one who has a greater right\", \"closer\", \"attached\" and \"a following lover\". Evidences for Shi'a Justification According to Shi'a, although this word has various usages, there are contextual references [in and out of the text] of this hadith which suggest that the word \"Mawla\" in this hadith just and only means \"prior authority in making decision\". These evidences are: In the Text The coherence and relation between the two phrase \"Alast Awla Bikum Min Anfusakum\"? [\"Have I not a greater right over you than your selves\"?] and \"Man Kunt Mawlah\" [\"one for whom I am the Mawla\"]: In this hadith, the Prophet (s) clarifies his greater right and authority over the faithful than themselves, based on the verse 6 of the Qur'an 33 , \"The Prophet has a greater right (or a greater authority) over the faithful than they have over their own selves….\" The greater right and authority mentioned in this verse is about the life of the faithful and also about ruling them than themselves. When there is a greater right and authority, we are required to follow and obey the one who has that greater right and authority. According to the opinions of some exegetes , the greater right and authority mentioned in this verse addresses all worldly and spiritual affairs of Muslims, since the Prophet (s) would order the faithful only to what brings them the happiness in religion and the world. Therefore, the correlation which exists between the mentioned phrase implying \"the greater right and authority\" and introducing 'Ali (a) in the other phrase shows that \"Mawla\" in the second phrase supported 'Ali's (a) greater right and authority over Muslims. Sentences at the Beginning of the Sermon At the beginning of his sermon, the Prophet (s) gave the news about his demise and then asked about unity and whether he did his mission well. These are all signs for the fact that the Prophet (s) was trying to find a solution for the period after his demise, so that the Umma would not remain without leader and guardian and the great efforts he (s) made would not be left without fruits. He (s) wanted to appoint a wise and competent successor to manage different issues after he (s) passed away and the verse 67 of Qur'an 5 is an evidence to support this claim. Situational Evidences 'Umar b. al-Khattab and Abu Bakr's Congratulations: In some versions of narrating this hadith, it is mentioned that after the Prophet's (s) sermon, 'Umar b. al-Khattab and Abu Bakr approached 'Ali (a) and congratulated his Wilaya to him. 'Umar b. al-Khattab told him, \"Happy, happy for you, O Ibn Abi Talib! You became my Mawla and the Mawla of all Muslims.\" This kind of congratulating shows that companions and other Muslims understood the word \"Mawla\" to imply the meaning of caliphate and having greater rights and authority. Hassan b. Thabit : Called them the Day of Ghadir , their Prophet (s) In Khumm , and I heard the Prophet (s) calling: \"who is your master and guardian?\" and they said without hesitation there: \"Your God is our master and you are our guardian.\" \"you will not see any disobedience in this issue from us\" Then he (s) said: \" 'Ali (a) , stand up! Surly I, have chosen you after myself, the Imam and guidance and anyone whose master I am, then this is his master so, be assistant to him and true partisans\" then [he (s) said] the Du'a , \"O God ! Be friend with whom becomes a friend of him, and for the one who oppose 'Ali (a) [as enemy], be the enemy!\" Poems of the Poets of Early Islam Some Muslims composed poems about that event, first of whom was Hassan b. Thabit . He was present there and asked the Prophet (s) for permission to compose some verses of poem about that event. In these verses, that event is mentioned as the appointment of Imam 'Ali (a) as Imam and the guidance of the Umma . Later in next years, 'Amr b. al-'As , Qays b. Sa'd b. 'Ubada , Kumayt b. Zayd al-Asadi , Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah al-Himyari , Al-Sayyid Isma'il al-Himyari narrated that event in their poems. Also, Imam 'Ali (a) composed some verses of poem about that event. 'Allama Amini mentioned the name of some poets from among the Companions , the Followers , and Muslim poets before ninth/fifteenth century. The message of all these verses and poems suggest that the understanding of the word \"Mawla\" in them has been greater right, authority and caliphate. Imam 'Ali (a) : The Prophet (s), on the Day of Ghadir, Made his Wilaya on you, an obligation for me, so woe and woe and woe, Upon one who meets his Lord tomorrow, while done injustice on me Ahl al-Bayt's (s) Giving Proofs and Referring to this Hadith In some cases, Imam 'Ali (a) referred to this hadith to prove his greater right for caliphate and imamate . Among such cases are his argument against Talha in the Battle of Jamal , his argument in the yard of the mosque of Kufa , writing some verses of poem in his letter to Mu'awiya and his argument in the Battle of Siffin . Lady Fatima (a) referred to this hadith in arguing against opponents to the caliphate of Imam 'Ali (a). Suffering Some Companions, who rejected this Hadith, from Incurable Diseases Some Companions who were present at the event of Ghadir Khumm later avoided to testify to this event and were afflicted to the curse of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) which made them afflicted with diseases. For example, Anas b. Malik contracted leprosy and Zayd b. Arqam and al-Ash'ath b. Qays became blind. This shows that it was an event more than friendship and assistance of Imam 'Ali (a) that those people rejected it and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) found them deserved to be cursed. Al-Tabligh Verse “ O Apostle! Communicate that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not, you will not have communicated His message, and Allah shall protect you from the people. Indeed Allah does not guide the faithless lot ” — Quran, 5:67 Verse 67 of Qur'an 5 which according to hadiths and the opinion of some exegetes was revealed in Hajjat al-Wida' on the way between Mecca and Medina , assigned the Prophet (s) with the announcement of a very important issue which was equal to his 23 year mission and if he (s) had not announced that, it was as if he (s) had not carried out his mission. However, it would have risks which God promised him to take care of. There are points in the verse which suggest that what the Prophet (s) had to do was announcement of the Wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) and this is mentioned by Ibn 'Abbas , Bara' b. 'Adhib and Muhammad b. 'Ali. But, some believe that the goal of this mission has been mentioning some issues such as the rulings for qisas and rajm (stoning), marriage with the wife of his adopted son Zayd , obligation of Jihad , saying the weak points and problems of Jews and Quraysh and the idols of the polytheists. However, according to what was mentioned earlier, such interpretations are incorrect. Al-Ikmal Verse “ Today the faithless have despaired of your religion. So do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam as your religion. ” — Quran, 5:3 After the sermon of the Prophet (s), a part of verse 3 of Qur'an 5 was revealed to him which shows the importance of this day. Disappointment of disbelievers from Islam , perfection of religious teachings, completion of blessings of God and God's pleasure in Islam to be the ultimate religion for people. According to some scholars, the verse mentioned the last duty in Islam and no other obligation is mentioned after that. Also the Prophet (s), after this verse revealed to him, praised God for perfection of religion. Since there was no ruling left to perfect religion and disappoint disbelievers at that time, announcement of the Wilaya of 'Ali (a) was the only issue which had all these advantages as some hadiths have mentioned this. On the contrary, some believe that perfection of religion was due to perfection of religious rulings by mentioning the rulings which meet the needs of future Muslims and thus no new religion is needed to come; while, this is not true and perfection of rulings is not related to disappointment of disbelievers in apostasy and return of Muslims to disbelief, since many disbelievers hoped that after the Prophet (s) passed away, his religion would also be forgotten after a while, but announcement of a successor after the Prophet (s) disappointed them. Moreover, the outward power of Islam was revealed on the day of the Conquest of Mecca not in 10 /632 when the event of Ghadir Khum took place. Therefore, perfection of religion was not due to exposure of the outward power of Islam on that day but some other reasons which were mentioned above. Verses at the Beginning of the Sura al-Ma'arij After the Prophet (s) announced the issue of 'Ali's Wilaya to people, a person called Nu'man b. Harith al-Fihri came to the Prophet (s) and objected that, \"You ordered us to acknowledge Unity of God, your prophethood, performing Jihad , Hajj , fasting , prayer , and giving Zakat and we accepted. But, you were not satisfied with this much until you appointed this young man as our Wali . Is this appointment your own decision or from God?!\" As soon as the Prophet (s) answered him that it was God's order, the man asked God disdainfully that if this order was from God, a stone should fall on his head from the sky. Then, a stone fell from the sky on his head and he dropped dead and the verses at the Beginning of the Qur'an 70 were then revealed: “ An asker asked for a punishment bound to befall (1) —which none can avert from the faithless— (2) from Allah, Lord of the lofty stations. ” — Quran 70:1-3 Shi'a believe that this person did not understand from the hadith but the caliphate of Imam 'Ali (a) after the Prophet (s), otherwise, if he only understood the Prophet's (s) request of people to love 'Ali (a), he would not be bothered from the Prophet's (s) announcement which would require such a grave punishment for him.

{"title": "Wadayi' al-Imamate (Trusts of Imamate)", "text": "Wadayi' al-Imamate or Trusts of Imamate (Arabic: ودائع الإمامة ) are articles from the heritage of prophets (a) , Imam Ali (a) and Lady Fatima (a) which were in possession of Imams (a) and were one of the factors to identify Imams (a). Sword and Ring of the Prophet (s) , Stick of Moses (a) , Ring of Solomon (a) , Mushaf of Fatima (a) and the books of Jafr and Jami'a are among these articles. Importance of the Issue With regards to the position of Imamate among Shi'a , knowing Imam (a) was very important for them; and in hadiths , some factors are mentioned to identify and recognize Imams (a). The most obvious factor to identify Imams (a) in the view of Shi'a is the will of previous Infallible ones (a) which is called \"Nass\" in Kalam references. But, since this factor was subject to Taqiyya in different periods, trusts of imamate were emphasized upon as well so that the doubts in recognition of Imams (a) would be removed. Historically, trusts of imamate was a factor for common people which overshadowed other factors. These articles were hidden from the public eye and only certain people could see them. Examples In hadiths, some articles are mentioned as trusts of Imamate and their existence is mentioned in phrases such as \"with us\" or \"with me\": Sword of the Prophet (s): [6] In a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , he (a) likened the sword of the Prophet (s) to the Ark of the Covenant and said: \"If the sword of the Prophet (s) is with any of us, imamate is given to him.\" [7] According to some hadiths, this sword is Dhu l-fiqar . [8] Jafr : [9] is a book in which future events until the Day of Judgment are mentioned. [10] Jami'a : is a book dictated by the Prophet (s) and written by Imam Ali (a) and contains all the permissible and the forbidden. [11] Kitab 'Ali (a): [12] some sources considered Jami'a and Book of 'Ali (a) two names for the same book; [13] but, Aqa Buzurg Tehrani referred to this book as Amali Rasul Allah (a) and considered it different from Jafr and Jami'a. [14] Mushaf of Fatima (a) : is a book that God's angels brought to Lady Fatima (a) and Imam Ali (a) wrote it. [15] Sahifa Fara'id: is about inheritance written by Imam Ali (a) [16] Ring of the Prophet (s) [17] The Prophet's (s) armor: [18] it is mentioned in hadiths that one of the signs of Imam (a) is that the Prophet's (s) armor fits him. [19] Red Jafr: is a sack containing the Prophet's (s) weapon. [20] White Jafr: is a sack containing the Torah , the Gospel , the Psalms and other divine books. [21] Book of Shi'as: which contains the names of Shi'as. In some hadiths, it is referred to as Namus. [22] Heritage of other Prophets (a) : such as the Tablets , the Basin , the Ark and the Stick of Moses (a) and the Ring of Solomon (a) . [23] Arguments against Questioners Imams (a) brought argument from trusts of Imamate which were with them against questioners and the doubts of Shi'as. In the Council of Six , Imam Ali (a) said, \"By God, is there among you anyone other than me who has the Weapon, the Standard and the Ring of the Prophet (s)?\" Imam al-Sadiq (a) who faced the two movements of Kaysaniyya and Zaydiyya , mentioned the Weapon of the Prophet (s) with him as a means for arguing against them. It is reported that he (a) was told that, \"some people think that the Sword of the Prophet (s) is with 'Abd Allah b. Hasan .\" Imam (a) answered: \"By God, 'Abd Allah b. Hasan has never seen it. The sword and the ring of the Prophet (s) is with me. The Prophet's (s) weapon is like the Ark of Covenant among Banu Israel . Wherever the Ark was found, the prophet could be found there. The same way, the one who has the Prophet's (s) weapon, will be the Imam (a) .\" After the martyrdom of Imam al-Kazim (a) , a movement called Waqifiyya was formed and claimed that Imam al-Kazim (a) was hidden and would appear after a while. It made many of Shi'a doubtful; thus, some Shi'a asked Imam al-Rida (a) about the existence of the Prophet's (s) weapon with him. Transition to the Next Imam (a) It can be learned from hadiths that trusts of Imamate were trusted from one Imam (a) to the next Imam (a), whether directly or indirectly. It is narrated from Imam al-Sadiq (a) that books were with Imam Ali (a). When he (a) went to Iraq , he (a) trusted them with Umm Salama . Then, they were with Imam al-Hasan (a) and after him, they were with Imam al-Husayn (a) , and after him, they were with Ali b. Husayn (a) and after him, they were with my father. It is also narrated that when Imam al-Husayn (a) moved to Iraq, trusted the books and the will with Umm Salama . When Ali b. Husayn (a) returned, Umm Salama gave them back to him. It is also narrated from Imam al-Baqir (a) that when Ali b. Husayn (a) was in his deathbed, he (a) brought a box and told me: \"O Muhammad (a), take this box with you.\" It contained the Sword of the Prophet (s) and his books.\" Notes References Verses Events Books Beliefs Related"}

Merits and Characteristics Historians counted him among the elites of Ansar and emphasized on his knowledge. Shi'a scholars in 'ilm al-rijal honored and admired him very much and regarded him in the rank of Salman al-Farsi and Abu Dhar among the companions of the Prophet (s). He was counted from \"Asfiya'\" among the companions of Imam 'Ali (a) . After the Prophet's (s) demise, he became one of the chosen companions of Imam 'Ali (a) and participated in the battles of Siffin and Nahrawan . It has been narrated in Rijal al-Kashshi from Imam al-Sadiq (a) that Abu Sa'id was steadfast in his religion and knew the right. Also, it has been narrated from Fadl b. Shadhan that Abu Sa'id was from pioneers of companions on that time. He narrated many hadiths from the Prophet (s). He is listed among the narrators of the Event of Ghadir Khumm . He used to say: \"I know hypocrites from their enmity toward 'Ali (a).\" He also narrated hadiths from famous companions. Among who has narrated hadith from Abu Sa'id are some companions of the Prophet (s) like: 'Abd Allah b. al-'Abbas , 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar , Jabir b. 'Abd Allah , Zayd b. Thabit , Anas b. Malik , and many of Tabi'un like: Sa'id b. Musayyib , 'Ata' b. Yasar and Nafi' . It is said that he has narrated 1170 hadiths from the Prophet (s), some of which has been quoted by authors of Sihah like al-Bukhari and Muslim . Baqi b. Khuld had collected many of Abu Sa'id's narrations in his book al-Musnad al-kabir . Abu Sa'id was known among Sahaba for his piety and ascesis. In this regard, Abu Nu'aym in Hilyat al-awliya' and Ibn al-Jawi in Safat al-safwa have described his characteristics. Participation in the Battles and Political Affairs He was 13 when the Battle of Uhud took place. His father suggested him for participation in the battle. Although his father insisted on his participation, the Prophet (s) did not accept that due to his young age. However, after the Battle of Uhud, he took part in various battles. During the caliphate of Imam 'Ali (a) he participated in the battles of Siffin and Nahrawan with Imam 'Ali (a). Abu Sa'id did not have positive opinions about Banu Umayya (Umayyad dynasty) and criticized them on various occasions one of which was when Marwan b. al-Hakam delivered the sermons of Eid prayer before the prayer. Likewise, in the caliphate period of Mu'awiya , he headed to Syria to express his objection to Mu'awiya . But what is said that he gave written allegiance to 'Abd al-Malik b. Marwan and 'Abd al-Malik was his student in narration before his caliphate is dubious ; because aside from chronological mismatch, it does not accord with the kind of relationship Abu Sa'id had with Umayyad dynasty. According to Ibn Qutayba , in the Incident of Harra –the invasion of Medina by the Syrian army- Abu Sa'id sat in his house, but the Syrian soldiers invaded his house and asked him for money, and when they did not find anything, they tortured him. According to another report, in the incident of Harra, Abu Sa'id took refuge to a cave and when a soldier came to kill him, he recognized Abu Sa'id and released him, he told Abu Sa'id to ask Allah for his forgiveness. Demise Most historians dated his demise in 74/693-4 , but some believed that he passed away a year after the incident of Harra in 64/683-4 . It is said that his ihtidar (death agony) lasted for three days. Some sources assert that he was buried in al-Baqi' Cemetery in Medina . It is also notable that there is a grave by his name in Istanbul .

'Azib al-Ansari Teknonym Abu 'Umara Lineage Banu Haritha, Aws Muhajir/Ansar Ansar Place(s) of Residence Medina , Kufa Death/Martyrdom 71 or 72 / 690-1 or 691-2 Religious Information Known for Companion of Imam 'Ali (a) Al-Barāʾ b.ʿĀzib (Arabic: براء بن عازب ) (d. 71 or 72 /690-1 or 691-2) was one of the companions of the Prophet (s) and Imam Ali (a) . He converted to Islam at a young age and took part in many of the qhazwas . He is regarded as one of the prominent transmitters of Hadith al-Ghaidr . He was also the one who – after the demise of the Prophet (s) – took the news to Banu Hashim of people's allegiance giving to Abu Bakr in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida , and he himself had refused to do so. Lineage, Teknonym and Death Al-Bara' was one of the Ansar of the Prophet (s) and belonged originally to Banu Haritha tribe of Aws in Medina . He was said to have many teknonyms, among which Abu 'Umara is the most famous. He resided in the city of Kufa , and died – while having already lost his sight – in Kufa or Medina during the reign of Mus'ab b. al-Zubayr in Iraq . Converting to Islam Before the hijra of the Prophet (s) to Medina , al-Bara', still in his early adolescent years, converted to Islam , and his father might have converted earlier. Battles of the Prophet (s) Al-Bara' and some others like 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar and Usama b. Zayd could not take part in the Battle of Badr , due to their young age. It is probable that in the Battle of Uhud as well, the Prophet (s) did not let him and some other adolescents to take part. The first battle in which he could take part was the Battle of Khandaq , while he was just 15. Although he is reported to have participated in almost 14 to 18 battles, it seems that he has not played any specific roles. According to a narration by al-Bara' himself, when the Prophet (s) has sent Khalid b. Walid to Yemen in order to spread the message of Islam , al-Bara' was accompanying his group, and as this mission was given over to Imam Ali (a) , al-Bara' joined him. Refusing to Pledge Allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Ya'qubi narrates that after the demise of the Prophet (s) , al-Bara' has reported to Banu Hashim the news of people's giving allegiance to Abu Bakr in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida , and he himself was amongst those who refused to do so. Taking Part in Conquests According to some narrations, during the last part of 'Umar 's caliphate or the first part of Uthman 's caliphate, al-Bara' b. 'Azib has taken part in or led some battles, conquering some parts of Iran , like: Rey , Qumis , Zanjan , Abhar and Qazvin . One of the conquests of Rey was also under his commander-ship. He managed to agree on peace with the people of Abhar and could make peace with the people of Qazvin with difficulty. He had to, however, conquer Zanjan through battle. All this said, it must be mentioned that at least in one narration of the \"conquest narrations\", he has been mistaken for Bara' b. Malik . Giving Allegiance to Imam Ali (a) It is said that al-Bara' b. 'Azib was among those who pledged allegiance to Imam Ali (a) . Although there is no narration indicating his participation in the battles during Imam Ali's caliphate , but based on one narration, beside taking part in the Battles of Jamal , Siffin and Nahrawan , he was also appointed by Imam Ali (a) in the Battle of Nahrawan to undertaking the mission of turning the Kawarij to Imam Ali's camp. Narrations Al-Bara' narrated some hadiths from the Prophet (s) . Some of these narrations show how interested he was in the prophetic accounts, hadiths and life. He is also regarded as one of the transmitter of hadith al-Ghadir . Al-Bara' has also narrated from some of the companions of the Prophet (s) and al-Sha'bi , 'Udayy b. Thabit , Abu Ishaq al-Sabi'i , as well as two of his sons have narrated from him. Imam al-Husayn's Martyrdom In his book al-Irshad , al-Shaykh al-Mufid narrates from Isma'il b. Ziyad , \"One day Imam Ali (a) told al-Bara' b. 'Azib: 'O al-Bara'! my son will be martyred and you won't help him, although you'll be alive on that day'\". After the Battle of Karbala , al-Bara' said: \"What Ali (a) had said was realized, because his son was martyred and I didn't help him\". Then he regretted deeply for that.

He attended the battles of Jamal , Nahrawan and Siffin . 'Amr b. al-Hamiq was martyred by agents of Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan , and his head was the first head that was circulated in cities. He is one of the hadith transmitters of Hadith al-Ghadir . Before Islam 'Amr b. al-Hamiq b. Kahin b. Habib al-Khuza'i is from the Khuza'a tribe. There is no information about his life before Islam. But as it is said that he was eighty years old when he was martyred in 50 /670-1, it can be said that he lived about thirty years before Hijra . During the Prophet's (s) Life After the Hudaybiyya Peace Treaty , 'Amr migrated to Medina , joined the Prophet (s) and converted to Islam. 'Amr b. al-Hamiq was a companion of the Prophet (s) and recorded some hadiths from him. Jubayr b. Nufayr , Rifa'a b. Shaddad and others narrated hadiths from him. He was also a narrator of Hadith al-Ghadir . It is quoted that once he supplied water for the Prophet (s), the Prophet (s) prayed for him as follows: \"O' God! Bless him with his youth\". Because of this praying, 'Amr lived 80 years without having one white hair string in his head and face. During the Realm of Three Caliphs After demise of the Prophet (s) he resided in Syria (some said in Egypt ), and then moved to Kufa and stayed there. According to al-Tabari, 'Amr b. al-Hamiq al-Khuza'i and other opponents of 'Uthman in Kufa arranged a meeting. Sa'id b. al-'As reported their opposition to 'Uthman, and 'Uthman ordered their exile to Syria. According to Abu 'Umar in al-Isti'ab , 'Amr was one of the protesters who demonstrated against 'Uthman, and he was one of the four people who went to 'Uthman's house. Some introduce him as the murderer of 'Uthman. See Also: Murder of Uthman A Companion of Imam 'Ali (a) and Imam al-Hasan (a) During Imam 'Ali 's (a) caliphate , 'Amr was one of the distinguished companions of Imam. Al-Kashshi introduce him as one of disciples of Imam Ali (a). According to a count, he was to Imam 'Ali (a) like Salman al-Farsi to the Prophet (s). He attended the Battle of Jamal , Battle of Nahrawan and Battle of Siffin . Imam Ali (a) told him: \"I wish I had 100 people like you in my army\", and then prayed for him as follows: \"O' God! lighten his heart with piety and show him the right path!\" When, in the Battle of Siffin, volumes of the Qur'an were put on spears by the army of Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan , he supported Imam Ali (a) and opposing that group he said to Imam Ali (a): :\"O' Amir al-Mu'minin (a) ! I swear to God that we have not followed you out of prejudice and bias. We have followed God's commands and we have sought only the right path. And if someone else invited us to what you invite us, it would be subject to disputes and the truth would disappear.\" 'Amr b. al-Hamiq, in the Arbitration , was one of the people along with al-Hasan b. 'Ali (a) , al-Husayn b. Ali (a) , 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas , 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far , and Malik al-Ashtar , in Imam Ali's (a) meeting with Mu'awiya's representative, witnessed conditions that Imam (a) posed for the Arbitration. Martyrdom He was a companion of Imam al-Hasan (a) as well. After Peace Treaty of Imam al-Hasan (a) , Ziyad was appointed as the governor of Kufa and began to chase and kill the prominent Shiite figures, 'Amr fled from Kufa. But he was martyred by the agents of Mu'awiyay in 50 /670-1. There is disagreement about his martyrdom: Some said that Mu'awiya killed him after giving him a safe conduct. The Letter of Imam al-Husayn (a) to Mu'awiya confirm this acount: \"Was not it you who martyred 'Amr b. al-Hamiq al-Khuza'i whose face and body was sickly out of worshiping God? And did you not do this after giving him a safe conduct? A safe conduct that if you gave to deer of deserts, they would confidently come down the mountains.\" Some said he was arrested by Balta'a b. Abi 'Abd Allah—one of Mu'awiya's agents. Balta'a sent him to 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abd Allah al-Thaqafi, the ruler of Mosul. He recognized 'Amr and wrote a letter to Mu'awiya concerning his case. Mu'awiya accused 'Amr of having a role in murdering 'Uthman, and replied that 'Amr should be retaliated by 9 strokes (as he allegedly stroked 'Uthman 9 times). The order was executed and 'Amr was martyred by the first or second stroke. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr wrote that 'Amr b. al-Hamiq was killed by a snake's bite when he was taking a rest in a cave. However, Ziyad's agent who was chasing 'Amr found his corpse, decapitated his head and sent it Ziyad who sent it in turn to Mu'awiya. Events after Martyrdom Mu'awiya ordered that 'Amr's head be circulated in cities. Then he ordered that 'Amr's head be sent to his imprisoned wife, Amina bt. Shurayd. His agents threw his head to his wife's lap. She sent a curse to Mu'awiya. He ordered his agents to bring her to him. There was then a harsh conversation between her and Mu'awiya. 23 'Amr b. al-Hamiq's Resting Place According to Ibn Athir, 'Amr b. al-Hamiq's resting place outside Mosul was very well-known and frequently visited by people. There is a huge darih built over his grave. Abu 'Abd Allah Sa'id b. Hamdan, the cousin of Sayf al-Dawla and Nasir al-Dawla al-Hamdani,was the first person who constructed 'Amr's grave in Sha'ban 336/ February - March 948.

He attended most of the Prophet's (s) battles ( ghazwas ). He was the head of the Aslam b. Afsa tribe. His conversion to Islam led to the conversion of many people in his tribe to Islam. After the demise of the Prophet (s) he supported Imam 'Ali (a) and refused to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr . Lineage Burayda's father is mentioned in many sources as \"al-Husayb\" and in some of Shia source as \"Khuḍayb\". He was the head of the Aslam b. Afsa tribe. He was known with different teknonyms such as Abu 'Abd Allah, Abu Sahl, Abu l-Husayb, and Abu Sasan, but he is most commonly known as Abu 'Abd Allah. In the Period of the Prophet (s) During the Prophet's (s) immigration from Mecca to Medina , when the Prophet (s) had a sojourn in al-Ghamim station, Burayda and 80 families associated with him went to the Prophet (s) and converted to Islam. But on Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani's account, he converted to Islam after the Battle of Badr . Burayda only joined the Prophet (s) in Medina after the Battle of Uhud . After this battle, he moved to Medina and attended all the Prophet's (s) later battles. In 9/630-1, he was once commissioned by the Prophet (s) to receive taxes from Aslam and Ghifar tribes and once again to call them to join the Battle of Tabuk . He narrated hadiths from the Prophet (s), and Abu Dawud, the author of Musnad cited his hadiths. His son, 'Abd Allah b. Burayda and his grandsons, Aws b. 'Abd Allah and Sahl b. 'Abd Allah also narrated hadiths from him. He narrated a hadith according to which the Prophet (s) told him, Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa , 'Umar b. Khattab , Talha , and al-Zubayr to greet 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) as Amir al-Mu'minin , and they did so.

Ziyad were among the 50,000 people who moved from Basra and Kufa to Khorasan in 51/671-2 at the command of Ziyad b. Abih . Love of Imam 'Ali (a) His love for Imam 'Ali (a) goes back to his company of the Imam (a) during a trip to Yemen . On this trip, Khalid b. al-Walid who was dissatisfied with Imam 'Ali's (a) performance, sent Burayda to the Prophet (s) in order to express his complaints of Imam 'Ali (a). When he went to the Prophet (s) and heard the Prophet's (s) word about Imam 'Ali (a), he began to love the Imam (a). When Abu Bakr was appointed as the caliph after the demise of the Prophet (s), he went to the Banu Aslam tribe and installed a flag among them, calling people to object to Abu Bakr's caliphate and pledge their allegiance to Imam 'Ali (a). He narrated many hadiths from the Prophet (s) with regard to the virtues of Imam 'Ali (a), including: The Event of Ghadir Khumm . [12] The story of the Prophet (s) taking back the flag from Abu Bakr and giving it to 'Ali (a) in the Battle of Khaybar .

{"title": "Hassan b. Thabit", "text": "Hassan b. Thabit Personal Information Full Name Hassan b. Thabit Teknonym Abu l-Walid, Abu l-Husam, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, Abu l-Mudarrab Lineage Khazraj tribe, the Banu Najjar clan Muhajir/Ansar Ansar Death/Martyrdom Between 40 - 54 /660-674 Religious Information Ḥassān b. Thābit (Arabic: حَسّان بن ثابِت ) is one of the greatest Arab poets from before and through to the early ages of Islam. He has been considered as one of the Prophet 's (s) companions, and has written poems in favor to the Prophet (s) and in satire of his enemies, although he has not taken part in any of the ghazwas of the early Islam. According to history records, when Imam 'Ali (a) became caliph, Hassan b. Thabit refused to pledge allegiance to him. Hassan has great poems and is famous as the greatest urbanite Arab poet. His many poems mention historical events, defends the Prophet (s), and uses new figures of speech, which are some of the features that make his poems important. Nickname His nicknames were Abu l-Walid, Abu l-Husam, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman and Abu l-Mudarrab. He was also called Husam. Before Islam Hassan was originally from Yemen . He was born a couple of years before the birth of the Noble Prophet (s) ( 'Am al-Fil ) and was raised there. Hassan was from the Khazraj tribe , the Banu Najjaar clan, and a relative to the Noble Prophet (s). His father, Thabit, and his grandfather, Mondhir, were of the nobles of the Khazraj tribe. His mother, Quray'a, was from the same tribe, and converted to Islam after the Noble Prophet's (s) migration to Medina . Hassan has also been addressed as ibn Quray'a. Hassan used to frequently visit the Ghassanids court (the rulers of Levant ) and the kings of Al- Hira (in Iraq ) to collect money by praising them. He kept this habit all the way to his death. He became blind at the end of his life. Prophet's (s) Era Hassan was Jewish but converted to Islam when the Prophet (s) migrated to Medina . He is thought to have been sixty years old when he became a Muslim, but Brockelmann believes he was younger. Absence in the Holy Battles Hassan was scared of war and as a result, never took part in any of the Holy Battles of Islam. Nevertheless, he used to decorate himself to look like a lion and composed poems in praise of his own bravery, which would bring a smile to the Prophet's (s) face. Poems in Defense of Islam and Satire of its Enemies Hassan had a sharp tongue. He would satirise the polytheists and defend the Prophet (s), making him a source of peace for the Prophet (s), and respected by him. It is written that the Prophet (s) used to approve him and say that Hassan is blessed by the Angel of Revelation . On the command of the Noble Prophet (s), he learned the fathers and ancestors of the polytheists from Abu Bakr , and mocked them in a way that wouldn't insult the Prophet (s) or his ancestors, astonishing the polytheists, and winning the Prophet's (s) appraise. When Banu Tamim stood against the Prophet (s) and felt proud and glorified of what they had done, Hassan defended the Prophet (s) in such a way that all of them converted to Islam. The Story of Ifk Hassan was questioned in the event of Ifk as well. As an apology to the Prophet (s) and Aisha , he composed a praising poem for Aisha and recalled his background in Islam with the Prophet (s). The Prophet's (s) prayer for Hassan The Prophet (s) prayed for Hassan, اللهم ایده بروح القدس \"O Lord! Make him approved by the Holy Spirit .\" It seems that the prayer was preconditioned since many scholars believe the Prophet (s) told him, \"O Hassan, you will be blessed with the approval of the Holy Spirit, as long as you defend us.\" The prayer has been quoted in various ways. In one narration, the prayer says, \"O Lord, support Hassan through the Holy Spirit, because of his support of Islam.\" Another narration states, إن اللّه یؤید حسّان بروح القدس ما نافح عن رسول اللّه \"May God support Hassan through the Holy Spirit, so long as he supports God's Messenger (s)\". Hassan and the 'Uthmanis In the events of 'Uthman b. 'Affaan 's Avengers, Hassan joined the Othmanis, yet the poems which have been attributed to Hassan on supporting 'Uthman and condemning his murderers, are not very authentic. Shawqi Dayf believes these poems were created by the 'Umayyad to compensate for the humiliation caused by Hassan's poems against the Quraysh . Refusing Allegiance to Imam Ali (a) Some people refused to give Imam Ali (a) their allegiance when he was positioned as Caliph, Hassan b. Thabit was one of them. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid writes, \"Some people refused from giving allegiance to Ali (a), such as, 'Abd Allah the son of 'Umar b. al-Khattab , Sa'd Waqqas , Muhammad b. Salama , Hassan b. Thabit and Usaama b. Zayd . After they refused, Imam Ali (a) delivered a speech where he said, \"… Sa'd, Muslima, 'Usama, Abd Allah and Hassan have done something which I am not happy with, may God judge on us\". Death With over a hundred years in age, Hassan became the longest living Mukhadram (people who lived in the Jahiliyya era and Islam ), with approximately half of his life being spent after the Prophet 's (s) migration to Medina . The year he died has been narrated to be somewhere between 40-54/660-674. Hassan's Poetic Position Hassan is known to be the best urbanite poet of the Arabs. His poems created happiness and joy and he kept this ability all through his life; before the rise of Islam and after it. It should be noted that, Asma'i believed that after the rise of Islam, Hassan's poems started to weaken. Hassan has many great poems, but one of his best pieces is in the praise of the Ghassanid princes in the Jahiliyya era . Although he was one of the Mudhahhabat (poets whose poems where written in gold), but the verses he read in the 'Ukaadh Bazaar, in front of A'sha and Khansa to Nabegha Dhebyani were ignored, and Hutay'a believed his poems did not have the right structure. Hassan's Collection Many narrators, such as Ibn Habib (died 238/852), have narrated and gathered Hassan's poems but, the quantity of poems which have been claimed to be composed by him is unprecedented; it seems that many of them may have been composed by the Quraysh in his name. Also, poems belonging to his son, 'Abd al-Rahman, and other poets, specifically Ka'b b. Malik and 'Abd Allah b. Rawaha , may have been mistaken for Hassan's poems. Importance of Hassan's Poems Historical Events Hassan's poems mention historical events, traditions of the Prophet (s) , and the Holy Battles, making it an authentic source for Early Islamic history. His poem on Ghadir Khumm is the first Ghadiriyya (poems composed regarding the event of Ghadir Khumm) in Islamic history. Defending the Prophet In addition, Hassan's defense of the Noble Prophet (s) has made him the forerunner of political poets. In his praises of the Prophet (s) , he used a new method to facilitate words and expressions, which was novel to Jahili literacy. Therefore, he is considered the founder of a new poetic structure. Use of New Figures of Speech Other than praises, pride, and satire, his poems consist of lamentation as well. Farrokh believes that since Hassan has used new figures of speech in praising the Prophet, he can be considered as the first figure of speech Poet (Badi'iyah Sara) in history.

{"title": "Yawm al-Ruhba", "text": "Yawm al-Ruḥba (Arabic: يَوْم الرُحْبَة ) is the day in which Imam Ali (a) asked those people in al-Ruhba in Kufa who had witnessed the Event of Ghadir to testify about Hadith al-Ghadir . A number of the Prophet (s)'s companion and companions of Imam Ali (a)—between twelve to thirty people—stood up and testified that they had heard Hadith al-Ghadir from the Prophet (s). The story of al-Ruhba is also known as \"Munashadat al-Ruhba\" ( مناشدة الرحبة ). It is cited in many Shiite and Sunni sources. 'Allama Amini maintains that the story of the Day of Ruhba is mutawatir . What is al-Ruhba? There are different things to which \"Al-Ruhba\" can refer. However, it seems that in this story it refers to a place in the middle of the courtyard of the Mosque of Kufa where Imam Ali (a) usually sat for adjudication or preaching. It is said that during the period of Ziyad b. Abih , transmitters of hadiths who did not dare explicitly mention Imam Ali (a), referred to him as \"Sahib al-Ruhba\". According to Mutarrazi (d. 610/1213-4), al-Ruhba in Kufa was a stone bench in the middle of the Mosque of Kufa where Imam Ali (a) sat and preached people. This is the same \"Ruhba\" on which Imam Ali (a) put the booties of the battle with Khawarij . Munashadat al-Ruhba The story of the Day of Ruhba is also referred to as \"Munashadat al-Ruhba\". \"Munashada\" means to make a request for the sake of God. The story is thus known because at the beginning of his remarks, Imam Ali (a) said, \"Unshid Allah\" ( أُنشِدُ الله ), that is, for the sake of Allah I ask you. Thus he asked the participants to testify about Hadith al-Ghadir . \"For the sake of Allah, I ask those who have met the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his family, and have heard his remarks on the Day of Ghadir al-Khumm, to stand up and testify what they had heard!\" Date of the Event The story of al-Ruhba took place in 35/655-6, that is, at the beginning of the caliphate of Imam Ali (a) . For according to the hadith by Ya'la b. Murra , Amir al-Mu'minin (a) made these remarks when he arrived in Kufa . The Story of al-Ruhba According to 'Allama Amini , in 35/655-6, when there were conflicts and disputes with Amir al-Mu'minin (a) with respect to caliphate , some people expressed doubts about what was allegedly transmitted from the Prophet (s) over the superiority of Ali (a) over others with respect to imamate and caliphate. When he heard about such doubts, Imam Ali (a) went to a huge square at the center of Kufa . He defended the truth and rejected the arguments of people against his caliphate among a large population of people there\". After the Imam's (a) remarks, some companion stood up and testified that they had heard Hadith al-Ghadir from the Prophet (s). According to some sources, some people such as Zayd b. Arqam refused to testify and were then cursed by the Imam (a). Number of Testifiers The number of people who testified on the Day of al-Ruhba that they had heard Hadith al-Ghadir is differently reported in different Shiite and Sunni sources. According to these reports, they were at least twelve and at most thirty. 'Allama Amini appeals to reliable Sunni sources to show that they were twenty four. However, other Sunni scholars such as Ahmad b. Hanbal made it explicit that they were thirty. The best-known people who testified on the Day of Ruhba: Abu 'Umra al-Ansari , Abu l-Haytham b. al-Tayyihan , Abu Ayyub al-Ansari , Khuzayma b. Thabit (Dhu l-Shahadatayn), Sahl b. Hunayf , Abu Sa'id al-Khudri , Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi , 'Abd Allah b. Thabit al-Ansari (the servant of the Prophet (s)), 'Ubayd b. 'Azib al-Ansari , 'Adi b. Hatim al-Ta'i , Najiya b. 'Amr al-Khuza'i , Nu'man b. 'Ajlan al-Ansari . Transmitters According to 'Allama Amini, transmitters of \"Munashadat al-Ruhba\" were eighteen, four of whom were from the companions (sahaba) and fourteen of whom were followers (tabi'un). Here are those transmitters: Companion Habba b. Juwayn al-'Urani Zayd b. Arqam Abu l-Tufayl al-Kinani Ya'li bin Marra bin Wahab al-Thaqafi Followers Abu Sulayman Mu'adhin Asbagh b. Nubata Zadhan b.

Abd Allah al-Ansari where Jabir is buried Personal Information Full Name Jābir b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Ansāri Teknonym Abu 'Abd Allah Lineage Khazraj Muhajir/Ansar Ansar Place(s) of Residence Medina , and about one year in Mecca Death/Martyrdom Between 68 /687-8 and 79 /698-9 Burial Place Medina Religious Information Presence at ghazwas Participation in 19 ghazwa of prophet (s) out of 27 Jābir b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Ansārī (Arabic: جابر بن عبدالله الأنصاري ) was a companion of Prophet Muhammad (s) , he took an oath of allegiance to Prophet Muhammad (s) in the second Pledge at al-'Aqaba . Jabir had a friendly relationship with Prophet Muhammad (s). He attended a large number of battles ( ghazwa and sariyya ) in his life. Jabir has narrated a great deal of hadith . He narrated hadith of Lawh , which contains the names of twelve Shi'a Imams narrated from Prophet Muhammad (s), and also other famous hadiths including hadith of Ghadir Khumm , hadith of Thaqalayn and hadith of the City of Knowledge . Jabir was a true devotee of Ahl al-Bayt (a) and supporter of Imam 'Ali (a) . He was considered a prominent companion of Ahl al-Bayt (a), from Imam 'Ali (a) to Imam al-Baqir (a) . After the Event of Karbala , Jabir was the first one who visited the burial site of Imam al-Husayn (a) in the Day of Arba'in . Jabir has also given the salam (greeting) of Prophet Muhammad (s) to Imam al-Baqir (a). Life and Lineage Jabir b. 'Abd Allah was the son of 'Amr, son of Haram b. Ka'b b. Ghanm b. Salama, and from the tribe of Khazraj . The first evidence on Jabir is related to his attendance in the second Pledge of al-'Aqaba with his father in 1 BH/622. He was the youngest person who witnessed Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj 's oath of allegiance to Prophet Muhammad (s) . Considering the time of his death and his lifetime, he could have been around 16 on the time. His father was among the twelve naqibs of the Prophet (s) who were chosen as a representative to their own tribes. 'Abd Allah took part in the Battle of Badr and was martyred in the Battle of Uhud . Due to the number of his children, different kunyas were attributed to Jabir; \"Abu 'Abd Allah\" is considered the most famous kunya of Jabir . According to some of the historical accounts, Jabir had a friendly relationship with Prophet Muhammad (s) . The Prophet promised him a long life. Answering the question of Jabir on dividing the bequest a verse was sent down to the Prophet (s) which is known as the al-Kalala verse . . Marriage and Children In the third year after Hijra and before the Battle of Dhat al-Riqa' , Jabir married a widow called Suhayma, the daughter of Mas'ud b. Aws. 'Abd al-Rahman, Muhammad , Mahmud, 'Abd Allah and 'Aqil are the names of Jabir's children. Some historical accounts mentioned a number of Jabir's descendants who were settling in Africa (around Tunisia ) and Bukhara . Also several descendants of Jabir settled in Iran , the most important of which is Shaykh Murtada Ansari who is a prominent contemporary Shi'a scholar in fiqh and usul . Participation in the Battles At a young age, Jabir attended a large number of battles ( ghazwa and sariyya ). The number of the battles he has participated is different in historical reports. As he said, he attended 19 out of 27 ghazwas alongside Prophet Muhammad (s) , and also attended several sariyyas. Jabir did not participate in the battles of Uhud and Badr to obey his father's order and manage his crowded family's affairs. Although in some historical accounts, he was named as a person who carried water in the Battle of Badr. In the Time of the Three Caliphs There is no information on Jabir b. 'Abd Allah attitude toward the first caliph, Abu Bakr . It's probable that he was among Ansar (Helpers) and Muhajirun (Emigrants) in Medina . After some time he joined the supporters of Imam 'Ali (a) and Ahl al-Bayt (a) . He was engaged with scientific and educational affairs; he mostly avoided political and military affairs. The only battle he participated in was at the beginning of military conquests of Muslims during the reign of the second Caliph, 'Umar b. al-Khattab . In a historical account, Jabir has explained his participation in Khalid b. Walid's army, when they surrounded Damascus . However, it is not clear whether Jabir was engaged in conquering Iraq or he joined them in other regions. Jabir was an 'Arif in the time of 'Umar b. al-Khattab. 'Arif, the chief member of each tribe or clan, was chosen by the caliph as the mutual connector between the caliph and the tribe. There is very little information about Jabir's activities in the time of the third Caliph . We only know, on the last days of Uthman's caliphate , when the Egyptian protesters head toward Medina , Jabir and fifty other members of Ansar were ordered by the Caliph to negotiate with the protestors and persuade them to return to Egypt . Imam 'Ali's (a) Caliphate Jabir has fought alongside Imam 'Ali (a) in the Battle of Siffin . In the last days of Imam 'Ali's (a) caliphate, Mu'awiya army attacked and plundered cities, including Medina , to take the oath of allegiance from people. Busr b. Artat was the one who attacked Medina in 40/660-1 to take an oath of allegiance from people including Banu Salama, the tribe of Jabir. Jabir thought taking an oath of allegiance to Busr b. Artat would be going astray. So he hid in Umm Salama 's house, Prophet Muhammad's wife. Finally, to avoid bloodshed, Jabir took Umm Salama's advice and took an oath of allegiance to Busr. Umayyad Dynasty Jabir was well aware of Qur'an and sunna , so he was annoyed by the wrongdoings and bid'as (innovations) of Umayyads . It was so unbearable to him that he wished to become deaf not to hear the news of bid'as. When Mu'awiya came to power he decided to transfer the minbar (pulpit) of Prophet Muhammad (s) to Damascus in 50 /670-1. Jabir was among those who dissuaded him and changed his mind. Al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf was the governor of Hijaz from 72 /691-2 to 75/694-5. He went to Medina in 74/693-4 and stayed there for two months, where he treated people with contempt. He also tortured several Companions of Prophet Muhammad (s) including Jabir b. 'Abd Allah. The only reaction of Jabir was changing his behavior toward him. He also said al-Hajjaj must not attend his funeral prayer . Travels Jabir traveled to Egypt in 50 /670-1 where a number of Egyptians have narrated hadith from him. Maslama b. Mukhallad al-Ansari , a tribal member of Jabir, was the governor of Egypt at that time. As Ibn Manda said in his accounts, Jabir traveled to Syria and Egypt along with Maslama. According to hadith sources, Jabir traveled to Syria in the time of Mu'awiya to acquire a hadith on qisas (retaliation) from 'Abd Allah b. Unays , but Mu'awiya ignored him. Jabir was upset, so he refused a 600 Dinar gift from Mu'awiya and returned to Medina . Narration Jabir has narrated a great deal of hadith from Prophet Muhammad (s) , hence he is considered the guardian of sunna and a mukthir (a person who has narrated abundant number of hadith). His narrations are considered as one of the highest referred ones among Islamic sects in narration , sira and history. Jabir was also knowledgeable in fiqh and he has being issued fatwa. Therefore, al-Dhahabi identified him as mujtahid and faqih (jurist). In addition to narrating hadith directly from Prophet Muhammad (s), Jabir also has narrated hadith from Companions and Followers . He has narrated hadith from 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , Ammar b. Yasir , Talha b. 'Ubayd Allah , Mu'adh b. Jabal , and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri . Jabir was so immersed in learning theology that he traveled to Syria in order to acquire hadith from one of Companions. This enthusiasm led Jabir to live the last years of his life in Mecca . He fairly analyzed hadiths and avoided any biased comment or attitude in narrating hadith . Imam al-Baqir (a) directly, and Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Kazim (a) indirectly have narrated hadiths of Prophet Muhammad (s) from Jabir b. 'Abd Allah. Jabir has narrated well-known hadiths of Shi'a , including hadith al-Ghadir , hadith al-Thaqalayn , hadith of the City of Knowledge , Hadith al-Manzila , hadith Radd al-Shams and hadith Sadd al-Abwab . Jabir has also narrated hadith al-Lawh , a famous and important hadith in which Prophet Muhammad (s) has declared the names of twelve Imams and described Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It is regarded as the most well-known hadith that Jabir has narrated from Prophet Muhammad (s). Teaching Circle Jabir b. 'Abd Allah had a teaching circle in the al-Masjid al-Nabawi . He also dictated hadiths and taught a number of Tabi'un . Sa'id b. al-Musayyib , Hasan b. Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya , 'Ata' b. Abi Rabah , Mujahid b. Jabr , 'Amr b. Dinar , 'Amir b. Sharahil al-Sha'bi and Hasan al-Basri have narrated hadiths from Jabir b. 'Abd Allah. Jurist of Medina Al-Dhahabi identified him as the jurist of Medina . Musa b. 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Amir has obtained a complete report of Jabir's opinion in fiqh from different narration sources. It was published under the name of Jabir b. 'Abd Allah wa fiqhihi . Tafsir of Quran Numerous quotations were narrated from Jabir on tafsir (interpretation) of Qur'an , which are alike in many ways with Tafsir of Shi'a on some verses. In Shi'a Sources Jabir is admired in twelver Shi'a rijal sources. Because Jabir was praised in well-known hadiths, his reliability is accepted in Shi'a sources. He is regarded as a companion of Ahl al-Bayt (a) , including Imam 'Ali (a) , Imam al-Hasan (a) , Imam al-Husayn (a) , Imam al-Sajjad (a) , and Imam al-Baqir (a) . But it should be noticed that when Jabir has passed away in the time of 'Ali b. Husayn's (a) imamate , Muhammad b. 'Ali (a) was only a child or a teenager. Thus Jabir cannot be considered as a companion of Imam al-Baqir (a). Although Jabir was not a supporter of Imam 'Ali (a) in the Event of al-Saqifa , after some time he joined Imam 'Ali (a) and remained a true supporter of him. Al-Kashshi considered him one of the members of Shurtat al-Khamis who were a group of devoted fighters who dedicated their lives to Imam 'Ali (a). Works According to the sources of Sunni Muslims , Jabir has narrated 540 hadith, Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim both accord with 58 hadiths. Ahmad b. Hanbal has collected hadiths which were narrated by Jabir in his Musnad . According to 'Abd Allah b. Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Hanbal, the hand-written musnad (collection of hadith) of Jabir b. 'Abd Allah is preserved in al-Khazanat al-Rabat in Morocco , which is probably hadiths narrated by Jabir in Musnad Ahmad b. Hanbal . Husayn Wathiqi also has collected the narrations of Jabir from Shi'a sources and published them in the book Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari, hayatuhu wa musnaduh (his life and musnad). Sahifat Jabir is the most important work of Jabir, which is an example among the oldest works on hadith which was collected by Sulayman b. Qays al-Yashkuri. Because Sulayman died untimely, other narrators have quoted hadith from the book without qira'a and sama' (narrated from the text not directly hearing from Sulayman). Shahid Ali Pasha collection contains an edition of the sahifa which is situated in the Sulaymaniyya Library of Istanbul . Relation with Ahl al-Bayt (a) Advice for Loving 'Ali (a) Jabir b. 'Abd Allah considered Imam 'Ali (a) as the criterion for judgment at the time of the Prophet (s) , and hypocrites are got known by their hate towards 'Ali (a). He advised Ansar to grow their children with the love of 'Ali (a). He said that whoever does not recognize 'Ali (a) as the best humankind, he has done ingratitude towards God. Jabir's famous quotation on Imam 'Ali (a) is: \"'Ali (a) is the best mankind\", inspired Ja'far b. Ahmad al-Qummi, Shi'a author, to narrate one-third of his hadith from Jabir in his book Nawadir al-athar fi 'Ali khayr al-bashar . Battle of Karbala At the time of the Event of Karbala , Jabir was an old man living in Medina . Giving a speech to 'Ubayd Allah b. Ziyad 's soldiers, Imam al-Husayn (a) introduced him as his witness. Jabir was the first one who visited Karbala , in Arba'in . Supporting Imam al-Sajjad (a) At the beginning of 'Ali b. al-Husayn 's (a) imamate , Imam had only a few companions including Jabir b. 'Abd Allah. Due to his old age, Jabir was not prosecuted by al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf . Meeting with Imam al-Baqir (a) According to historical accounts, Prophet Muhammad (s) told Jabir: \"You will have a long life so that you will meet one of my descendants whose name will be my name; he is called Revealer of Knowledge . When you meet him, send my salam (greetings) to him.\" Thus Jabir was eagerly looking for him. Sometimes he calls \"O! the revealer of knowledge\" in the Masjid al-Nabi . Finally, he found Muhammad b. 'Ali (a) , who was a teenager; he recalled the saying of the Prophet (s), kissed al-Baqir (a) and sent the salam (greetings) of Prophet Muhammad (s) to him. Demise Jabir has lived the last year of his lifetime near the Ka'ba in Mecca and then passed away in Medina. Al-Mizzi gave some reports on the time of Jabir's demise; the reports are different from 68/687-8 to 79/698-9. According to a group of historians and hadith narrators , Jabir passed away in 78 /697-8 at the age of 94. It's said that Aban b. 'Uthman , the governor of Medina, performed the funeral prayer on his body. Regarding the fact that at the time that al-Hajjaj settled in Medina, Jabir was there, it seems Jabir passed away after 74 /693-4.

{"title": "Khaythama b. 'Abd al-Rahman", "text": "Khaythama b. 'Abd al-Rahman Companion of Imam al-Baqir (a) • Imam al-Sadiq (a) Teknonym Abu 'Abd al-Rahman Epithet al-Ju'fi Religious Affiliation Shi'a Lineage Madhhij tribe Place(s) of Residence Kufa Khaythama b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (Arabic: خَیثَمَة بن عَبدالرَّحمان ) is a Shi'a hadith narrator of the 2nd/8th century and one of the companions of Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) . He is one of the famous figures of Al Abi Sabura . Khaythama met many sahaba and has narrated hadith from some of them. He has narrated hadiths about the virtues of infallible Imams (a) . There are some hadiths indicating that Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) had trust in him. In addition to Shi'a scholars, some Sunni scholars of rijal said that he is reliable ( Thiqa ). Great hadith narrators such as Ibn Muskan and Abu Basir have narrated hadiths from him. Lineage and Kuniya His Kunya is Abu 'Abd al-Rahman. He is from the clan of Ju'fi form the tribe of Madhhij; and therefore, he is known as Ju'fi. His grandfather, Abu Sabura Yazid b. Malik, was the first member of his tribe to embrace Islam , and pledged allegiance to Prophet Muhammad (s) as a representative of his tribe. His two sons accompanied him. They emigrated from Yemen to Kufa and resided there. Khaythama's father's name was 'Aziz. However, Prophet Muhammad (s) changed his name to 'Abd al-Rahman. The Kuniya of 'Abd al-Rahman is Abu Khaythama. Family Several members of Khaythama's family were Shi'a Muhaddiths , who lived in Kufa. They were known as Banu Abi Sabura. In addition to his grandfather and father, who were Companions of the Prophet (s), his brothers - Isma'il, Jamil and Husayn - his nephews - 'Umar b. Isma'il, Muhammad b. Isma'il, Masqalt b. Isma'il, Muhammad b. Husayn, Bastam b. Husayn and Ali b. Yunus b. 'Abd al-Rahman - and his son, Ziyad, were among the companions of Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a). According to al-Najashi the credibility of Isma'il b. 'Abd al-Rahman is more than the others. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi also said Isma'il is faqih and from Tabi'in (the Follower) and a companion of Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a), and Aban b. 'Uthman , Ishaq b. 'Ammar and Safwan b. Yahya , who are all among the great companions of Imam al-Sadiq (a), have narrated Hadiths from him. Ismai'l passed away during the lifetime of Imam al-Sadiq (a) and the Imam (a) prayed for him. Bastam b. Husayn was a companion of Imam al-Sadiq (a) and had a book. Companion of Two Imams Khaythama's name is mentioned among the companions of Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a). In some Hadiths he was called Khaythama al-Ju'fi or Khaythama b. Abi Khaythama; however, he must not be confused with another narrator who is mentioned in Sunni Rijal sources named Khaythama b. Abi Khaythama al-Basri, whose Kuniya is Abu Nasr. Al-Najashi has mentioned a narrator named Khaythama who had a book, which Muhammad b. 'Isa b. 'Abd Allah Ash'ari - a companion of Imam al-Rida (a) and Imam al-Jawad (a) - has narrated. Nevertheless, considering the long interval between Khaythama and Muhammad b. 'Isa, it is most likely that Khaythama who had a book is different from Khaythama b. 'Abd al-Rahman. Accordingly, what al-Turayhi has said that Khaythama b. 'Abd al-Rahman can be identified by narration of Muhammad b. 'Isa from him, is wrong. Moreover, there is no Hadith with this chain of narrators; i.e. Muhammad b. 'Isa from Khaythama. Reliability Early Shi'a Rijal scholars said that he is Wajih (creditable) and Fadil (virtuous). Considering the words of al-Najashi about him and his narration, later scholars said that he is Thiqa (reliable). There are also Hadiths from the Imams (s) praising him. The contents of the Hadiths that he has narrated shows that Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) had trust in him. Furthermore, the Hadiths that he has narrated about the status of Imamate - such as: Hadith al-Ghadir , Hadiths about the virtues of the Imams and Hadiths about the attributes of Shi'a - show his deep awareness of the Shi'a Imams' right. It is said that he recognized Wilaya of the Imams and enmity towards their enemies as a condition of being Muslim. Khaythama has also quoted exegetic Hadiths from Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a), that are narrated in Tafsir al-'Ayyashi and Tafsir Furat al-Kufi . Moreover, some Sunni Rijal scholars have said that he is Thiqa (reliable). Narrators Khaythama met 13 Companions of the Prophet (s) and narrated from: 'Abd al-Rahman (his father) Imam 'Ali (a) Al-Bara' b. 'Azib Ibn 'Abbas 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr b. al-'Aas 'Adi b. Hatam al-Ta'i Nu'man b. Bashir He is also counted among the student of 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud . The following persons narrated from him: Abu Basir Ibn Muskan Sulayman b. Mihran al-A'mash 'Ali b. 'Atiyya Bakr b. Muhammad ... Demise It is said that he passed away after the battle of Jamajim and before the demise of Abu Wa'il Shaqiq b. Salama (d. 82/701-2). Although Khalifat b. Khayyat said that he passed away in 89/707-8, none of these reports are compatible with his narration from Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a).

Nevertheless, he later chose to depart from his allegiance to the Imam (a) and align himself with Mu'awiya . Nu'man, a companion of the Prophet (s) , was among the transmitters of Hadith al-Ghadir . He also served as a member of Imam 'Ali's (a) armies during the battles of Jamal and Siffin , providing support through the poems he composed. While ruling Bahrain, he distributed funds from the public treasury to the Banu Zurayq tribe, prompting the Imam (a) to write a letter cautioning him against such actions. Upon receiving the Imam's (a) letter and facing scrutiny for the misuse of the treasury, Nu'man ultimately aligned himself with Mu'awiya . Introduction and Status Imam 'Ali's (a) letter to Nu'man b. 'Ajlan: \"Anyone who neglects the duty of safeguarding entrusted responsibilities, leans towards betrayal, and neglects the purification of one's soul and faith, inflicts harm upon oneself in this world. The consequences awaiting them later [in the afterlife ] will be more bitter, enduring, severe, and prolonged. Therefore, be conscious of God. You belong to a righteous tribe, so let your behavior be that I hold positive thoughts about you; however, if the reports I have received are accurate, take the opportunity to alter my perception. Scrutinize the taxes in your jurisdiction, correspond with me, and I will share my opinion with you, God willing.\" Nu'man b. 'Ajlan al-Zuraqi belonged to the Ansar , specifically the Banu Zaurayq tribe. As a companion of the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) , he served as Imam 'Ali's (a) appointed ruler of Bahrain and Oman for a period. Nu'man held a revered status among the Ansar. Notably, he married Khawla bt. Qays, the widow of Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , following Hamza's martyrdom. In the book Ansab al-Ashraf , dating back to the third/nineth century, Nu'man is described as a staunch supporter of Ahl al-Bayt (a) against Mu'awiya . Additionally, 'Allama Amini includes him in the list of individuals who transmitted Hadith al-Ghadir. Nu'man actively participated in the battles of Jamal and Siffin as a member of Imam Ali's army. Al-Minqari , in his book Waq'a Siffin , identifies Nu'man as one of the witnesses to the events surrounding the Arbitration . Abandoning Imam Ali (a) Following the Battle of Siffin, Imam 'Ali (a) designated Nu'man as the ruler of Bahrain and Oman . However, during his tenure in Bahrain, Nu'man distributed gifts from the public treasury to the Banu Zurayq, his own tribe. The historian al-Ya'qubi , from the third/nineth century, reports that Imam 'Ali (a) addressed him in a letter, advising against such actions. Upon receiving the Imam's letter and facing scrutiny for misusing the treasury, Nu'man chose to forsake his allegiance to the Imam (a) and aligned himself with Mu'awiya . Poems in Support of Imam Ali (a) Nu'man was a poet who expressed his support for Imam 'Ali (a) through his poetic compositions, both during the Event of Saqifa and the Battle of Siffin : Ibn Abi l-Hadid in his commentary on Nahj al-balagha mentions that this poem by Nu'man was crafted as a response to a poem composed by 'Amr b. al-'As during the event of Saqifa.

Thābit b. Fākih b. Thaʿlaba b. Sāʿida al-Anṣārī (Arabic: خُزَیمَة بن ثابِت بن فاکه بن ثَعْلَبَة بن ساعدة الأنصاري ) was one of the Prophet's (s) companion and Imam 'Ali's friend. He was pioneer among the people of his tribe to convert to Islam and became the companion of the Prophet (s) . He was martyred in the Battle of Siffin . Name, Lineage, and Teknonym Khuzayma b. Thabit b. Fakih b. Tha'laba b. Sa'ida al-Ansari was from Medina , the tribe of Aws , Banu Khatma family. He was one of the great companions of the Prophet (s) and a famous friend of Imam 'Ali (a) . His mother, Kabsha, the daughter of Aws, was from Banu Sa'ida . His teknonym was Abu 'Umara. There is no report about his life before becoming Muslim. Becoming a Muslim There are disagreement about the time that he became Muslim. Some believe he became Muslim before the Battle of Badr ( 2 AH /624) and others say he became Muslim between the battles of Badr (2 AH/624) and Uhud ( 3 AH /625). After converting to Islam, by cooperating 'Umayr b. 'Uday b. Kharsha, he became agent to break the idols of his tribe. Save for the Battle of Badr, he participated in all ghazwas (battles) and also the Battle of Muta . Title Khuzayma b. Thabit is known as Dhu al-Shahadatayn; because once he testified due to a request for verification of a dealing and the Prophet (s) regarded it as the testimonies of two just witnesses which it apparently was due to Khuzayma's strong faith in the Prophet (s) and Islam. It brought him a great honor and the people of Medina , from both tribes of Aws and Khazraj , felt proud of him. The people of Ows said, \"The one whose testimony was regarded as two testimonies by the Prophet (s) is one of us\" . His testimony was about the horse of the Prophet (s) called Murtajiz. The Prophet (s) had bought it from an Arab, but he denied the dealing. Khuzayma testified for the Prophet (s). The Prophet (s) asked him, \"How do you testify while you were not with us?\" Khuzayma answered, \"I am sure that you tell nothing but the truth. How can we affirm you regarding bringing a new religion, while we do not affirm your claim about buying a horse?\" Then, the Prophet (s) said, \"Khuzayma's testimony for or against a person is a proof\" . At the Time of the Prophet (s) Khuzayma b. Thabit fought in the Battle of Uhud and the battles after it. However, the authors of maghazi (accounts of the Prophet's raids during his lifetime) have not mentioned his name in the list of the Prophet's (s) companion who fought in the Battle of Uhud, and it is said that he fought in the battles after the Battle of Uhud. 13 At the time of the Muslim conquest of Mecca , Khuzayma b. Thabit carried the flag of Banu Khatma. He took part in the Battle of Muta ( 8 AH /629). He killed a Roman soldier in this battle and took a piece of jewel as trophy. Later he sold that jewel and bought a grove of date palm instead. Refusing to Accept Caliphate of the First Caliph Some sources have reported about the presence of Khuzayma in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida . According to them he was the first lecturer in that association and said some virtues of Helpers , then asked others to pay allegiance with some one as caliph from whom Quraysh have obedience and he do not harm Helpers. Similar to some other companions of the Prophet (s) , Khuzayma b. Thabit together with the majority of Banu Hashim , acknowledged caliphate of 'Ali (a) after the Prophet (s), and refused to accept caliphate of Abu Bakr . He debated with Abu Bakr in this regard and testified that the Prophet (s) on Ghadir Khum had said, \"Whoever I am his master and authority, this 'Ali (a) will be his master and authority\" and testified that 'Ali (a) was the Prophet's (s) brother and successor. The name of Khuzayma has been mentioned among the names of 12 people who refused to accept caliphate of Abu Bakr; and each of them, in some way, wanted Abu Bakr to relinquish caliphate. His words with Abu Bakr has been recorded as follows: \"O Abu Bakr! Do you know that the Prophet (s) accepted my testimony as two testimonies?\" Abu Bakr answered, \"Yes\" Khuzayma said, \"So, I swear by God that I heard the Prophet (s) saying, 'My Ahl al-Bayt (a) make the distinction between the truth and the falsehood; and they are the leaders to be followed'.\" On the other hand, there are some records about his cooperation with Abu Bakr in the process of collecting Qur'an . There is no report about him in the events of the time of the second and third caliphs. At the time of Imam 'Ali (a) regarding the process of paying allegiance with 'Ali (a) , he introduced 'Ali (a) as the most appropriate one for caliphate , the most faithful man, the best knowing God, the closest one towards the Prophet (s) . He also composed some poetry in this regard. In the Battle of Jamal Khuzayma did an important role in the Battle of Jamal . Wearing yellow turban and white clothes, held the flag of the army, he led one thousand troopers. when Imam 'Ali (a) was blaming the heads of sedition ( Zubayr , Talha , Aisha , Ya'la b. Umayya), Khuzayma arose and called them as guilty of perjury, perfidious and lower than 'Ali (a), then he composed a poetry in this regard. Reciting paean verses, he also showed gallantry when he fought against the the enemy. In the Battle of Siffin and Martyrdom In the Battle of Siffin , Khuzayma was one of the commanders of Imam 's army. Although at that time he was an old man, with a firm belief in Imam Ali's (a) truthfulness, he fiercely fought against Mu'awiya 's army and Mu'awiya's deception did not weaken him. In the Battle of Siffin, when 'Ammar b. Yasir was martyred, Khuzayma b. Thabit went into his tent, performed his ritual bath for martyrdom . Then, he went to the battlefield and fought until he was martyred. Kuzayma's Testimony about 'Ammar b. Yasir's Murder by a Group of Oppressors Khuzayma b. Thabit has quoted from the Prophet (s) that 'Ammar b. Yasir would be killed by a group of oppressors. Khuzayma was martyred in 37 /657 in a stage of Battle of Siffin when the fight became very fierce and has become known as Yawm Waq'a al-Khamis . Imam 'Ali (a) has mentioned Khuzayma b. Thabit as one of the martyrs of Siffin and one of his brothers who remained steadfast in the right way. Therefore, according to previously mentioned traditions, this matter that Khuzayma b. Thabit did not fight in the battles of Jamal and Siffin until 'Ammar was martyred, cannot be true. Some historical narrators believe that Khuzayma b. Thabit passed away at the time of 'Uthman and the one who attended the Battle of Siffin was a person with the same name. However, according to general and specific traditions, martyrdom of Khuzayma b. Thabit in Siffin has been related by successive transmitters and denial of Khuzayma's martyrdom in Siffin is actually an attempt by the enemies to claim that those who struggled in the Battle of Badr did not side with 'Ali (a) in Siffin. Moreover, most of the historians such as Khatib Baghdadi and Ibn Abi al-Hadid have said that Dhu al-Shahadatayn was Khuzayma b. Thabit, and according to genealogical references, there was no other one called Khuzayma b. Thabit among Ansar . The belief that Khuzayma is someone other than Dhu al-Shahadatayn is actually originated from the bias propagated by Umayyads . Transmitter of Hadiths Khuzayma b. Thabit is among reliable transmitters of hadiths who has directly quoted hadiths from the Prophet (s) . Also some people have quoted from Khuzayma b. Thabit, some of whom are: 'Umara (his son) Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari 'Umara b. 'Uthman b. Hanif 'Amr b. Maymun Ibrahim b. Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas Abu 'Abd Allah al-Jadali 'Abd Allah b. Yazid al-Khatmi 'Ata' b. Yasar [37] In the collections of hadiths, 38 hadiths from the Prophet (s) have been quoted by Khuzayma b. Thabit. Composing Poems for Praising 'Ali (a) Khuzamah b. Thabit had a talent for composing poems and a large number of poems have been attributed to him. Some have counted him among Shi'a poets. Khuzayma, who was present in the events such as Saqifa Bani Sa'ida , Jamal , and Siffin , has composed many poems about Imam 'Ali (a) in which he has praised and supported him. Children of Khuzayma Khuzayma had two wives: Jamila bt. Zayd b. Khalid from the family of Banu Qawqal; Safiyya bt. 'Amir from the family of Banu Khatma His sons, 'Abd al-Rahman and 'Abd Allah, were born from Jamila and 'Umara was born from Safiyya. It is mentioned that his daughter, Dubay'a or Na'ima, composed an elegy about his father after he martyred. In his life story, such a daughter was not be mentioned, but 'Umara's daughter was called Na'ima. Ibn Funduq Ya'la b. Zayd al-Tabari (499-565/1105-6 - 1169-70), The famous historian of sixth/twelfth century, was of descendant of Khuzayma. The grave of Khuzayma is not known in Siffin.

Saʿd b. ʿUbāda al-Khazrajī (Arabic: قيس بن سعد بن عبادة الخزرجي ) (d. 60 /679-80 or 85/704-5) was among the companions of the Prophet (s) . He was the chief of Khazraj tribe and one of the agents of Imam Ali 's (a) government. He was a commander of Imam Ali's (a) army and the army of Imam al-Hasan (a) and was known for his generosity among Arabs. He participated in most battles of the time of the Prophet (s) and Imam Ali (a) and in some of them including the Battle of Siffin , he was a commander and the standard-bearer. He was appointed by Imam Ali (a) as the agent in Egypt and then in Azerbaijan . During the time of Imam al-Hasan (a) , Qays was one of his commanders who, based on reports, did not agree with Imam (a) about his peace with Mu'awiya . There are hadiths he narrated from the Prophet (s). 'Allama Amini counted him among the poets of the Event of Ghadir . Name, Teknonym and Lineage Biographers have recorded the name of Qays's father as Sa'd b. 'Ubada b. Dalim b. Abi Halima. Qays was called al-Khazraji because of his father's lineage in Khazraj tribe of Medina . His brother Sa'id was also among transmitters of the hadith of Ghadir and the agents of Imam Ali's (a) government. His Kunya was Abu l-Fadl, Abu 'Abd Allah or Abu 'Abd al-Malik and his mother was Fakiha bt. 'Ubayd b. Dalim b. Haritha. Genealogists praised him for his intelligence and wisdom as he was excellent in war solutions. It is reported that he said about himself, \"If the Prophet (s) did not say that the place for [applying] deception is hellfire, I would become the most deceitful and conniving Arab man.\" Moral Qualities Qays, his father and his grandfather were chiefs of their tribe and were regarded among the most generous of Arabs. It is narrated from the Prophet (s), \"Qays is from the families of generosity.\" It is said that his father was always accompanying the Prophet (s) and sent food for him at the times of the meals every day. According to al-Waqidi, when in the Battle of Ghaba, the Prophet (s) was away from Medina , Sa'd sent Qays to the Prophet (s) with some dates. The Prophet (s) became happy when he (s) saw Qays coming on the horse and admired him and his father. People of Khazraj who were with the Prophet (s), told him that they had always supported people in difficulties and then the Prophet (s) said, \"the good ones among you in Islam are the good ones among you at the time of Ignorance, just if they acquire understanding in the religion of God.\" Al-Waqidi has reported that in Sariyya of Khabt, when the army of Islam faced hunger and lack of food, Qays generously bought some calves and goats on his credit and relieved the army of Islam from hunger for some days. When he returned to Medina, his father paid the debt to him and gave him many things and following this event, the Prophet (s) praised Qays and his family for their generosity. During the Time of the Prophet (s) Qays has probably been young at the time of the Prophet (s). Upon the conquest of Mecca , he was the standard-bearer of the Prophet (s). The famous hadith from the Prophet (s) saying, \"if the knowledge is in Pleiades, people from Persia will acquire it\", has been narrated by Qays. During the Time of the Three Caliphs Qays was present in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida ; but, at the time of the Three Caliphs, he did not interfere in the affairs and there is no much information about him from that period. In some sources, there are reports about his sharp encounter with the first and second caliphs. For example, it is said that when Bashir b. Sa'd, as the chief of Aws , gave allegiance to Abu Bakr in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida; due to the pressure of the people of Aws for giving allegiance, Sa'd b. 'Ubada shouted, \"you are about to kill me!\". 'Umar b. Khattab said, \"Kill Sa'd! May God kill him!\" So, Qays attacked him, but Abu Bakr calmed 'Umar down. At the Time of Imam Ali (a) Imam Ali (a) appointed Qays b. Sa'd as the governor of Egypt in 36 /656-7. Some have reported that at his time, Mu'awiya lost his control over Egypt and he had to push Qays out of Egypt with deception. So, he spread this rumor that Qays was with him in taking revenge for the blood of 'Uthman (see: Shirt of 'Uthman ) and when the rumor was spread, Imam Ali (a) dismissed Qays from the government of Egypt. Some other sources have mentioned that since the time Qays was appointed as the governor of Egypt, Mu'awiya wrote letters to him and though threatening and persuasion tried to force Qays accompany him but he was not successful and in his last letter, threatened Qays seriously. Then, he wrote a fake letter which suggested that Qays had accepted to accompany him. He recited the letter to people in Syria . Imam Ali (a) heard the rumor about Qays accompanying Mu'awiya, but he (a) did not believe it, but consulted with Imam al-Hasan (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) and 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far . 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far advised him to dismiss Qays, but Imam Ali (a) did not want to dismiss Qays because Imam (a) considered him loyal until he (a) received some letters from Qays in which he had written that he did not consider it wise to put pressure on those in Egypt who had not given allegiance to Imam Ali (a). In response, Imam Ali (a) insisted that they needed to make their choice whether they were with the official caliph of Muslims or they are with Mu'awiya and Qays had to take their allegiance. In a letter to Imam Ali (a), Qays openly disobeyed this order with this excuse that those people were peace-seeking and were not going to make war or any trouble. Thus, Imam Ali (a) dismissed him from the government of Egypt. Afterwards, Qays first went to Medina and according to some sources, he was upset from Imam Ali (a) because of being dismissed from the government of Egypt, but he was bothered by the agents of Mu'awiya who were in Medina and therefore went to Kufa after a while. Presence in Battles Qays accompanied Imam Ali (a) in all his battles. According to some sources, at the beginning of the Battle of Jamal , Qays urged Imam (a) to resist and mobilized the Helpers for helping Imam (a). After Imam Ali (a) dismissed Qays from the government of Egypt, appointed him as the governor of Azerbaijan . On the verge of the Battle of Jamal, Imam (a) wrote a letter to Qays and told him to appoint 'Abd Allah b. Shumayl al-Ahmasi in his place and he goes to Kufa. Thus, he participated in the Battle of Siffin as one of the top commanders of Imam Ali (a). In this battle, he showed great valor. It is said that in this battle, Imam Ali (a) gave him the flag of the Prophet (s) . In the Battle of Nahrawan , Imam Ali (a) sent Qays and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari to Khawarij to prevent the battle. At the Time of Imam al-Hasan (a) It is said that Qays was the first person who gave allegiance to Imam al-Hasan (a) in 40 /661. During the time of Imam al-Hasan (a), Qays was one of his commanders and it is said that he did not agree with Imam's (a) peace with Mu'awiya. When he received the letter of Imam al-Hasan (a) regarding the peace with Mu'awiya, he told people that they had a choice to war out of the obedience of Imam (a) or to give allegiance to Mu'awiya. And people chose to give allegiance to Mu'awiya. In al-Ghadir , 'Allama Amini has mentioned the name of Qays among the poets of the Event of Ghadir in the 1st/ 7th century . Death There are different views about the time of Qays's death and place of his burial. The date of his death has been mentioned to be the last year of Mu'awiya's caliphate either in 85/704-5 or 60/679-80. In al-Isti'ab , Medina has been mentioned as the place of his burial and in al-Zirkili's al-A'lam , Tbilisi has been mentioned as the place of his burial. According to the latter report, Qays escaped to Tbilisi out of his fear from Mu'awiya in 58/677-8 and in 85/704-5 he died when 'Abd al-Malik b. Marwan was ruling.

{"title": "Barzakh", "text": " Barzakh (Arabic: بَرزَخ ) is a world between this world and hereafter ; it is also called the imaginal world or the world of grave . Brazakh exists for both believers and non-believers, though it is similar to the Heaven for the former, and similar to the Hell for non-believers. Meaning 'Barzakh' in Arabic literally means an interval or a barrier between two things, and technically it means an interval between the end of this-worldly life (death) and the beginning of hereafter. The world is called 'Barzakh' because it is an interval between this world and the hereafter. The world is also called the world of grave and the imaginal world. In the Qur'an The word 'Barzakh' has been mentioned three times in the Qur'an . but only in Qur'an 23 :100 it has been used in the meaning in question: “ حَتَّى إِذَا جَاء أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ (۹۹) لَعَلِّی أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِیمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّا إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَائِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى یوْمِ یبْعَثُونَ \"When death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord! Take me back (99) that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.' 'By no means! These are mere words that he says.' And ahead of them is a Barzakh until the day they will be resurrected.\" ” — Qur'an, Qur'an 23:99-100 According to this verse of the Qur'an, the request of some people at the time of their death to return to the world in order to do the good deeds that they have not done is not in place, and they face a barrier or an interval—a Barzakh—until the Day of Judgment . The phrase \"until the day they will be resurrected\" indicates that Barzakh is an interval between this world and the hereafter, that anyone experiences after their death and before the Day of Judgment. Proof in the Qur'an In addition to verse 100 of Qur'an 23 that explicitly shows the existence of Barzakh, some verses prove Barzakh without mentioning the word 'Barzakh'. These verses concern the life of martyrs after their deaths: And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their lord. [5] And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive. [6] Moreover, according to Qur'anic verses, Barzakh is not restricted to martyrs—a sinner like Pharaoh and his friends also experience Barzakh: In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the day that judgment will be established: 'cast ye the people of pharaoh into the severest penalty! ( Qur'an 23 :46) [7] The verse obviously points to a penalty for Pharaoh and his people before the penalties of the Day of Judgment, and that is the penalty in Barzakh. In Hadiths Definition In some hadiths , the word 'Barzakh' is used to mean an interval between this world and the hereafter. For instance, according a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , all (true) Shiites will go to the Heaven in the hereafter, and, the hadith goes on, 'I swear to God that I fear about you in Barzakh'. A person asked him about Barzakh, and Imam answered: '[it is] the grave, from one's death to the Day of Judgment'. This latter statement implies that the world of grave is the world of Barzakh —indeed, grave in this hadith does not mean a certain hole in the earth; it is a metaphor for Barzakh. Barzakh's Heaven and Hell Some hadiths state that the world of Barzakh has its own heaven and hell in which people are rewarded or punished for their deeds. The Prophet (s) says: \"the grave is either a garden of heaven or a hole of hell\". Question of the Grave A number of hadiths show that once people enter the world of Barzakh, they are questioned about their beliefs and deeds. This questioning is known as \"the question of the grave\". Barzakhi Body Human soul attaches to an imaginal or Barzakhi body. An imaginal body is one that is not of a material kind, and yet enjoys some characteristics of material objects, such as shape and size. In these respects, the imaginal body is like a person's natural body. In order to have a clear picture of an imaginal or Barzakhi body, one might reflect on the forms or images that one observes while dreaming. Such forms are undoubtedly non-material; they do not occupy any space and they do not have any mass, and yet they have a shape and a size and they have forms like those of material objects.

Place of Birth Ray (Isfahan ) or Ramhurmuz Place(s) of Residence Isfahan , Syria , Medina , Al-Madain Death/Martyrdom 36 / 656 - 7 Burial Place Al-Madain , Iraq Religious Information Conversion to Islam Jumada I , 1 /November/December, 622 Salmān al-Fārsī (Arabic: سلمان الفارسي ) (b. ? - d. 36 / 656 - 7 ) was a companion of prophet Muhammad (s) and of Imam Ali (a) . The Prophet (s) liked him and said about him, \"Salman is one of us, the Ahl al-Bayt\". His idea of digging a trench in the Battle of Khandaq brought victory to Muslims. He supported the successorship of Imam 'Ali (a) after the demise of the Prophet (s) and opposed the incident of Saqifa . He was assigned as the governor of al-Madain in the time of the caliphate of Umar b. al-Khattab . He gave his salary to charity and knitted baskets for a living. After a long life, Salman passed away in 36 /656-7 in al-Madain, where he is buried in a shrine known as \"Salman-i Pak\". Based on some reports, Salman was a Zoroastrian Iranian whose original name was Ruzbih. He converted to Christianity in his youth. After hearing the Christians foretelling the emergence of a prophet in the land of Arabs, he set off toward Hijaz . He was enslaved in the middle of the way and sold to a man from Banu Qurayza in Medina . He entered Medina when prophet Muhammad (s) had recently emigrated to the city. Salman met the Prophet (s) and after confirming the signs of prophethood converted to Islam . The Prophet (s) bought and freed him and named him \"Salman\". Before Conversion to Islam Salman's original name was Ruzbih (Farsi: روزبه ) and his father's name has been mentioned as Khushfudan (Farsi: خشفودان ) and, based on a report, as Budhakhshan (Farsi: بوذخشان ). According to traditions, after his conversion to Islam, he was given the name Salman by the Holy Prophet (s). His teknonym was Abu 'Abd Allah. He was born either in Jay district of Isfahan or, based on some reports, in Ramhurmuz . His father was an Iranian elite landholder (Dehqan). Reports about his pre-Islamic life is mixed with tale-telling. What has been emphasized in these traditions is his inquisitive mindset that inspired him to embark on a long journey in search of a better religion. According to these reports, Salman was a Zoroastrian in childhood until he became familiar with and converted to Christianity. He moved to Syria to study under leading Christian scholars. Based on reports, Salman's father loved him so much that he would confine him in the house. Therefore, his journey to Syria was deemed as a kind of escape. In Syria, he served in the churches and traveled to Mosul , Nusaybin and Amuriyya. From Amuriyya, Salman headed toward Hijaz . This trip was inspired by the news of a prophet emerging in that land about which Salman was informed by his Christian masters. He accompanied a caravan from the Banu Kalb tribe in which he was captured and sold as a slave to a Jew from Banu Qurayza and was taken to Medina . Conversion to Islam Salman converted to Islam in Jumada I , 1 /Nov-Dec, 622 , . Salman had heard of a prophet who won't accept any charity ( sadaqa ) food, but he accepts gifts, and he has the seal of prophethood between his shoulders. Thus, when he met Muhammad (s) in Quba, he gave some food he had collected as charity to the Prophet Muhammad (s), the Prophet (s) gave all of it to his companions, and he did not eat any from it. Another time, Salman gave some food to the Prophet (s) as a gift, and then he noticed prophet Muhammad (s) ate some of it. And at the third time, he saw the Prophet Muhammad (s) in a funeral of his friend, where he finally saw the seal between the Prophet's shoulders. After that Salman went down on his knees in front of the Prophet (s) and praised him, and then he converted to Islam. Freedom The Prophet Muhammad (s) bought Salman (who was a slave) for planting three hundred date trees and six hundred silver coins, and then he freed him from slavery. As Salman said, the Prophet Muhammad (s) had bought him and then named him Salman. The document of freedom of Salman was dictated by the Prophet and it was written by Ali b. Abi Talib (a) : The Prophet Muhammad (s) has paid three hundred date trees and six hundred silver coins to Uthman b. al-Ashhal al-Yahudi; therefore, Salman's ransom is paid and he belongs to Prophet Muhammad (s) and his family, whereas no one else has authority over him. Bond of Brotherhood According to some sources, the bond of brotherhood was made between Salman and Abu l-Darda' . While some other reports mentioned Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman , and some others mentioned Miqdad b. 'Amr . However, Shi'a narrations mostly have accepted the bond was made between Salman and Abu Dhar . In addition, some sources stated the condition that Abu Dhar was supposed to follow Salman. In the Words of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) , vol. 9, p. 117 According to most of Shi'i sources, the first day that Salman entered the mosque, people respected and praised him, while some other people disapproved of it, because he was an 'Ajam (non-Arab). After this event, Prophet Muhammad (s) gave a speech to people: Men are not superior to another based on their race (being Arab or non-Arab) or the color of their skin, but only piety differentiates them. Salman is a vast sea and an everlasting treasure. Salman is a member of my family (Ahl al-Bayt). He is gifted with knowledge and wisdom. The same statement of the Prophet has also been narrated in another report. Based on this report, during the days when people of Medina were busy digging a trench to confront their enemy, the army of al-Ahzab, Salman al-Farsi who was a strong man played a prominent role in the fulfillment of the task, therefore, Migrants and Helpers each considered him a member of their respective group then the Prophet (s) said that Salman is one of us, the Ahl al-Bayt. Other hadiths have been narrated from the Prophet (s) praising Salman including a statement to the fact that the heaven is eager to have Ali , Ammar , and Salman or a hadith based on which God has obliged the Prophet (s) to like Ali, Salman, Miqdad , and Abu Dhar. In Shiite sources, there are hadiths narrated from Imams (a) praising Slaman. In these hadiths, he is generally considered among the first Shiites who are steadfast in faith. Among these hadiths, there is a statement by Imam Ali (a) in which Salman and some other companions such as Abu Dhar, Ammar, and Miqdad have been considered among those for whose blessings, God grants sustenance to people. Imam Ali (a) has also considered Salman as having the knowledge of the first and the last. In a hadith narrated from Imam al-Baqir (a) and Imam al-Sadiq (a) , it is stated that once in a meeting with Imam (a), Salman al-Farsi's name was mentioned and Imam (a) said not to mention his name as al-Farsi but mention him as Salman al-Muhammadi since he is one of us, Ahl al-Bayt. Important Activities In Battles Salman participated in all the battles of Muslims after the Battle of Khandaq . Before the Battle of Khandaq, Salman proposed the idea of digging a trench around the city, Medina which led to the victory of Muslims. According to some sources in the Battle of Tai'f he proposed to use catapult and the Prophet (s) ordered it to be used. Umar b. al-Khattab assigned Salman and Hudhayfa as the commanders of the Muslim army in the Conquest of Iran . In the conquest of al-Madain, he was the negotiator of the Muslims with the commanders of the Iranian forces. Disagreement with the Event of Saqifa In the Event of Saqifa, Salman said: , Vol. 1, P. 591 Salman disagreed with the Event of Saqifa . Miqdad , Salman, Abu Dhar , Ubada b. Samit , Abu l-Haytham b. al-Tayyihan , Hudhayfa , and Ammar b. Yasir gathered around at the night after the Event of Saqifa to decide on Caliphate in the community of Muhajirun . Salman and Ubayy b. Ka'b had numerous reasons to disagree with the Event of Saqifa. The famous sentence of Salman on those sahaba of Prophet (s) who took an oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was: \"You did and you did not\" Which means you chose a Caliph, but refused to accept the Prophet Muhammad's order. He said in the day, you chose an elder man, but you left the family of Prophet Muhammad (s) alone; if you had chosen a member of Ahl al-Bayt , there would not be any conflict. And also you would have enjoyed its blessings. Governor of al-Madain Salman al-Farsi became the governor of al-Madain in the time of Umar b. al-Khattab . Salman had asked for permission of Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and then he accepted it. He was the governor of al-Madain until he passed away. Salman dedicated the money he received as the governor to charity. He covered his expenses by means of knitting baskets. Family Salman had two unsuccessful attempts to get married. The first one was asking the daughter of Umar, the sister of Hafsa (Prophet Muhammad's wife). At first Umar disagreed but after Prophet Muhammad (s) mentioned the status and position of Salman among Muslims, he accepted his request. However, Salman retracted his request afterward. In the second attempt, Salman sent Abu l-Darda' to ask the hand of a girl for marriage, whose family did not accept the request of Salman; however, they claimed they would accept Abu l-Darda' as their son-in-law. Accordingly, Abu l-Darda' married her later. Salman eventually married Buqayra from the tribe of Banu Kinda. Abd Allah and Muhammad were the names of their sons. Abd Allah had narrated the hadith of the Heavenly Gift for the Lady Fatima (s) . Salman also had a daughter in Isfahan and two other daughters in Egypt. According to Muhaddith Nuri , the descendants of Salman were living in Rey for about five hundred years. Badr al-Din al-Hasan b. Ali b. Salman was a prominent figure in the narration of hadith and his lineage goes back to Salman al-Farsi through nine generations. Dia' al-Din al-Farsi (d. 622/1225-6), a descendant of Salman, was a grand scholar and a poet in Khujand. He was a religious leader in Bukhara . He also penned a commentary on al-Mahsul by al-Razi . Muhaddith Nuri also mentioned Shams al-Din Suzani (d. 562/1166-7 or 569/1173-4) as a descendant of Salman, he was titled as Taj al-Shu'ara (the Crown of Poets). The other mentioned descendants of Salman are Abd al-Fattah, custodian of the mausoleum of Salman for some time; Abu Kathir b. Abd al-Rahman, grandchild of Salman who narrated the letter of Prophet Muhammad (s) to Abd al-Ashhal, a Jewish member of Banu Qurayza , on freedom of Salman; Ibrahim b. Shahriyar (d. 624.1226-7), known as Abu Ishaq Kaziruni, who was a religious figure in the fifth/eleventh century and al-Hasan b. al-Hasan whose lineage goes back to Muhammad b. Salman. Demise Salman passed away in 36 /656-7. In some sources it is mentioned that he had a long life and even some have considered his lifespan 350 years. Salman had written this poem on his enshrouding cotton: I am heading toward the Munificent, lacking a sound heart and an appropriate provision While taking a provision (with you) is the most dreadful deed, if you are going to the Munificent After Salman had passed away, Ali b. Abi Talib (a) travelled to al-Madain to perform ghusl on his body and enshroud it, and then he performed funeral prayer on his body, before burying him in a grave. Imam 'Ali (a) returned to Medina that night.

She immigrated to Abyssinia together with Muslims and was the first person who immigrated to Medina . She loved Imam al-Husayn (a) very much and after his martyrdom , mourned for him. She accepted Islam in the first years of the Bi'tha and immigrated to Abyssinia with a group of Muslims led by Ja'far b. Abi Talib following the order of the Prophet (s). In 4 /625, after her husband died, she married the Prophet (s). Most historians have mentioned that she passed away after the Event of 'Ashura . Name and Lineage Her name was Hind, but she was called Umm Salama since she had a son whose name was Salama. The name of her father was Abu Umayya b. Mughira and the name of her mother was 'Atikah . Some sources have said that her mother was a daughter of 'Abd al-Muttalib , but most historians believe that she was a daughter of 'Amir b. Rabi'a al-Kinani . There is no information about the date of her birth. Conversion to Islam Before marrying the Prophet (s) , Umm Salama was the wife of the Prophet's (s) step brother, Abu Salama b. 'Abd al-Asad al-Makhzumi . She became Muslim together with her husband in Mecca . Immigration to Abyssinia Umm Salama and her husband joined the group of Muslims who immigrated to Abyssinia . All hadiths related to Quraysh delegates in Abyssinia and their debates with Ja'far b. Abi Talib in the presence of king of Abyssinia are narrated by Umm Salama. Ibn Hisham narrated the story of entering emigrants to Abyssinia and the kind encounter of the king of Abyssinia with them from Umm Salama. Immigration to Medina Following the Prophet's (s) order for immigration of Muslims to Medina , the first person who immigrated was Abu Salama who went to Medina with his son and his wife but Banu Mughira , who were relatives of Umm Salama prevented them from going to Medina. Umm Salama narrated her story of separating from her son and husband that, \"I used to cry days and nights for one year and went and stood on the way to Medina and asked about them from anyone coming from Medina. When my relatives saw my distress, they let me travel to Medina and I traveled to Medina after one year.\" In Medina Marriage with the Prophet (s) After Abu Salama , 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Asad passed away in 4 /625-6 due to a wound from the Battle of Uhud , Umm Salama married the Prophet (s). Before, the Prophet (s) asked Umm Salama for marriage, Abu Bakr and then 'Umar did, but she did not accept. Then, the Prophet (s) asked her for marriage and she accepted. Umm Salama had virtues which made Aisha envious and upset. Participation in Battles and Sariyyas Umm Salama participated in many battles and Sariyyas such as al-Muraysi' , Khaybar , Hudaybiyya , Khandaq , Conquest of Mecca and Hunayn . Later, she went to the battlefield of Uhud every month and sent Salutation upon the martyrs. Relation with the Ahl al-Bayt (a) Umm Salama always tried to be with the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . According to reports, after the Prophet (s) passed away, Umm Salama was one of the defenders of the Ahl al-Bayt (a), so that she defended Lady Fatima (a) against Abu Bakr regarding the Prophet's (s) inheritance for Lady Fatima (a) and that year she was deprived of it. Battle of Jamal After 'Uthman's murder, when Talha and Zubayr went to Mecca and encouraged Aisha to wage war against Ali (a) , Aisha too wanted to incite Umm Salama to participate in such a war, but she did not accept it and prohibited Aisha from that. When she was disappointed from stopping Aisha, informed Imam Ali (a) about the intentions of the Companions of Jamal (Aisha, Talha, and Zubayr) and sent her son 'Umar b. Abi Salama to him. Later, Imam Ali (a) appointed this man as the governor of Bahrain , then the governor of Fars , and in another account, as the governor of Hulwan , Mah, and Masbadhan. Love for Imam al-Husayn (a) Her love for the Ahl al-Bayt (a) was to such an extent that she was assigned to take care of Imam al-Husayn (a) in childhood; and after his martyrdom by Yazid , she mourned a lot for Imam al-Husayn (a). Role in the Event of Karbala Before traveling to Karbala , Imam al-Husayn (a) trusted the Prophet's (s) standard and weapon as the Trusts of Imamate to her to keep them safe. This shows her special position before Ahl al-Bayt (a) . According to some reports, the Prophet (s) had given a little of the soil of Karbala and she kept it in a jar. The Prophet (s) had told her that, \"when you saw that this soil turned to blood, my son al-Husayn (a) is martyred. One day, she dreamt the Prophet (s) with a sad face and wearing dusty clothes and he (s) told her, \"we are coming from the burial of the martyrs.\" She just woke up and went to that jar and found it bloody and learned that Husayn (a) was martyred. Then, she began crying and mourning and when neighbors came, she told them the story. This story is known as the Hadith of Qarura . Opposition against Mu'awiya After Imam al-Hasan (a) accepted peace with Mu'awiya , Umm Salama advised her nephew and Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari to accept allegiance with Mu'awiya in order to keep their lives. But Jabir would not keep silent and after Mu'awiya issued an order that speakers had to curse Imam Ali (a) on pulpits in mosques , Jabir wrote a letter to Mu'awiya and severely admonished him. Demise There is disagreement on the year of her demise, as it has been reported between 59 /678-9 to 62 /681-2; but it seems that 62/681-2 could be most accurate; since she was alive after the martyrdom of Imam al-Husayn (a) . Therefore she was the last wife of the Prophet (s) who passed away. It has been reported by her son, 'Umar, that she was 84 years old when she passed away. Her grave is located in al-Baqi' cemetery beside the graves of other noble Muslims of the early Islam. Musnad of Umm Salama Umm Salama narrated many hadiths from the Prophet (s) which are recorded in hadith references of both Shi'a and Sunni . The Number of her hadiths are 378 which collected in a collection called Musnad of Umm Salama . Unfortunately, there is no list of her hadiths in Shi'a hadith references. Her hadiths include: The cause of revelation of the Verse of Taṭhir [27] Hadith al-Kisa' [28] The Prophet's (s) hadith regarding the events of Karbala and the martyrdom of Imam al-Husayn (a) [29] Umm Salama also narrated hadiths from Abu Salama b. 'Abd al-Asad and Lady Fatima (a) and many people have learned hadiths from her and have transmitted them whose names are recorded in hadith references. Trustworthiness When Imam al-Husayn (a) went out of Medina towards Mecca , he (a) trusted the Trusts of Imamate to Umm Salama. After Imam al-Sajjad (a) returned from Karbala , Umm Salama gave Imam Ali's (a) books of knowledge, Signs and possessions of Imams (a) trusted to her to Imam al-Sajjad (a) and this is a good proof of her trustworthiness of Umm Salama before Imams (a).

Malik Validity of the chain of transmission Tawatur of the Content Shi'a sources 'Uyun akhbar al-Rida (a) • Al-Amali (by al-Saduq) • Al-Amali (by al-Tusi) Sunni sources Al-Mustadrak • Manaqib Ibn al-Maghazili Ḥadīth al-Safīna (the narration of the ark) is a famous hadith narrated from Prophet Muhammad (s) . In this Hadith, the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet are likened to Noah 's Ark. The Hadith is counted as one of the narrative proofs of the special situation of the Prophet's household in guidance and leadership of Muslims . Text According to the narration of Abu Dhar al-Ghifari from the Prophet (s), the hadith reads: “ إِنَّمَا مَثَلُ أَهْلِ بَیتِی فِیکُمْ کَمَثَلِ سَفِینَةِ نُوحٍ، مَنْ دَخَلَهَا نَجَی، وَ مَنْ تَخَلَّفَ عَنْهَا غَرِقَ The example of my household among you is like Noah's Ark, whoever boards it will survive and whoever misses it will drown. ” Hadith al-Safina is narrated through about 50 chains of transmission in various hadith collections with slightly different words, in a way that has reached the level of Tawatur of the Content . The Hadith is narrated by six infallible Imams (a) ( Imam Ali , Imam al-Hasan , Imam al-Sajjad , Imam al-Baqir , Imam al-Sadiq and Imam al-Rida (a)), some Sahabas (the Companions of the Prophet (s)) ( Abu Dhar , Miqdad , Abu Sa'id al-Khudri , Ibn Abbas , Anas b. Malik , Salama b. Akwa' , Abd Allah b. Zubayr and Abu Musa Ash'ari ) and a group of Tabi'un (the Followers). Importance Shi'a scholars paid a special attention to this Hadith as a proof of the rightfulness of Ahl al-Bayt (a). 'Allama Sharaf al-Din has mentioned this Hadith as the second proof for their rightfulness in his book, al-Muraji'at . The Hadith is used as evidence for proving the following points: Necessity of obedience and adherence: In this Hadith, Ahl al-Bayt (a) are introduced as a means of salvation; to obey the means of salvation is necessary to attain salvation. Thus, it is necessary to obey Ahl al-Bayt (a) [18] . Infallibility of Ahl al-Bayt (a): if someone whose obedience is obligatory is fallible, there will be no guarantee that he does not make any mistakes in his guidance. While in the Hadith, salvation through Ahl al-Bayt (a) has been guaranteed. Therefore, Ahl al-Bayt (a) must be infallible [19] . Superiority of Ahl al-Bayt (a): If there were other people who were superior to Ahl al-Bayt (a), they should have been mentioned in the Hadith as the rescue ark [20] . Affection for Ahl al-Bayt (a): Entering the rescue ark without having affection for Ahl al-Bayt (a) is not possible [21] . Sunni Sources Having narrated this Hadith in his book al-Mustadrak from Abu Dhar, al-Hakim al-Nayshaburi explicitly says that based on Muslim al-Nayshaburi 's criteria this Hadith is Sahih , i.e. this Hadith is similar to other Hadiths mentioned by Muslim in his book Sahih , which is the second most reliable Hadith collection in Sunni school of thought. After narrating this Hadith from early sources, Sayyid Ali Milani has mentioned that Sunni Muslims have counted it as a Sahih Hadith . As Abu Dhar held the door of Ka'ba while narrating this Hadith, al-Tayyibi believes that this act is an emphasis on the authenticity of it and his appearance publicly and especially, in Masjid al-Haram shows the importance of this Hadith to Abu Dhar, and that he wanted to draw the attention of the public to it. Al-Tayyibi adds that in another narration Abu Dhar introduced him in the beginning by saying \"who knows me, knows me; and who does not, I am Abu Dhar. I heard the Prophet ….\" By introducing himself, he wanted to remind people of another Hadith from the Prophet (s) about himself: \"There is no one under the sky and on the earth more truthful than Abu Dhar.\" In Hadith al-Safina the Prophet of God (s) has mentioned this ark as the only way for redemption of this world and its seductions . Al-Samhudi writes in al-Jawahir al-'iqdayn that the ark of Ahl al-Bayt (a) will rescue those who board it as Noah 's Ark did. The Hadith wants to encourage people to hold firmly to the rope of Ahl al-Bayt (a), honor them and have affection for them . Likewise, al-Manawi writes in his book Fayd al-qadir that Ahl al-Bayt (a) were likened to Noah's Ark as they rescue and guide people, i.e. as the people who were on Noah's Ark survived and were rescued, the salvation of the Islamic nation depends on adherence to Ahl al-Bayt (a); for they are the leaders and bright lights of guidance .

Its authenticity and the explicit mention of the names of true successors of the Prophet (s) , has placed it among the significant evidences to prove Shi'a Imams' Imama and their rightful immediate successor-ship after the Prophet (s). The well-known version of this hadith is narrated form the famous companion of the Prophet (s), Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari . The Lawh (Tablet) on which this Hadith is engraved, was descended from Heaven to the Prophet (s) as a gift for the birth of his second grandson, Imam al-Husayn (a) . As a present, the Prophet (s) gave this Tablet to his daughter, Lady Fatima al-Zahra (a). The Hadith of Lawh, has been reported in different accounts, with slight differences in the phrasing and the length. The Famous Version The famous version of Hadith of Lawh, which has been narrated by Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari is as follows: Muhammad b. Yahya and Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah narrated from: 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far from Hasan b. Zarif and 'Ali b. Muhammad from Salih b. Abi Hammad, from Bakr b. Salih, from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Salim from Abu Basir , from Imam al-Sadiq (a) who said: One day my father, Muhammad b. 'Ali al-Baqir (a) , told Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari \"O' Jabir! I have something to tell you, what time is suitable for you so I can talk to you?\" \"Whenever you wish\" Jabir replied. So in a proper occasion, they gathered together and talked. In this session, the Imam wanted Jabir to tell him about the Lawh that he once had seen with his grandmother, Lady Fatima (a) , and narrate for the Imam what she had told Jabir about the inscriptions of that Tablet. \"I testify that\" Jabir started, \"during the lifetime of the Prophet (s) I visited your (grand)mother to congratulate her on the birth of her son, Husayn, there I saw a green Tablet in her hands which I thought had been made of emerald. There was a bright inscription on that tablet which was shining like the sunlight. I told her holiness 'may my parents be your sacrifice, what is this tablet?' she said: 'this is a tablet which Allah , the exalted one, has gifted to his Apostle (s). In this tablet, the names of my father, my husband, my two sons and the Imams who are form my descendants have been listed. My father, the Prophet of Allah (s), has given it to me so that my heart feels happy and pleased whenever I look at it.\" Here Jabir Added \"then your (grand)mother gave the tablet to me and I read its inscription and made a copy of it.\" Then Imam al-Sadiq (a) continues the Hadith. Different Versions the Hadith of Lawh, has been narrated in different reports, with slight differences in the phrasing and the length. All of these different accounts can be summarized in five versions: The famous version, referred to independently as the Hadith of Law, narrated extensively by al-Shaykh al-Kulayni in al-Kafi ; al-Shaykh al-Saduq in Kamal al-Din . [2] The second narrative: in this account, at first, a part of the hadith is narrated by Imam al-Baqir (a) for Jabir and then Jabir continues. The rest is reported by Imam al-Baqir (a) from Jabir who had said: \"one day I went to the house of my Mawla, Lady Fatima (a) , with whom I found a very shiny tablet that kept my eyes staring fixedly because of its brightness. I could spot twelve names on that Lawh. Three names at the middle, three at the bottom and three at the margin.\" Jabir further added: \"I had a look at that tablet and I recognized three positions on which it was written: Muhammad, Muhammad, Muhammad; and four positions on which it was written: 'Ali, 'Ali, 'Ali, 'Ali. The third account is a report by Ishaq b. 'Ammar from Imam al-Sadiq (a) in which the Imam tells him: \"O' Ishaq, do you want me to give you good news?\" Ishaq said: \"may I be your sacrifice, O' son of the Apostle of Allah, yes I do like to hear the good news.\" Imam then said: \"we have a script, dictated by the Holy Prophet (s) and written by Imam 'Ali (a) , it bears: In the Name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful. This is a letter from Allah, the all-Mighty, the all-Wise, to Muhammad, his Prophet and his light and his apostle … the rest of the hadith is like the first account and there's no mention of Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansar and the report is not narrated by him. The report of Fadl b. Shadhan from the Hadith of Lawh. Fadl b. Shadhan reports the hadith with his particular chain of transmission. The hadith is narrated by Abu Khalid al-Kabuli . Abu Khalid saw the tablet with Imam al-Sajjad (a) that had been gifted by Allah to his Apostle (s) and contained the name of the Prophet (s) and the names of his successors. The fifth narrative: the report from Imam al-Sadiq (a) in Kamal al-Din of al-Shaykh al-Saduq. According to this account, Imam al-Baqir (a) gathers his sons and his brother, Zayd b. 'Ali , and shows them a scroll which is dictated by the Prophet (s) and the handwriting of Imam 'Ali (a) and bears the content of Lady Fatima's Lawh. There's no mention of Jabir and his report in this account. Authenticity The Hadith of Lawh is among the narrations that have been reported in authentic Shi'a sources. Also, there are contextual indications that affirm its authenticity and increase its value. Thiqat al-Islam al-Kulayni reports this hadith in al-Kafi through a trustworthy chain of transmission. Additionally, other scholars have considered this Hadith authentic and reported it in their collections with the same chain of transmission or other chains. Al-Nu'mani in al-Ghayba ; al-Shaykh al-Saduq in 'Uyun akhbar al-Rida (a) and Kamal al-Din ; al-Shaykh al-Mufid in al-Ikhtisas and al-Shaykh al-Tusi in al-Ghayba have reported this hadith. Also, in other sources like: al-Ihtijaj , Irshad al-qulub , Ta'wil al-ayat , Taqrib al-ma'arif , Fada'il of Fadl b. Shadhan , Manaqib of Ibn Shahrashub , Kashf al-ghumma , al-Fusul al-mukhtara , al-Sirat al-mustaqim and al-Irshad of al-Shaykh al-Mufid , this hadith has been reported, partly or entirely, sometimes without mentioning its chain of transmission. Notable Points in the Hadith The divine precedent in appointing successors for previous Prophets (a): according to this hadith , Allah says: \"I have not sent any apostle but when he finished his days (lifetime), I appointed for him a successor.\" In fact, the divine custom of appointing a successor ( Wisaya ) started from Prophet Adam (a) and continued to the final Prophet (s). In a similar long hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , it has been said that all the Prophets had divinely appointed successors. The names of some of these successors have also been mentioned. The Commander of the Faithful (a) is the best of Awsiya (divinely appointed successors): the supremacy of Imam 'Ali (a) among all other divinely appointed successors of the previous prophets is a fact that has been stated in various narrations. Continuity of Imama through the lineage of Imam al-Husayn (a) : according to the explanations of al-Majlisi , it can be concluded that what has been meant by the word: ( الکلمة التامة ) al-Kalima al-Tamma (the complete word) and ( الحجة البالغة ) al-Hujjat al-Baligha (the ultimate evidence) and their association with Imam al-Husayn (a) by Allah, is the affairs of Imama. \"I have placed my complete word and my ultimate evidence with him (al-Husayn).\" The two mentioned features are correspondents to different aspects of the task of Imama. Also, the ultimate evidence can be interpreted as representing the proofs and evidences for the rightfulness of Shi'a Imams (a). In any case, this particular phrase affirms that later Shi'a Imams shall be among the descendants of Imam al-Husayn (a), a fact that has been stated in other mutawatir narrations. [9] The continuity of the Divine Guidance through the continuity of Imama. Rejecting only one Imam means rejecting all of them: As non-selective belief in all the previous Prophets is necessary for Islamic faith and rejecting one of them results in rejecting all of them; likewise rejecting one of Shi'a Imams results in disbelief in all of them. Completion of Imama by Imam al-Mahdi (a) . According to the hadith of Tablet, Allah says: I shall complete it (Imama) by his son (the son of Hasan b. 'Ali al-'askari ), Muhammad. The doctrine of Mahdawiyya in the hadith of Lawh: Mahdawiyya means the general belief in a divinely appointed leader, savior and reformer that will rise in the end of time, who shall eradicate all forms of injustice and oppression and will establish justice in the globe.in the hadith of Lawh, Allah, the exalted one, describes this person as: ( قاصم الجابرين و مديل المظلومین ) \"Qasim al-jabbarin and Mudil al-mazlumin\" the smasher of the oppressors and helper of the oppressed ones. This, in harmony with Qur'anic verses in this regard, refers to the doctrine of Mahdawiyya. Prophecies of the events of each Imam: some parts of the hadith of Lawh contain the prophecies of what will happen to each of the Imams. In Sunni Sources Al-Tabrisi writes in I'lam al-wara that there are implicit and partial references to the hadith of Lawh in Sunni sources; however the entire hadith cannot be found in Sunni hadith collections.

Burial Place Kufa Religious Information Presence at ghazwas 17 ghazwas Zayd b. Arqam al-Anṣārī al-Khazrajī (Arabic: زَید بن أرقَم الأنصاري الخَزرَجي ) was among the Sahaba of the Prophet (s) , special companions of Imam 'Ali (a) and one of the transmitters of the hadith al-Ghadir . After the Battle of 'Ashura' , he seriously objected the behavior of Ibn Ziyad towards the head of Imam al-Husayn (a) . His Lineage and Teknonym His lineage is mentioned as Zayd b. Arqam b. Zayd b. Qays b. Nu'man b. Malik al-Ansari al-Khazraji. About the teknonym of Zayd, there are disagreements in different sources: Abu Sa'd, Abu Insiyya, Abu 'Amr, Abu 'Amir, Abu Sa'ida, Ibn 'Adiyy, Abu 'Imara, Abu Hamza, Abu Anis. The Time of Prophet (s) Zayd participated in 19 battles, in 17 of which he was accompanying the Prophet (s) . The first battle he participated in was Muraysi' . He did not participate in Uhud and Badr due to his young age. Zayd is the one who reported about the 'Abd Allah b. 'Ubayy 's hypocrite word to the Prophet (s) . 'Abd Allah b. 'Ubayy denied his wrong word, insisted on lying of Zayd b. Arqam, swore and elders of the Helpers backed him and said that Zayd was a child and has made a mistake. Then, verses seven and eight of the Quran 63 were revealed to the Prophet (s) and mentioned the wrong words of 'Abd Allah b. 'Ubayy. The Time of the Three Caliphs It is narrated from Fadl b. Shadhan that Zayd b. Arqam was among the first people who returned to Imam 'Ali (a) . In the Event of Saqifa , in support of Imam 'Ali (a), Zayd believed that if he (a) was chosen as the caliph after the Prophet (s), there would be no disagreement. In the Government of Imam 'Ali (a) Zayd accompanied Imam 'Ali (a) in the Battle of Siffin and was among his best companions. Some have said that when Imam 'Ali (a) asked his companions to testify on what they have heard from the Prophet (s) regarding the hadith \"Man kunt-u mawlah fa Ali-yyun mawlah\" (\"one for whom I am the master, 'Ali is his master\"), Zayd did not testify and Imam (a) asked God that Zayd becomes blind and he became so. Sayyid Muhsin al-Amin wrote that since this report has been given about al-Bara' b. 'Azib , it seems that reports about Zayd's hiding testimony have mistaken him with al-Bara', because many narrators have narrated the Hadith of Ghadir from Zayd. Moreover, Zayd was among those who regarded Imam 'Ali (a) superior to others and was among his special companions. Narrating Hadith al-Ghadir Zayd was among narrators of Hadith al-Ghadir from the Prophet (s) and many narrators in authentic Sunni sources (including Ahmad b. Hanbal in his Musnad , al-Nasa'i in al-Sunan al-kubra and Khasa'is Amir al-mu'minin , al-Hakim al-Niyshapuri in Mustadrak ) have narrated this hadith though different references from him. His Reaction after the Battle of 'Ashura' His Objection to Ibn Ziyad Allama Majlisi wrote, \"From Sa'id b. Mu'adh and 'Amr b. Suhayl , it has been narrated that we were in the gathering of Ibn Ziyad and saw that 'Ubayd Allah using a stick was hitting the eyes and lips of Imam al-Husayn (a) and was insulting him; Zayd b. Arqam was also sitting there and said, 'O Ibn Ziyad, put away your stick, because I saw the Prophet (s) putting his lips on these lips and mouth, (and kissed them),' Then, he cried loudly. Here, Ibn Ziyad said, 'O enemy of God! May God make your eyes tearful! If you were not a very old man who has lost his mind, I surly would order to behead you.'\" Reciting the Qur'an on Spear Another report has been narrated from Zayd that, \"when the head of Imam al-Husayn (a) was passed before me in Kufa while it was on spear, I was sitting in a room. When it arrived in front of me I heard him saying, \"Do you suppose that the Companions of the Cave and the Inscription were among Our wonderful signs?\" so, it was stunned and called, 'O son of the Prophet (s)! Swear by God! Your head is more surprising.'\" His Demise The year of his demise is disagreed among different sources. Ibn Sa'd in al-Tabaqat al-kubra , al-Hakim in Mustadrak , Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in al-Isti'ab , and Ibn Athir in Usd al-ghaba have said that he passed away in Kufa in 68 AH/687-8. Some have considered his demise during the rule of Mukhtar in Kufa in 66 AH/685-6 and some others have regarded it in 65 AH/684-5.

{"title": "Hadith al-Wilaya", "text": "Hadith al-Wilaya Subject Proof of Imamate and Wilaya of Imam Ali (a) Issued by Prophet Muhammad (s) Main narrator 'Imran b. Husayn Shi'a sources Kashf al-ghumma Sunni sources  and ... Ḥadīth al-Wilāya (Arabic: حَدیث الوِلایَة ) is a hadith from the Prophet (s) which is cited by the Shi'a as evidence for the imamate of 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) . The hadith has been cited in different wordings in Shiite and Sunni sources. The best-known version of the hadith is: \"he is the wali of every believer after me ( هُوَ وَلِیُّ کُلِّ مُؤْمِنٍ بَعْدی )\". The Shi'a take the word \"wali\" in this hadith to mean the Imam and the leader, and thus, they appeal to the hadith as evidence for the imamate of 'Ali (a). They believe that this is the literal meaning of the word, \"wali\", and the word has been used in this meaning by Shaykhayn , some of the Sahaba , some of the Tabi'un and some Sunni scholars as well. However, Sunni Muslims believe that the word \"wali\" here is used to mean friend and guardian, which has nothing to do with imamate. Text Ja'far b. Sulayman quoted 'Imran b. Husayn that the Prophet Muhammad (s) sent a group of people to an expedition under the commandership of 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a). They gained some booties, and 'Ali (a) distributed the booties among them in a way that they did not like. Four of them decided to report the story to the Prophet (s) and complain about 'Ali's (a) action as soon as they saw him. When they met the Prophet (s), they all told him: \"O the messenger of God! Do you know what 'Ali did?\" The Prophet (s) angrily said: \"what do you want from 'Ali? What do you want from 'Ali? 'Ali is from me and I am from 'Ali, and 'Ali is the wali of every believer after me\". Different Versions The hadith has been cited in Shiite and Sunni sources in different ways. For example, \"'Ali is the wali of every believer after me ( علی ولی کل مؤمن بعدی )\" , \"he is the wali of every believer after me ( هو ولی کل مؤمن بعدی )\" , \"you are the wali of every believer after me ( أنت ولی کل مؤمن بعدی )\" , \"you are the wali of every of every male and female believer after me ( أنت ولی کل مؤمن بعدی و مؤمنة )\", \"you are my wali in every believer after me ( أنت ولیی فی کل مؤمن بعدی )\" , \"so he is your wali after me ( فإنه ولیکم بعدی )\" , \"truly 'Ali is your wali after me ( إن علیاً ولیکم بعدی )\" , \"this is your wali after me ( هذا ولیکم بعدی )\" , \"truly you are the wali of the believers after me ( إنک ولی المؤمنین من بعدی )\" , \"and you are my successor (caliph) in every believer after me ( و أنت خلیفتی فی کل مؤمن من بعدی )\" , and \"so he is the most foremost of all people to you after me ( فهو أولی الناس بکم بعدی )\". Content The Shi'a believe that the hadith concerns the issue of 'Ali's (a) imamate and wilaya . They take the word, \"wali\", to mean a supervisor, an Imam , a leader, and a caliph . However, Sunni Muslims believe that the hadith has no implications regarding the caliphate of 'Ali b. Abi Talib, because they claim that the word \"wali\" literally means a friend and a helper. To establish their claim, the Shi'a say that the word \"wali\" literally means a guardian, a leader, a caliph, an authority, and an Imam, and the word was used in this way in the early years of Islam and after that. They also appeal to the uses of the word \"wali\" by the First Caliph , the Second Caliph , the Sahaba , the Tabi'un , and some Sunni scholars to mean a caliph and a guardian. Reliability According to 'Abd al-Qadir al-Baghdadi and Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, the hadith was cited by al-Tirmidhi with a reliable chain of transmitters leading to 'Imran b. Husayn. Al-Muttaqi al-Hindi said that the hadith is reliable. According to al-Hakim al-Nishaburi, the hadith has a reliable chain of transmitters which was not cited by Muslim and al-Bukhari in Sahihayn . Shams al-Din al-Dhahabi and Nasir al-Din al-Albani have also considered the hadith to be reliable. Sources The hadith was cited in books, such as Sahih al-Tirmidhi Musnad Ahmad b. Hanbal Jami' al-ahadith by al-Suyuti Kanz al-'ummal Musnad Abi Dawud Fada'il al-sahaba Al-Ahad wa l-mathani Sunan al-Nasa'i Musnad Abu Ya'la Sahih Ibn Habban Al-Mu'jam al-kabir by al-Tabarani Tarikh madina Dimashq Al-Bidaya wa l-nihaya Al-Isaba Al-Jawhara fi nasab al-Imam 'Ali wa alih Khazana al-adab wa lubb lubab lisan al-'arab Al-Isti'ab Examinations of the Chains of Transmitters Al-Mubarakfuri claims that the phrase \"after me\", which is missing from some versions of the hadith, was added to it by some Shiite transmitters. To establish his claim, he appeals to Musnad Ibn Hanbal in which the hadith is cited with different chains of transmitters, but in none of which, he claims, the phrase, \"after me\", appears. However, Ahmad b. Hanbal has cited the hadith in his Musnad as well as Fada'il al-sahaba with the phrase, \"after me\". Al-Mubarakfuri also claims that the hadith was only transmitted by Ja'far b. Sulayman and Ibn Ajlah al-Kindi, and since they both were Shi'as, their hadiths cannot be accepted. He takes the Shi'a to be heretics and believes that hadiths transmitted by heretics should be rejected. However, according to al-Albani, the only criterion for the evaluation of hadiths for Sunni scholars is truthfulness and carefulness in the transmission of hadiths, and a transmitter's religious tendency has nothing to do with accepting or rejecting his hadiths. Thus, al-Bukhari and Muslim have transmitted hadiths from people who were opposed to the Sunni denomination, such as Khawarij and the Shi'a. According to al-Albani, the hadith was also transmitted through different chains of transmitters none of whom were Shi'as. Sayyid 'Ali Milani claims that the hadith was transmitted by 12 Sahaba , including Imam 'Ali (a) , Imam al-Hasan (a) , Abu Dhar , Abu Sa'id al-Khidri , and Bara' b. 'Azib most of which were transmitted by 'Imran b. Husayn , Ibn 'Abbas , and Burayda b. Husayb . The hadith was transmitted by Ibn 'Abbas with phrases such as \"you are the wali of every believer after me\", \"you are the wali of every male and female believer after me\", and \"you are my wali in every believer after me\", and with the phrase, \"'Ali is the wali of every believer after me\", from 'Imran b. Husayn. Burayda b. Husayb transmitted the hadith with phrases, \"truly 'Ali is your wali after me\" and \"this is your wali after me\". Moreover, Ja'far b. Sulayman is a transmitter of hadiths in Sahih Muslim . Al-Dhahabi referred to him as an \"imam\" (a leader) and quoted Yahya b. Mu'in as saying that Ja'far was reliable. Al-Albani believed that Ja'far was a reliable transmitter of hadiths who transmitted reliable hadiths and tended towards Ahl al-Bayt (a) without calling other people to his own tendency. He said that the leaders of the religion agreed that if a truthful person was a heretic without calling other people to his views, it would be correct to appeal to his hadiths. According to some Sunni scholars, Ibn Ajlah was reliable as well, taking his hadiths to be hasan . Al-Albani considered Ajlah's hadiths to be evidence for the reliability of Ja'far b. Sulayman's hadiths. According to al-Mubarakfuri, Ibn Taymiyya claimed that the hadith was a lie attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Al-Albani, a Sunni scholar, expressed his surprise at Ibn Taymiyya's denial of the hadith. Monograph Hadith al-wilaya , Sayyid 'Ali Husayni Milani, Markaz al-Haqa'iq al-Islamiyya, 1421/2000-1.

Hanbal Ḥadīth al-thaqalayn (Arabic: حَديث الثَّقَلَين , literally: hadith of the two weighty things) is a famous and mutawatir (massively transmitted) hadith from the Prophet (s) , which enjoins Muslims to follow the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt (a) after the Holy Prophet's (s) demise. Based on this hadith, Muslims should refer to the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt (a) and these two are inseparable. The hadith is accepted by all Muslims, both Sunni and Shi'a , as authentic and has been recorded in the hadith collections of all Muslim sects. Relying on this hadith, Shi'a scholars prove the necessity of the Imam , his infallibility , and the continuation of Imamate in all times. Text Hadith of thaqalayn is narrated a little differently in different sources, but the content is the same. Al-Kafi which is one of the Four Books of Shi'a , إِنِّی تَارِک فِیکمْ أَمْرَینِ إِنْ أَخَذْتُمْ بِهِمَا لَنْ تَضِلُّوا- کتَابَ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ وَ أَهْلَ بَیتِی عِتْرَتِی أَیهَا النَّاسُ اسْمَعُوا وَ قَدْ بَلَّغْتُ إِنَّکمْ سَتَرِدُونَ عَلَی الْحَوْضَ فَأَسْأَلُکمْ عَمَّا فَعَلْتُمْ فِی الثَّقَلَینِ وَ الثَّقَلَانِ کتَابُ اللَّهِ جَلَّ ذِکرُهُ وَ أَهْلُ بَیتِی \"Indeed I am leaving two things among you, to which if you hold yourself, you will never astray: the book of Allah –who is all mighty and great- and my ahl al-bayt (household), my 'itra (family). O people hear! And I have announced to you that: indeed you will enter my presence and I will ask you about what you did to the thaqalayn (two weighty things) and the thaqalayn are the book of Allah and my ahl al-bayt.\" Sunan al-Nasa'i , one of the six sahih (authentic) books of Sunnis: کأنی قد دعیت فاجبت، انی قد ترکت فیکم الثقلین احدهما اکبر من الآخر، کتاب الله و عترتی اهل بیتی، فانظروا کیف تخلفونی فیهما، فانهما لن یفترقا حتی یردا علی الحوض \"Looks like I have been called, and I answered (my time of death has come), indeed I have left the thaqalayn (two weighty things) among you, one of them is greater form the other, the book of Allah and my 'itra (family), my ahl al-bayt (household). So look after how you will behave with them after me, indeed they will never separate from each other until they enter my presence by the pool [in the paradise].\" Sources The hadith is accepted by both Shi'a and Sunni scholars and has been mentioned in their sources. Sunni Sources According to the book Hadith al-thaqalayn wa maqamat ahl al-bayt , the hadith has been narrated by 25 companions of the Prophet (s) in Sunni sources, some of which are: Zayd b. Arqam : the hadith of thaqalayn is narrated with 6 chains of narration from him in the books: Sunan an-Nasa'i , [4] al-Mu'jam al-kabir , [5] Sunan al-Tirmidhi , [6] Mustadrak al-Hakim , [7] Musnad Ahmad . [8] Zayd b. Thabit : in Musnad Ahmad [9] and al-Mu'jam al-kabir . [10] Jabir b. 'Abd Allah : in Sunan al-Tirmidhi , [11] al-Mu'jam al-kabir , [12] and al-Mu'jam al-awsat . [13] Hudhayfa b. Usayd : in al-Mu'jam al-kabir [14] Abu Sa'id al-Khudri : in Musnad Ahmad [15] and Du'afa' al-kabir . [16] Imam 'Ali (a) : with 2 chains of narrators in al-Bahr al-zikhar [17] and Kanz al-'Ummal . [18] Abu Dhar al-Ghifari : in al-Mu'talaf wa al-Mukhtalaf . [19] Abu Hurayra : in Kashf al-astar 'an zawa'id al-bazar [20] 'Abd Allah b. Hantab: in Usd al-ghaba [21] Jubayr b. Mut'im : in Zilal al-Janna [22] Al-Bahrani , the author of Ghayat al-maram wa hujjat al-khisam , narrated the hadith from 39 chains of narrations from Sunni authors. According to the book, the hadith is narrated in Musnad Ahmad , Sahih Muslim , Manaqib Ibn al-Maghazili , Sunan al-Tirmidhi , al-'Umda Tha'labi , Musnad Abi Ya'li , al-Mu'jam al-awsat , al-'Umda Ibn al-Bitriq , Yanabi' al-mawadda , al-Tara'if , Fara'id al-simatayn , and the commentary on Nahj al-balagha by Ibn Abi al-Hadid . Shi'a Sources According to Ghayat al-maram wa hujjat al-khisam , in Shi'a sources 82 hadiths are narrated with the content of the hadith of thaqalayn, in many books such as: Usul al-kafi , Kamal al-din , al-Amali ( al-Saduq ), al-Amali ( al-Mufid ), al-Amali ( al-Tusi ), 'Uyun akhbar al-Rida (a) , al-Ghayba ( al-Nu'mani ), Basa'ir al-darajat . Monographs In addition to the narration of the hadith of thaqalayn, Shi'a scholars have also written independent books about it, like: Hadith al-thaqalayn by Qawam al-Din Muhammad Wishnawi Qummi, Sa'adat al-darayn fi sharh hadith al-thaqalayn by 'Abd al-'Aziz Dihlawi in Farsi, Hadith al-thaqalayn by Najm al-Din al-'Askari, Hadith al-Thaqalayn by Sayyid 'Ali al-Milani , Hadith al-thaqalayn wa maqamat ahl al-bayt by Ahmad al-Mahuzi. Place and Time There's disagreement about when and where the hadith is stated; for example Ibn Hajar al-Haytami says: \" the Prophet (s) , stated the hadith of thaqalayn, after the conquest of Mecca , on his way back to Medina , in Ta'if \"; but others mentioned other times and places. Studying these different hadiths, it's apparent that although some of them could be considered as different reports about a single occurrence, but not for many others; so it is clear that the Prophet (a) has mentioned the importance of thaqalayn ( Qur'an and ahl al-bayt (a) ) in different times and places, especially in his last days of life. The following are some of the places and times mentioned in historical reports: In Hajjat al-wida' , [27] while riding on a camel, in the 'Arafa day. [28] Near the Ghadir Khumm , [29] and the hadith of Ghadir is stated after it. [30] In a sermon in a Friday, along with the hadith of Ghadir. [31] In a congregational prayer in Khayf mosque , in the last day of the tashriq days . [32] Over a pulpit [33] In his last sermon. [34] In a sermon after his last congregational prayer. [35] In bed, when he was ill and some of the companions were around him. [36] Sunna or 'Itra? In some of the sources of Sunnis , instead of the word \" 'itra \" (family) the word \"sunna\" (tradition) has been mentioned. These narrations are rare and even Sunni scholars have not considered them; because the hadith with the word \"sunna\" has not appeared in earlier reliable sources. Who are 'Itra? In most of the narrations the phrase \" ahl al-bayt \" has come as a description for the word \"'itra\", but in some narrations only \"'itra\", and in some other only \"ahl al-bayt\" has come, and in some cases the order about the obedience of ahl al-bayt is repeated. In some of Shi'a sources, twelve Imams (a) are mentioned as the explanation of \"ahl al-bayt\". Importance Shi'a scholars have narrated the hadith of thaqalayn in their books and have referred to it as a proof for some of the Shi'a beliefs. Mir Hamid Husayn (d. 1306/1888) has dedicated a comprehensive chapter of his book 'Abaqat al-anwar to the hadith of thaqalayn and its chains of narrators based on Sunni sources. In the discussion of Imamate , he had mentioned this hadith prior to other related hadiths. Some of the beliefs of Shi'a could be proved using hadith of thaqalayn: Necessity of the Obedience of Ahl al-Bayt (a) In the hadith of thaqalayn, ahl al-bayt (a) are put next to Qur'an , and this is stated that they will not separate from each other; therefore, as the obedience of the Qur'an is necessary for Muslims, so is the obedience of ahl al-bayt (a). Infallibility of Ahl al-Bayt (a) There are two points in hadith of thaqalayn about the infallibility of ahl al-bayt (a): Putting stress on that if you obey the Qur'an and ahl al-bayt (a), you will never astray. This clearly shows that there's no error in the teachings of ahl al-bayt (a). The companionship of ahl al-bayt (a) with Qur'an shows that as Qur'an is free from any error –according to the consensus ( ijma' ) of Muslims- so the other side (ahl al-bayt (a)) must also be free from errors. In addition to Shi'a scholars some Sunni scholars have also accepted the indication of the hadith to the infallibility of ahl al-bayt (a). Necessity of the Continuation of Imamate The companionship of ahl al-bayt (a) with Qur'an shows that as Qur'an is the source of guidance in Islam , so there must always be someone from ahl al-bayt (a) to whom people refer in religious issues. The Prophet (a) emphasizes that the Qur'an and ahl al-bayt (a) will never separate from each other. The Prophet (a) says if you hold yourself to these two, you will never astray. In his commentary on al-Mawahib , al-Zurqani al-Maliki, one of the Sunni scholars, narrates from al-'Allama al-Samhudi : \"It is realized from the hadith of thaqalayn that there is always a person from ahl al-bayt (a) who deserves to be followed, till the Day of Judgment ; so he is meant by the persuasion in the hadith, as the book (Qur'an) is like this [which is and will be always available].\" Scientific Authority of Ahl al-Bayt (a) Since the Qur'an is the main source of beliefs and practical rulings of all Muslims and according to hadith of thaqalayn ahl al-bayt (a) are the inseparable company of the Qur'an, it is clear that ahl al-bayt (a) are the infallible scientific authority in all of Islamic sciences. Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din in his discussion with Shaykh Sulaym al-Bushri –the discussion is quoted in al-Muraji'at - proved the scientific authority of ahl al-bayt (a) and the necessity of their obedience. Hadith al-Thaqalayn and Proximity of Islamic Sects As mentioned above, the hadith of thaqalayn is accepted by both Shi'a and Sunni scholars. There have been many discussions about the hadith which have resulted in the convergence of Islamic sects; including the discussion of Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din with al-Shyakh Sulaym al-Bushri, one of the Sunni scholars; the discussion formed the book al-Muraji'at .

{"title": "Hadith Man Mat", "text": "Hadith Man Mat Subject Knowing the Imam Issued by Prophet Muhammad (s) Validity of the chain of transmission It has been claimed that it is Mutawatir Shi'a sources Al-Kafi • Kamal al-din wa tamam al-ni'ma • Sunni sources Sahih Muslim • Musnad Ahmad b. Hanbal  Ḥadīth Man Māt (Arabic: حَدیث مَنْ مات ) is a well-known hadith from the Prophet Muhammad (s) according to which: \"if a man dies while he does not know the Imam of his time, he will die a death of Jahiliyya (Ignorance Era)\". The hadith is cited in Shi'a and Sunni sources with different wordings. The Shi'as take it to be concerned with the problem of imamate , implying the obligation of knowing and obeying the Imams . Sunni scholars take it to be concerned with the relationship between people and a Muslim ruler and the obligation of pledging their allegiance to him. Text النبي الاعظم ص مَنْ ماتَ وَ لَمْ يَعْرِفْ إمامَ زَمانِهِ مَاتَ مِيتَةً جَاهِلِيَّة If a man dies while he does not know the Imam of his time, he will die a death of ignorance Ibn Shahrashub , al-Manaqib , vol.1 p.246 There are some hadiths in Islamic sources beginning with the phrase, \"man mat\" (if a man dies). By \"Hadith Man Mat\" is meant the Prophet's (s) well-known remark according to which everyone must know imam of his time and if he does not know him he will die a death of ignorance. Ibn Abi Ya'fur asked Imam al-Sadiq (a) about the Prophet's hadith according to which, \"if a man dies while he does not know the Imam of his time, he will die a death of ignorance\": is it the death as an unbeliever? He replied: \"it is the death as a misguided person\". He then asked: \"if a man dies at this time without a leader, will he die a death of ignorance?\" He replied: \"Yes\". Hadith Man Mat is cited with slight differences in Sunni sources as well. The Prophet (s) said: \"if a man dies without an Imam, he will die a death of ignorance\" ; or \"if a man withdraws from obedience, he will meet God on Dooms Day without a plea, and if a man dies without having pledged an allegiance, he will die a death of ignorance\" . Sunni scholars take this hadith to be reliable and good . Some Shi'a scholars considered this hadith to be mutawatir in Shi'a and Sunni sources. In Theological Issues The Shi'as have appealed to the hadith in their discussions of the problem of imamate to argue that it is an obligation to known and obey the Imams. According to the Shi'a, the \"imam\" in this hadith refers to Ahl al-Bayt (a) and Infallible Imams (a) , and at present, it refers to Imam al-Mahdi (a) . However, Sunni scholars have provided a different interpretation of this hadith. In his Sahih , Muslim b. Hajjaj cited this hadith under a section entitled as \"the section concerning the obligation of accompanying the group [i.e. majority of Muslims] at the time of riots and avoiding people who call to infidelity\". Some Sunni sources have interpreted the hadith in terms of another hadith from the Prophet (s) according to which, \"if a man dies while parting with the group [i.e. majority of Muslims], he will die a death of ignorance\". Sunni Muslims take the \"imam\" in this hadith to refer to the ruler of the Islamic community who should be obeyed and to whom people should pledge their allegiance in order to keep the majority. The obligation of obeying the Islamic ruler include all Muslim rulers, regardless of whether they are just, sinners, or whatever. In his interpretation of this hadith, Ibn Taymiyya held that the Sahaba and Tabi'un were obliged to obey and pledge their allegiance to Yazid b. Mu'awiya . Some Sunni sources have taken the \"imam\" in this hadith to refer to the Prophet (s) himself, holding that people are obliged to believe in him, because he is the leader of people in this world.

Abi Talib (a) as his immediate successor. According to sources of history, hadiths and Qur'anic exegesis, the story has occurred in the third year of his Bi'tha when he was required by verse 214 of Qur'an 26 , known as the al-Indhar Verse , to call his close kinsmen to Islam. The hadith is one of the of evidence appealed to by Imamiyya scholars of theology to show the immediate succession of the Prophet (s) by Imam Ali (a) . Timeline of in Mecca 'Abd Allah Amina bt.

It is also used in Arabic to refer to an event, such as Yawm al-Jamal which means the event or Battle of Jamal . And \"al-dār\" (Arabic: الدار ) means \"the house\"; and it refers to the Prophet (s)'s house. Thus the phrase means the event of the Prophet (s)'s house. It has also been referred to as Bad' al-Da'wa (Arabic: بدء الدعوة ) which means the beginning of the invitation, and \"Yawm al-Indhar\" (Arabic: یوم الإنذار ) which means the event of warning. In some sources of history and hadiths, the event of 'Uthman b. Affan 's murder has also been referred to as \"Yawm al-Dar\". Story According to sources of Islamic history and Qur'anic exegesis, when the al-Indhar Verse was revealed to the Prophet (s) three years after Bi'tha /611, the Prophet (s) ordered Ali b. Abi Talib (a) to provide some meal and invite the sons of 'Abd al-Muttalib to a banquet so that he calls them to Islam . Around forty people, including Abu Talib , Hamza , and Abu Lahab went to the meeting. It has been said that there was not much food, but everyone felt full while nothing was consumed of the food. Abu Lahab said: \" Muhammad has performed magic!\" These words dissuaded the Prophet (s) from expressing his call, and the meeting finished without any result. By the Prophet (s)'s order, Ali (a) was once again commissioned to prepare a banquet. In the second or third attempt, after having the food, the Prophet (s) said: O' sons of 'Abd al-Muttalib! I swear to God that I do not know any youth among Arabs who brought for his tribe something better than what I brought to you; I have brought to you the best in this world and in the afterlife, and God has ordered me to call you to it. So which of you assists me in this mission so that I make him my brother and my successor and my caliph among you? Nobody responded to him. But Ali (a) who was the youngest of all said: \"O' the prophet! I will assist you\". The Prophet (s) said: “ This is my brother and my successor among you. Listen to him and obey him\". ” Everyone got up and told Abu Talib with a smirk: \"Muhammad has ordered you to obey your son and listen to him\". Historians and interpreters of the Qur'an have mentioned this event under different titles. Accounts According to 'Allama Amini , in addition to the above account of the event, there are six other accounts of the Prophet (s)'s words in the story: \"Who will pledge me his in order to be my brother and companion and your guardian (waliyyukum)?\" In this account, the word \"my caliph (successor)\" does not appear, but the word \"waliyyukum\" (your guardian) appears which does not figure in the previous account. This account supports the first. \"Which of you likes to be my brother and my minister and my successor and my caliph in my people (umma) and the guardian of all believers? … O' ! Fill his heart with knowledge and understanding and wisdom. He then told : O' Abu Talib! Listen to your son and obey him, since God has given him a position to His Prophet like that of to \". This account does not only support the second account but also refers to , emphasizing the immediate succession of Imam Ali (a). \"Who will be my brother and my minister and my friend and my successor and my caliph in my household and will pay my debts?\" This reinforces the previous account. \"God has never chosen a prophet unless He also has chosen for him a brother and a minister and an heir and a successor and a caliph from his household. Now which of you stands and pledges me his allegiance in order to be my brother and my heir and my minister and my successor and be to me like Aron to Moses, except that there is no prophet after me?\" This account reinforces the first account, in addition to involving the content of Hadith al-Manzila. \"So which of you pledges me his allegiance in order to be my brother and my companion and my heir?\" This account does not involve the phrase \"my caliph \", but it has \"my heir\" instead. \"I call you to two words which are light on the tongue, but are heavy on the scale: testifying that there is no god except and that I am the messenger of God, so whoever accepts my call to this mission and assists me in this and takes care of the job will be my brother and my successor and my minister and my heir and my caliph after me\". This account is also explicit that Ali (a) is the Prophet (s)'s immediate caliph . Importance This hadith is one of the most important hadiths in favor of Imam Ali (a) 's immediate succession of the Prophet (s); it was appealed to by many Shiite scholars of theology . Imam Ali (a) himself has appealed to this hadith against his opponents. 'Allama Amini has discussed the hadith and its different ways of narration in full detail. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid has appealed to the Yawm al-dar hadith in his interpretation of the word \" mawla \" in Hadith al-Ghadir and the proof of Imam Ali (a)'s caliphate and wilaya . Like other Shiite scholars of theology, he believes that Imam Ali (a)'s wilaya and caliphate have not been mentioned only in Ghadir , but have also been mentioned on other occasions, one of which is Yawm al-Dar. According to him, many Shiite and Sunni scholars of hadith have cited this hadith so frequently that it counts as a mustafid hadith.

{"title": "Hadith of Twelve Caliphs", "text": "Hadith of Twelve Caliphs Subject Imamate of the twelve Imams (a) Issued by Prophet Muhammad (s) Main narrator Abd Allah b. Mas'ud • Jabir b. Samura • Anas b. Malik Shi'a sources Man la yahduruh al-faqih Sunni sources Sahih Muslim • Sahih al-Bukhari Hadīth of Twelve Caliphs (Arabic: حدیث إثنی عشر خلیفة ) is a hadith by Prophet Muhammad (s) according to which his caliphs or successors are only twelve people, all of whom are from Quraysh . The hadith was quoted with different wordings, and is taken as reliable by Sunni scholars of hadiths. The Shi'as appeal to this hadith as evidence for the imamate of their twelve Imams (a) . Sunni scholars have no consensus over the instances of the twelve caliphs referred to by this hadith. Text The hadith known as that of the Twelve Caliphs has been narrated by different narrators of hadiths with different wordings, although they all have one and the same content. The content of the hadith is that after the Prophet Muhammad (s), twelve people will be his successors. In different versions of this hadith, words such as \"khalifa\" (caliph), \"amir\" (ruler), \"naqib\" (head), and \"imam\" are used. Hadith of Twelve Caliphs is cited in Sahih al-Bukhari from Jabir b. Samura from the Prophet (s) as Twelve Amirs (i.e. rulers), Jabir said, “ .جَابِر بْنَ سَمُرَةَ قَالَ سَمِعْتُ النَّبِی(ص)، یقُولُ: یکونُ اِثْنی عَشَرَ اَمیراً فَقالَ کلِمَهً لَمْ اَسْمَعْها، فَقالَ اَبی اِنَّهُ قالَ کلُّهُم مِنْ قُرَیشٍ I heard the Prophet (s) say: 'there will be Twelve Amirs (rulers)', and then he said a word that I did not hear, but my father said that the Prophet (s) had said: 'they are all from Quraysh. ” This hadith is also cited in Sahih Muslim with a slight variation as Twelve Caliphs. According to this book, the Prophet (s) said: \"'Islam will always be respected as long as the Twelve Caliphs rule the Muslims'. He then said something that I did not hear, so I asked my father what the Prophet (s) said, He said that the Prophet (s) said, \"They are all from Quraysh\". This hadith is also cited in Sunan Abi Dawud and Sunan al-Tirmidhi . A hadith is also cited in sources of hadiths from 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud according to which the caliphs or Imams after the Prophet (s) are 12 people: the same number as that of Israelite heads or naqibs. Sources of the Hadith Ayatollah Safi Gulpayigani has devoted the first part of his book, Muntakhab al-athar , to the Hadith of Twelve Caliphs. He has collected 148 citations of the hadith in the early hadith collections. According to him, 17 companions of the Prophet (s) quoted the hadith from the Prophet (s) with different, though close, phrases. Ayatollah Safi has cited 52 chains of narrations of the hadith narrated by Jabir b. Samura. Some of these chains are repetitive in their first three or four narrators. Four people have narrated the hadith directly from 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud. In addition to Shiite sources, the hadith was frequently cited in Sunni sources as well as the Hadith of Twelve Naqibs or Twelve Imams. The author of Muntakhab al-athar collected and cited the hadith of Jabir b. Samura from some Sunni sources. He also cited the hadith narrated by 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud from the Prophet (s) from Musnad Ahmad . In addition to Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim , the following Sunni sources cited the hadith as well: Al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan Sunan Abi Dawud Musnad Ahmad b. Hanbal Al-Suyuti in his Tarikh al-khulafa (A history of Caliphs). Instances of the Twelve Caliphs There is no doubt among Shi'as that the instances of the Tweleve Caliphs are the tweleve Imams. Some Sunni scholars attempted to determine the instances of these twelve caliphs. 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar is quoted as saying that the Twelve Imams are Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa , 'Umar b. al-Khattab , 'Uthman b. 'Affan , Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan , Yazid b. Mu'awiya , al-Saffah , al-Mansur al-'Abbasi , Jabir, Amin, Salam, Mahdi, and Amir al-'Asab. Al-Suyuti holds that the Twelve Imams are: Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman, 'Ali (a) , al-Hasan (a) , Mu'awiya, 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr , and 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz . He then speculated that two other caliphs probably are al-Muhtadi al-'Abbasi and al-Zahir, both of whom were Abbasid Caliphs, since they were, according to al-Suyuti, righteous people. He then adds that the two other caliphs remain that we should wait for: one of them is al-Mahdi who is one of the Prophet's (s) Ahl al-Bayt (a) , and the other he does not mention. Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani agrees with Qadi 'Ayad that the twelve caliphs are: Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman, 'Ali (a), Mu'awiya, Yazid, 'Abd al-Malik b. Marwan , Walid b. 'Abd al-Malik , Sulayman b. 'Abd al-Malik , Yazid b. 'Abd al-Malik , Hisham b. 'Abd al-Malik , and Walid b. Yazid b. 'Abd al-Malik . Al-Qunduzi al-Hanafi cited the hadith and then said that a close look into hadiths according to which the caliphs after the Prophet (s) are twelve reveals that by those twelve caliphs he meant the Twelve Imams from his own Ahl a-Bayt (a). He holds that the hadith does not refer to the Rashidun Caliphs since their number is smaller than twelve. It does not refer to Umayyad or Abbasid kings either, since their number is greater than twelve. Moreover, some of them were vicious and unjust people, and were not committed to Islamic rulings, except 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz . What is more, Banu Umayya were not from Banu Hashim , but the Prophet (s), according to 'Abd al-Malik's narration from Jabir, said that they are all from Banu Hashim. So the hadith can only refer to the Twelve Imams from the Prophet's (s) Ahl al-Bayt (a), since they were the most knowledgeable as well as the most pious people of their time, and were superior to others with respect to their acts and genealogy. Most important of all, they had inherited their knowledge from their ancestor, the Prophet Muhammad (s). Al-Qunduzi also appeals to hadiths, such as Hadith al-Thiqlayn , to support his view.

Text and Translation ... قُلْ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ... ... Say, \"I do not ask you any reward for it except love of [my] relatives\"... Quran 42:23 Meaning of Keywords \"Mawadda\" means \"to love\" and \"Qurba\" means blood relatives . Occasion of Revelation All Shi'a and most of Sunni exegetes have narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that after the Prophet's (s) migration to Medina , Helpers had discussions about the Islamic government. They decided to go the Prophet (s) and say, \"We will submit to you all our small wealth and facilities if you have any financial needs for the progress of Islam and the management of the newly-established Islamic society. In any way you take and use it would be our honor.\" That was when al-Mawadda verse was revealed to the Prophet (s) to mention the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) as the reward for the Prophet's (s) mission, not any material or worldly reward . Relatives There are different exegetical views about who or what \"Qurbā\" refers to: Some exegetes, or allegedly most of them, hold that the verse is addressed to the Quraysh . Since the Prophet (s) fought the gods (idols) of the Quraysh, God ordered the Prophet (s) to ask them at least not to be hostile to him because they are his relatives. [4] Thus, \"qurbā\" is a gerund which means being a relative, rather than relatives themselves, [5] and the phrase, \"al-mawadda fi l-qurbā\", means kindness (to the Prophet) because of being relatives. According to other exegetes, the verse is addressed to Helpers . They gave some money to the Prophet (s) as a reward, but he refused the offer. Thus, the verse tells them that the Prophet (s) did not want any money from them; his only reward being their kindness to his relatives among them (through his mother, Amina ). [6] Others maintain that the verse is addressed to the Quraysh or all people, and \"relatives\" in the verse refers to their own relatives. Thus, the verse means that the Prophet (s) did not want any rewards except their kindness to their own relatives ( Silat al-Rahim ). [7] Others suggest that \"qurbā\" refers to closeness to God , and \"al-mawadda fi l-qurbā\" consists in loving God through closeness to Him (by obedience). Thus, the verse means that the Prophet (s) did not want any rewards except loving God by being close to Him. [8] Shiite scholars have responded to, and rejected, these four suggestions. (See sources below for more details.) Others hold that \"al-mawadda fi l-qurbā\" means love of the Prophet's (s) relatives, that is, his Ahl al-Bayt (a) . There are many hadiths in Sunni as well as Shiite sources in which the verse is interpreted in this way. Such mutawatir hadiths in both sources support this view. [9] Based on several reasons, Shi'a scholars believe that the intended meaning of \"relatives\" in this verse is \"the Ahl al-Bayt (a) \" i.e. 'Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) and the nine Imams (a) of al-Husayn's (a) progeny. Also, al-'Allama al-Hilli considers al-Mawadda verse, the fourth verse proving the Imamate of 'Ali (a) and quotes from Ibn 'Abbas that when al-Mawadda verse was revealed, the Prophet (s) was asked, \"O the Messenger of God (s)! Who are the relatives, whose love is incumbent upon us?\" and the Prophet (s) answered, \"'Ali (a), Fatima (a), al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a)\". Ibn Hanbal (the Sunni founder of Hanbali School ) has narrated this hadith from Ibn 'Abbas, too. Related Hadiths Imam al-Sajjad (a) was asked about the meaning of al-Mawadda verse and Imam (a) answered, \"the intended meaning of the verse is loving us, the Ahl al-Bayt (a) .\" It is narrated from Imam al-Baqir (a) that the intended reference of al-Mawadda verse is the Infallible Imams (a).\" Imam al-Sadiq (a) says, \"al-Mawadda verse is revealed about us, the Ahl al-Bayt (a), Ashab al-Kisa' .\" Hakim al-Hasakani, one of the Sunni scholars has mentioned seven traditions in the commentary of the verse, suggesting that \"al-Qurba\" referred to 'Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) , and al-Husayn (a) . Also Ahmad b. Hanbal narrated that, when \"al-Mawadda verse\" was revealed, companions of the Prophet (s) asked him, \"O the Messenger of God (s)! Who are your relatives, whose love is incumbent upon us?\" and the Prophet (s) answered, \"'Ali (a), Fatima (a) and their two sons\" and he (s) repeated this three times. In his commentary on Ihqaq al-haq , Mar'ashi Najafi has enumerated up to fifty great Sunni scholars who have included hadiths about al-Mawadda verse in their books through numerous chains of transmission . Also al-Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani has mentioned seventeen hadiths from Sunnis and twenty two hadiths from Shiites about this verse in his book Ghayat al-maram wa hujjat al-khisam . Reason for the Obligation of Loving Ahl al-Bayt A careful consideration of hadiths from the Prophet (s) in Shiite and Sunni sources to the effect that people should consult Ahl al-Bayt (a) in order to understand the Qur'an as well as the principles and ancillaries of Islam, such as Hadith al-Thaqalayn and Hadith al-Safina , leaves no doubt that love of Ahl al-Bayt (a) is obligatory as a reward for the Prophet (s) in order to make people consult them to understand the religion. Thus, the love of Ahl al-Bayt (a) is in continuity with prophethood , and thus, the verse is not contradictory to other verses according to which there is no reward for prophethood. Thus, although love of Ahl al-Bayt (a) is taken to be a reward, it is indeed in the interest of people, rather than Ahl al-Bayt (a).

{"title": "Al-Mubahala Verse", "text": "Al-Mubahala Verse Verse's Information Name Al-Mubahala Verse Sura Qur'an 3 Verse 61 Juz' 3 Content Information Cause of Revelation Prophet's debate with Christians of Najran Place of Revelation Medina Others Virtue of Ashab al-Kisa' Related Verses al-Tathir verse Al-Mubāhala verse (Arabic: آية المباهلة ) is verse 61 of Chapter 3 of the Holy Qur'an (Sura Al 'Imran) which is about the Prophet's (s) encounter with Christians of Najran . Shi'ite and some Sunni exegetes have considered this verse as a merit for Ashab al-Kisa' especially Imam 'Ali (a) . Imam Ali (a) has been introduced as the soul of the Prophet (s). Imam al-Rida (a) has considered this verse as the greatest merit for Imam Ali (a) in the Qur'an . Text and Translation “ ” — Qur'an, 3:61 Occasion of Revelation Shi'a and Sunni exegetes believe that this verse is about the debate between the Prophet (s) and the Christians of Najran in which they insisted on their belief that Jesus (a) is one of the three personifications of God and that they did not accept the revelation of the Qur'an which referred to Jesus (a) as merely a pious servant and a messenger of God (s) . Once they rejected the arguments proposed by the Holy Prophet (s), he invited them to attend a Mubahala (a mutual curse). Sunni exegetes such as al-Zamakhshari , Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , al-Baydawi , etc. have said that \"Abna'ana\" (our sons) in the verse refers to al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) , \"Nisa'ana\" (our women) refers to Fatima al-Zahra (a) and \"Anfusana\" (our souls) refers to Imam 'Ali (a) , i.e. the four people who accompanied the Prophet (s) form the five Ashab al-Kisa' . Having seen the sincerity and valor of the Prophet (s) and those who accompanied him, the Christians of Najran became fearful of divine punishment and did not accept Mubahala. They made peace with the Prophet (s) and asked him to let them remain Christian and pay Jizya and the Prophet (s) accepted. Commentary Although the Mubahala was primarily between the Prophet (s) and Christian men, but then children and women were also brought to Mubahala to prove the claim of the caller, thus, the Prophet (s) brought his most beloved ones to Mubahala. In addition, 'Allama Tabataba'i has mentioned another aspect for the involvement of the Prophet's (s) family is that: It is as if the Prophet (s) intends the parties to curse each other and to wish for the divine punishment for the other party so that the curse would include women, children and souls too, so that the enemies would be eradicated. Based on this view, it was not necessary for the parties to be more than two people so that the plural pronouns could be used in the verse, because according to the above opinion, the plural pronoun meant that through mutual cursing the wrong party would be uprooted completely. Exegetes, narrators and historical reports unanimously maintain that the Prophet (s) took no one else to Mubahala except for 'Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) , so the souls were two [the Prophet (s) and 'Ali (a)], the \"women\" was one [Fatima (a)], and the sons were two [al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a)] through which the divine order was fulfilled. Also, other verses are found in the Qur'an which refer to one person while the verbal reference is plural, such as the Zihar verse in Qur'an 58 . In the comments for this verse in his al-Kashshaf , al-Zamakhshari says that: \"Bringing children and women to Mubahala showed more confidence than going alone; because the Prophet (s) brought his most beloved ones to the war to inflict the curse upon each of the parties and God mentions them [sons and women] prior to the selves to show their importance over one's own self.\" Then al-Zamakhshari says, \"This is a proof for the eminence of Ashab al-Kisa' and there is no stronger reason than that.\" Relation to al-Bara'a Verse When the Bara'a verses addressing the polytheists of Mecca were revealed , Prophet (s) initially appointed Abu Bakr to proclaim these verses to the polytheists of Mecca. However, Jabra'il (Gabriel) brought a message from God to the Prophet (s) that: these verses should be proclaimed either by you or someone who belongs to you. Therefore, the Prophet (s) appointed Imam 'Ali (a) who was introduced as the soul of the Prophet (s) in al-Mubahala Verse to proclaim these verses. Greatest Merit of Imam 'Ali (a) in the Qur'an Al-Ma'mun asked Imam al-Rida (a) about the greatest merit of Imam 'Ali (a) in the Qur'an. Imam (a) said: His merit in the event of Mubahala; the Prophet (s) called al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) who were his sons, he (s) called Fatima (a) who was the instance for women in this verse and called 'Ali (a) who is, according to divine decree, the soul of the Prophet (s). There is no creature superior to the Prophet (s); therefore, based on divine decree, there must be no creature superior to the soul of the Prophet (s).

{"title": "Al-Tabligh Verse", "text": "Al-Tabligh Verse Verse's Information Name Al-Tabligh Verse Sura Qur'an 5 Verse 67 Juz' 6 Content Information Cause of Revelation Succession of the Prophet (s) by 'Ali (a) Place of Revelation Mecca About Event of Ghadir Related Verses al-Ikmal verse , al-Wilaya verse The Qur'an 5:67 known as al-Tablīgh verse (Arabic: آیة التَّبليغ , propagation verse) is one of the last verses revealed to the Prophet (s) . According to this verse, the Prophet (s) was obliged to proclaim an important message to people. The verse explicitly denotes the importance of the message that if the Prophet (s) had not proclaimed it, he would not have performed his mission. According to Shi'a and some Sunnis , it is revealed in farewell Hajj just before the Dhu l-Hijja 18 , 10 / March 16 , 632 CE . Shi'a believe that the subject of the message was succession of the Prophet (s) by 'Ali (a) , so after the revelation of this verse, the Prophet (s) announced 'Ali (a) as his vicegerent and successor in Ghadir Khumm . Text and Translation “ يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّـهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ إِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَافِرِينَ O, Messenger! Proclaim that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not you will not have proclaimed His message and Allah shall protect you from people, indeed Allah do not guide the faithless lot. ” — Quran 5:67 Occasion of Revelation Shi'a exegetes and narrators believe that the al-Tabligh verse was revealed in farewell Hajj in Ghadir Khumm regarding the announcement of Imam 'Ali's (a) succession of the Prophet (s). Some Sunni exegetes have agreed with that as well. According to Shi'a sources, after that the Prophet (s) postponed the announcement of Imam 'Ali's succession because he was afraid of hypocrites 's conspiracy, Jabra'il (Gabriel) delivered this verse to him in which God has emphasized on proclaiming of 'Ali's guardianship and protecting the Prophet (s) from hypocrites. Based on this, \"Proclaim that which has been sent down to you from your Lord\" means the guardianship and succession of 'Ali (a) which was revealed to the Prophet (s) earlier but he was worried about its announcement as people might have said he had chosen his cousin for his succession. Other Possibilities Other possible causes have been put forth for the revelation of this verse, however, these causes have been criticized by Muslim and Shi'a scholars. Revelation in Mecca Based on some hadiths , it is said that the al-Tabligh verse was sent down in Mecca obliging the Prophet (s) to propagate the truths of the religion among unbelievers and polytheists . According to these hadiths, some guards were appointed to protect him against his enemies, but after the revelation of this verse he discharged them and said that God will protect him from his enemies. Moreover, he was obliged to inform unbelievers and polytheists about the truths of the religion without any fear. Criticism Exegetes unanimously believe that Qur'an 5 was revealed in Medina and according to some hadiths narrated from 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar , it was the last sura to have revealed. Therefore it is wrong to assume that the al-Tabligh verse was sent down in Mecca and that, for many years, it was recited alone without being joined to any sura. Moreover, some scholars counted the hadiths about the guards protecting the Prophet (s) in Mecca as gharib (strange) and munkar (denied). Proclamation among Ahl al-Kitab As stated by some, al-Tabligh Verse was revealed in Medina with the purpose of obliging the Prophet (s) to convey the revealed truths to people of the book (Jews and Christians) with no fear. According to Abu Hayyan, the message that the Prophet (s) was supposed to convey was the ruling of Rajm (stoning) and Qisas (retaliation in kind), which was sent down in Torah and Gospel but were distorted and changed by Jews and Christians. He argues that verses before and after this verse are also about Ahl al-Kitab and that the topic of this verse should not differ from the subject of those verses. Criticism According to historical sources, following the battles between Muslims and Jews including the Battle of Khaybar and Banu Qurayza , Jews lost their power and grandeur and by the occupation of their castles and expulsion of many of them, their influence waned. Christians also did not have power in Hijaz and especially in Medina . The only instance in which these Christians confronted Muslims was the event of Mubahala , which was canceled at the former's request. Considering the fact that Muslims were very powerful in the final years of the Prophet's (s) life, there was no reason for the Prophet (s) to worry about propagating the truths of religion among Jews and Christians. Moreover, the al-Tabligh Verse is not alien to preceding and following verses. The context of the verses is about rebuking Jews and Christians and probably they thought that by the demise of the Prophet (s), Muslims will lose their power and domination and that they can return to power. But the al-Tabligh verse, which is about appointment of a leader for the Muslim Umma succeeding the Prophet (s), negated their assumptions. This interpretation is consistent with the al-Ikmal verse , which was revealed after the announcement of Imam 'Ali's (a) guardianship. Important Points Importance of this Mission This verse explicitly denotes the importance and sensitivity of the message; for failure to deliver this message has been considered equal to not fulfilling the whole prophetic mission assigned by God. Therefore, the message can not be considered as a message about theological issues such as monotheism , prophethood or the resurrection or jurisprudential issues such as the rulings on prayer , fasting and Hajj , because Qur'an 5 is the last sura revealed to the Prophet (s) but those rulings have been sent down before the revelation of Qur'an 5. It can be said that it should be about an issue which is , in addition to importance and novelty, considered as a complement to the Prophet's (s) prophetic mission which is nothing but the leadership of the Muslim umma after the Prophet (s). The Prophet's Worry Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the Prophet (s) was worried about delivering the message, but God dispelled his worry by this phrase \"Allah shall protect you from people.\" As it was demonstrated, the verse is not about the polytheists of Quraysh nor about people of the book, the referent of \"people\" is hypocrites within the Islamic society. The Prophet (s) was worried about their opposition and sabotage because: Imam 'Ali (s) was known as a serious and inflexible person in religious matters. [15] Some new Muslim (specially from Quraysh) had grudge against 'Ali (a) as he had killed their relatives in the battles. 'Ali was young (when the Prophet (s) passed away he was thirty three). The Arab society was not going to easily accept him, since for them, age and senility was one of the most important requirements for leadership. This attitude towards leadership was reflected in objections which arose twice during the Prophet's (s) life: during the Battle of Tabuk when 'Ali (a) was appointed as the Prophet's successor in Medina, and appointment of Usama b. Zayd as the commander of the army in the last days of the Prophet's (s) life.

{"title": "Al-Tathir Verse", "text": "Al-Tathir Verse Verse's Information Name Al-Tathir Verse Sura al-Ahzab Verse 33 Juz' 22 Page 422 Content Information Place of Revelation Medina Topic Beliefs About Infallibility of Imams Related Verses al-Mubahila Verse Al-Taṭhīr verse (Arabic: آيَةُ التَّطهير , lit. the Verse of Purification) is a part of verse 33 of Sura al-Ahzab (Qur'an 33) in which God has repelled all the impurities from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and Shi'a theologians and scholars refer to this verse as a proof for the infallibility of Imams (a) . Text “ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّـهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا Indeed Allah desires to repel all impurity (rijs) from only you, Ahl al-Bayt (People of the Household), and purify you with a thorough purification. ” — Qur'an 33 :33 Occasion of Revelation It is reported in some narrations that the above verse was revealed in the house of Umm Salama , wife of the Prophet (s) ; and Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) , and al-Husayn (a) were there at the time of revelation of the verse. Then, the Holy Prophet (s) covered Ali (a), Fatima (a), al-Hasan (a), and al-Husayn (a) with his Kisa' (cloak) on which he was sitting and then stretched his hands towards the sky and said, \"O God! These four are my Ahl al-Bayt ; clean them of any impurities!\" Umm Salama asked the Prophet (s) if she was included in the Ahl al-Bayt (a)? The Prophet (s) answered her, \"You are among the Prophet's (s) wives and you are on a good path.\" Argument from the Verse With regard to how Aya al-Tathir implies the purity of Ahl al-Bayt (a) , it is said that the word, \"innamā\" (Arabic: إِنَّما ), denotes exclusiveness, as lexicographers have stipulated. Thus, the verse shows that God exclusively wills to purify Ahl al-Bayt (a). Given Arabic grammar, the verse involves some other emphases as well. Moreover, \"al-rijs\" (Arabic: الرِجسَ ) or impurity is used with a definite article (al-) and thus it connotes any type of impurity, be it mental or practical, such as polytheism , infidelity , hypocrisy , ignorance, and sins . Thus, the verse rejects the existence of all these kinds of impurity in Ahl al-Bayt (a). Meaning of Rijs Commentators have different opinions regarding the meaning of Rijs. They have suggested various meanings for this term including \"sin\", \"mischief\", \"polytheism\", \"doubt\", \"low desires\", etc. Shi'a commentators have regarded \"cleansing of Ahl al-Bayt (a) from impurities\" to mean \" infallibility from sins and having the opportunity of obedience.\" Members of Ahl al-Bayt Sunni View Commentators have different opinions on to whom the term Ahl al-Bayt (a) refer. Many companions of the Prophet (s) such as Anas b. Malik , Abu Sa'id al-Khudri , Umm Salama , Aisha , Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas , 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far , and 'Abd Allah b. al-'Abbas have considered Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) , and al-Husayn (a) the only members of the Ahl al-Bayt (a). There are narrations from other Imams of the Shi'a confirming this opinion. Another opinion is that the Ahl al-Bayt (a) referred to the Wives of the Prophet (s) since the context of the verse is about them. Hadiths with such implications have been narrated from 'Ikrima mawla Ibn al-'Abbas and Muqatil b. Sulayman. A third opinion attributed to Zayd b. Arqam , the companion of the Prophet (s), suggests that the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are those whom are prohibited by God to receive zakat and they are relatives of the Prophet (s) including Al 'Ali, Al 'Aqil and Al Ja'far and by Tathir in the verse under discussion, clearing them from reception of sadaqa (charity) and zakat is meant. There are different traditions in the Musnad Ahmad b. Hanbal , all of which refer to the fact that the Prophet (s) had mentioned Fatima (a), her husband (a), and her two sons as the reference for al-Tathir verse. He also narrates in Fada'il al-sahaba that for six months, when the Prophet (s) was passing by the house of Fatima (a) while going to the mosque for Fajr prayer , he (s) used to call them saying, \"O the Ahl al-Bayt (a), Prayer! Prayer! O Ahl al-Bayt (a)! Surely God wants to repel any impurities from you and cleanse you.\" Shi'a View The wording of the verse is in agreement with the first opinion above saying that Ali (a), Fatimah (s), al-Hasan (a), and al-Husayn (a) are the Ahl al-Bayt (a), because if the Ahl al-Bayt (a) were the wives of the Prophet (s), then the pronouns in the verse had to be feminine ('ankunna, عنکُنَّ ; and yutahhirakunna, یُطَهِّرَکُنَّ ) instead of masculine ('ankum, عنکم ; and yutahhirakum, یُطَهِّرَکُم ). There would be a question why there is something said among the duties of the wives of the Prophet (s) which does not relate to them, and the answer is that such style of speaking has been practiced by eloquent Arabs and we find numerous cases in the Qur'an where some sequential verses talk about different issues, also there are hadiths that such verses had been revealed in different times, but have been put beside each other at the time of compiling the Qur'an. That the verse has been revealed about Ashab al-Kisa' has been narrated so repeatedly that it has reached the level of tawatur . In addition, there are hadiths from Imams (a) of Shi'a that the Ahl al-Bayt (a) also include other Imams of Shi'a (a). In his commentary on the al-Tathir verse, Ibn Kathir , a Sunni scholar, mentions a narration from Imam al-Hasan (a) who has been saying on the pulpit, \"we are the Ahl al-Bayt (a) about whom God has revealed this verse [al-Tathir verse].\" He also narrates that Imam al-Sajjad (a) answered a man from Syria , \"We are meant by the Ahl al-Bayt (a) [in this verse].\" See Also Hadith al-Kisa' Ashab al-Kisa' Ahl al-Bayt (a) Notes References Events Books Related Theological Juristic Ethical Other Related"}
{"title": "Al-Wilaya Verse", "text": "Al-Wilaya Verse Verse's Information Name Al-Wilaya Verse Sura al-Ma'ida Verse 55 Juz' 6 Page 117 Content Information Cause of Revelation Imam Ali (a) Place of Revelation Medina Topic Beliefs About Imamate of Imam Ali (a) Related Verses al-Tabligh verse , al-Ikmal verse Al-Wilāya Verse (Arabic: آية الولاية ) is the verse 55 of Qur'an 5 (Sura al-Ma'ida) which has been revealed about Imam Ali (a) and has praised him. Shi'as refer to this verse as a proof for the wilayah of Imam 'Ali (a). Text “ إِنَّما وَلِيُّكُمُ اللَّهُ وَرَسولُهُ وَالَّذينَ آمَنُوا الَّذينَ يُقيمونَ الصَّلاةَ وَيُؤتونَ الزَّكاةَ وَهُم راكِعونَ Your guardian is only Allah, His Apostle, and the faithful who maintain the prayer and give the zakat while bowing down. ” — Quran 5:55 Occasion of Revelation This verse has been revealed about Imam 'Ali (a). This view is unanimously accepted by Shiite exegetes . It is almost the same among Sunni exegetes. In his Mawaqif , Qadi Iji has stipulated that exegetes unanimously believe that this verse has been revealed about 'Ali (a). Al-Jurjani in his commentary on Mawaqif , Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani in his Sharh-i maqasid and al-'Allama al-Hilli in commentary on Tajrid have confessed to this consensus. There are also some hadiths in some Sunni exegeses that claim this verse has been revealed about 'Abd Allah b. Salam, 'Ubada b. al-Samit , Abu Bakr and all muslims , however, none of them have strong bases. According to some hadiths : Once, a poor man entered al-Masjid al-Nabawi and asked for help, but no one helped him. He rose his hands to the sky and said: O Allah , witness that I asked for help in the mosque of Your Prophet (s) but no one helped me. Meanwhile, Imam 'Ali (a) who was praying and was in ruku' , signaled the poor with his right hand. The poor man came and took out the ring; and the verse was revealed. Narrators The occasion of the revelation (sabab al-nuzul) mentioned above has been narrated by the companions including: 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas , Abu Rafi' al-Madani , 'Ammar b. Yasir , Abu Dhar al-Ghifari , Anas b. Malik , Miqdad b. al-Aswad . From Tabi'un , Muslima b. Kuhayl , 'Utbat b. Abi Hakim , al-Suddi , and Mujahid have narrated this story. Indication of the Verse There's no doubt for Shi'a exegetes that in the verse by \"the faithful who maintain the prayer and give the zakat while bowing down\" Imam 'Ali (a) is meant, and also in the view of Sunni scholars the fame of the narration about the phrase of the verse being about Imam 'Ali (a) is to the extent that 'Adud al-Din al-Iji , the famous Sunni theologian, affirms in his book al-Mawaqif that the exegetes have ijma' (consensus) that this verse was revealed about 'Ali (a). al-Jurjani in Sharh al-mawaqif , Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani in Sharh al-maqasid , al-Qushchi in Sharh tajrid al-i'tiqad also have confirmed the ijma'. Great Sunni muhaddiths have narrated the hadith in their books, like: Hafiz 'Abd al-Razzaq al-San'ani, Hafiz 'Abd b. Hamid, Hafiz Razin b. Mu'awiya, Hafiz al-Nasa'i , Hafiz Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari , Ibn Abi Hatam, Ibn 'Asakir, Abu Bakr b. Murdawayh, Abu l-Qasim al-Tabrani, al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, al-Haythami, Ibn al-Jawzi, Muhibb al-Tabari, Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti , and al-Muttaqi al-Hindi . Al-Alusi says: most of the muhaddiths believe that the verse was revealed about 'Ali (a). Indication of the Wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) Shi'as have concluded the wilaya of 'Ali (a) from the verse , and some considered the verse as the strongest reason of his Imamate . The verse begins with \"Innama\" (Arabic: إنّما ) which, according to scholars of arab, indicates the exclusivity, so according to the verse, Allah , the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) are exclusively considered as wali . The word \"wali\" (Arabic: ولي ) is derived from Wilaya meaning the administrator and guardian. Ibn Manzur says: \"the wali of an orphan is someone who is responsible for his affairs, and the wali of a bride is her agent in concluding the marriage contract. Al-Fayyumi says: \"wali of a person is someone who is responsible for his affairs\". So the very meaning of wali is the administrator and someone who is responsible for someone else. Other meanings are derived from this meaning. It is narrated in al-Kafi from Imam al-Baqir (a) : Allah ordered his Prophet (s) about the wilayah of Imam 'Ali (a) [after the Prophet (s)] and revealed the al-Wilaya Verse and obligated the obedience of uli l-amr [in the Uli l-Amr Verse ], and people did not know what is this wilaya. Allah ordered His Prophet (s) to describe them wilaya as he had described prayer , zakat , fasting , and hajj . The Prophet (s) was worried about people turn from Islam and impugn him, so he referred to His God and Allah revealed al-Tabligh Verse : \"O Apostle! Communicate that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not, you will not have communicated His message, and Allah shall protect you from the people. Indeed Allah does not guide the faithless lot.\" So the Prophet (s) publicized the wilaya of 'Ali (a) in Ghadir Khumm and ordered the present to inform the absent. Al-'Ayyashi narrates an identical hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) .

{"title": "Giving Ring as Charity", "text": "Giving ring as charity refers to giving Imam Ali's (a) ring (khatam) to a beggar in the ruku' of his prayer . This event has been narrated in Shi'a and Sunni books of hadiths and according to exegetes , the verse of Wilaya was revealed about it. Giving ring as charity is mentioned among the merits of Imam Ali (a). Some shi'a jurists referred to it and concluded that: minor movements of the body in prayer, do not make it invalid. Some others have raised this question that hearing others during prayer is incompatible with descriptions of the mystical states of Imam Ali (a) during prayer. Some others have answered this question that both Imam Ali's (a) prayer and his giving were for God ; thus, there is no contradiction between the two. The Event According to some hadiths, one day a beggar entered the mosque of the Prophet (s) and asked for help; but, no one gave him anything. He raised his hands toward the sky and said, \"O God ! Witness that I asked for help in the mosque of Your Prophet (s) and no one gave me anything.\" When he said this, Imam Ali (a) was performing ruku' in prayer and pointed to the small finger of his right hand which had a ring on. The beggar went near and took the ring off from Imam 's (a) finger. This event is reported to have happened in 9 /630-1 or 10 /631-2. Revelation of al-Wilaya Verse Exegetes have considered the event of Imam Ali's (a) ring-giving as the context of the revelation of al-Wilaya verse. Qadi Iji said that there is a consensus among exegetes over the revelation of this verse about Ali (a) ; however, in some Sunni commentaries, it is mentioned that al-Wilaya verse was revealed about other people. Many companions of the Prophet (s) such as Ibn 'Abbas , 'Ammar , Abu Zhar , Anas b. Malik , Abu Rafi' and Miqdad have maintained that al-Wilaya verse had been revealed about Imam 'Ali (a) subsequent to giving away his ring. Imam 'Ali's ring-giving has been brought up in exegeses of the Qur'an and hadith books of both Shiite and Sunni scholars. Features of the Ring It is transmitted form Imam al-Sadiq (a) that the ring Imam Ali (a) gave to the beggar weighed four mithqals and its stone weighed five mithqals which was a red ruby, and its price was equal to the tax of Syria (three hundred camel-bearing parcels of silver and four camel-bearing parcels of gold). It belonged to Marwan b. Tawq who was killed by Imam Ali (a) in the war. Imam Ali (a) took the ring as a war booty to the Prophet (s) and the Prophet (s) gave it to him as a gift. Understandings in Fiqh Some Shi'a jurists refer to Imam Ali's (a) ring-giving in ruku' to prove that minor movements of the body do not make the prayer invalid. Also, some others have referred to it as an argument to prove that intention is an act of heart and does not need to be mentioned by the tongue. Also, since the verse refers to the ring-giving as zakat , they have deduced from it that zakat can include recommended acts of charity as well. Some have said that paying attention to the beggar and hearing his words in the prayer is incompatible with descriptions of the mystical states of Imam Ali (a) during prayer. Some others have answered this question, saying that both Imam Ali's (a) prayer and his giving were for God; thus, there is no problem if someone hears the voice of a beggar and also gives him for the sake of God; the same way that the Prophet (s) heard the voice of a crying child and finished the prayer faster than usual. 'Allama Majlisi said that paying attention to another person's prayer does not disagree with the perfection of prayer and presence of heart in the prayer.

Abi Talib (a) and his followers. Text and Translation \"Those who have and do righteous deeds, they are the best of creatures.\" Exegesis The verse has been interpreted by many hadiths in Shi'a and Sunni sources as being about Ali b.

Its chains go back to companions such as 'Abd Allah b. al-'Abbas , Abu Barza al-Aslami , and Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari .

According to the belief of Shi'a , the truthful refers to Ahl al-Bayt (a) . This verse is one of \"Qur'anic\" reasons of imamate of the twelve Imams (a) . Text and Translation “ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَكُونُوا مَعَ الصَّادِقِينَ ” “ O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah, and be with the Truthful ” — Quran 9 :119 Meaning of Truth Truth means the quality of being based on fact. In other words, truth is a description of a word that is based on fact. Belief and promise are also called \"word\", so these matters also could be described as truth. When someone has beliefs according to the fact or acts as he promises, he is in his beliefs and promises truthful. Al-Zamakhshari , one of Sunni exegetes, says: \"the truthful are who are truthful in their beliefs, word and behavior\". Who are \"the Truthful\" Burayd said: I asked Imam al-Baqir (a) about the Allah 's almighty saying as says: Be wary of Allah, and be with the Truthful; he (a) replied: We are meant. Al-Kulayni , Al-Kafi , vol.1 p.208 Exegetes believe differently about who are the truthful and what are their attributes. It is said that the truthful are who have the attributes mentioned in Qur'an 2 :177, or who are mentioned in Qur'an 33 :23 or are the emigrants who are described in Qur'an 59 :8 as the truthful. Some exegetes have referenced to qirā'a of 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud , and have considered the word \"with\" (Arabic: مع , \"ma'a\") meaning as \"from\" (Arabic: من , \"min\"); so believers must \"be wary Allah and be one of the truthful\". In Shi'a and Sunni hadiths , 'Ali (a) , or he and his companions, or he and his sons, or the Prophet Muhammad (s) and Ahl al-Bayt (a) are introduced as the truthful. Many of Shi'a hadiths interpret the truthful as Ahl al-Bayt (a). Al-Shaykh al-Saduq transmitted a hadith from Imam 'Ali (a) : When the al-Sadiqin verse was revealed, someone asked the Prophet (s) : \"the word \"truthful\" is general or specific?\" the Prophet (s) answered: \"the ones who are commanded to be with the truthful is general and includes all believers, but the truthful is specific and means my brother 'Ali and other successors of me until the judgment day\". The Truthful are \"Ahl al-Bayt\" Shi'a believes that the meaning of the truthful in the verse is the Prophet (s) and twelve Imams (a) and in some of the narrations only Ali (a) is mentioned, because he is the first Imam after the Prophet (s). In criticism of other views, it could be said that although in some of the verses of the Qur'an , the believers are called truthful, this does not mean that the truthful in the verse, are also all of the believers; because in the verse the truthful, are those who have the highest level of truth and only the infallibles have this status; the qira'a of 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud is also disapproved, because although in Arabic literature, the word \"with\" (Arabic: مع , \"ma'a\") is used with the meaning of \"from\" (Arabic: من , \"min\"), but this usage is not common and needs proof, while here is not such proof available. Moreover, this \"qira'a\" is transmitted by a few people and is not reliable. Reasons of Shi'a Al-'Allama al-Hilli glossing the word of al-Muhaqqiq al-Tusi , which considers the al-Sadiqin verse, one of reasons for imamate of 'Ali (a) , says: \"God commands believers to be with the truthful, and the truthful are the ones whose truth is known and this could be confirmed only for an infallible , because it is impossible to know the truth of a non-infallible and according to all of Muslims ( Consensus ), among the companions of the Prophet (s), no one is infallible except \"'Ali (a)\". [13] Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , one of great Sunni exegetes , considers the verse a reason for the infallibility of the truthful: \"the verse commands believers to wary Allah and be with the truthful. This means that believers are not infallible; and in order for them to be free of error, they must follow the ones who are free from error and they are truthful. This matter (fallibility of believers) is present all times, hence there must be an infallible all times so that believers could follow him.\" \"Fakhr al-Razi\" continues: \"Following the infallible is only possible when people know him, otherwise following him is commanding to something which is beyond power, and because we do not know anyone as infallible, there only remains \"consensus of umma \" to be the instance of the truthful and believers must follow them.\" [14] Discussion of Fakhr al-Razi that the truthful must be infallible, is correct; but describing \"consensus of umma\" as the instance for the truthful is not acceptable; because: Subjects on which all Muslims agree are very rare, and it cannot be sufficient for Muslims in religious affairs. If \"consensus of \"umma'\" does not include infallible persons there is still a possibility for error. The infallibility of Ahl al-Bayt (a) is clearly recognizable by referring to Tathir verse in Qur'an, and to hadith al-Thaqalayn , hadith of Safina , etc. in tradition of the Prophet (s) . [15] What makes the infallibility of the truthful stronger is that the command to be with the truthful is without any condition, two points can be acquired by this: The truthful are persons who are truthful in all their volitional actions, including beliefs, manner, speech, and behavior. They are truthful in their actions, beliefs, etc. all times. Obviously, these two are possible from an infallible person, so the truthful are the fourteen infallibles (a) , and believers must follow them.

{"title": "Trial of Ibrahim (a) Verse", "text": "Trial of Ibrahim (a) Verse Verse's Information Sura Qur'an 2 Verse 124 Juz' 1 Content Information Cause of Revelation Trial of Ibrahim (a) Place of Revelation Medina Topic Belief About Imamate of Ibrahim (a) Trial of Ibrāhīm (a) Verse or The Ibtilā Verse (Arabic: آية إبتلاء إبراهيم ) is the verse 124 of Qur'an 2 in which God appointed Ibrahim (a) (Abraham) as imam . Referring to this verse, Shi'a believe that imamate is a God-given position and that imam needs to be infallible . Text and Translation “ وَإِذِ ابتَلىٰ إِبراهيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِماتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قالَ إِنّي جاعِلُكَ لِلنّاسِ إِمامًا قالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتي قالَ لا يَنالُ عَهدِي الظّالِمينَ ” “ And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain kalimat (words), and he fulfilled them, He said: 'I am making you the Imam of mankind.' Said he: 'And from among my descendants?' He said: 'My pledge does not extend to the unjust ” — Quran 2 :124 Content In this verse, three points have drawn the attention of Muslim exegetes and theologians: What is the meaning of \"trying with words\", and what are the words with which God tested Ibrahim (a) ? What is the meaning of imamate which God granted Ibrahim (a) after he successfully passed the trials? What is the mentioned injustice which inhibits one from attaining the position of imamate? In other words, does this verse imply infallibility as the requirement of imamate? [1] Meaning of \"Kalimat\" (Words) There are different views about the meaning of \"kalimat\": It is narrated from Imam al-Sadiq (a) that Ibrahim's (s) trial was through his dream in which he saw that he was sacrificing his son , Isma'il (a) (Ishmael). It seems that this narration refers to one of the most important trials of Ibrahim (a), not excluding his trial, in the above verse, to sacrificing his son. About the verse, three interpretations are narrated from Ibn 'Abbas : The 10 orders related to the purity of body: madmada , istinshaq [inhalation], brushing teeth, circumcision, trimming mustache, etc. There are 30 Islamic qualities or instructions which are mentioned in the Qur'an, in Qur'an 9 :112, in Qur'an 33 :35 and Qur'an 23 :1-9. Hajj rituals . Al-Hasan al-Basri said that the \"trials\" are Ibrahim's (a) debate with the worshipers of stars, the moon, and the sun, throwing him into fire, his immigration and sacrificing his son, Isma'il (a). Abu 'Ali al-Juba'i said that Ibrahim's (a) trial was through intellectual and religious obligations. Al-Mujahid has said that the intended meaning of \"words\" was the phrase \"He said, 'I am making you the imam of mankind.'\" and its following verses. Accordingly, imamate is a part of Ibrahim's (a) trial, not a position he (a) was given afterwards. Amin al-Islam al-Tabrisi , after mentioning the above opinions, says that the verse could reflect them all. Discussion and Evaluation Since in the Qur'an , \"words\" do not refer to some parts of the statement, 'Allama Tabataba'i did not consider al-Mujahid's opinion worthy of any attention. After mentioning the above opinions except the first one, al-Tabari says that it is possible that all or some of the mentioned opinions would be meant because there is no authentic hadith about this. Ibn Kathir considered al-Mujahid's idea in conflict with the context of the verse, but said that other opinions would be right. Al-Qurtubi quoted from Abu Ishaq al-Zajjaj that different opinions are compatible with the interpretation of \"words\" because Ibrahim (a) was tested with all those. Even though the meaning of \"words\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an, but the context of the verse implies that whatever \"words\" have been, they have been important in proving Ibrahim's (a) competence for the position of imamate. Conclusion According to narrations received from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , God gave the position of imamate to Ibrahim (a) after the position of khulla (friendship). The position of khulla is when a human being becomes full of God's love and friendship and does not love anything but God and thus he would not save any act of devotion in the way of God. Accordingly, it can be said that trials such as being thrown onto fire by Nimrud , immigration from his homeland and, settling his family in the hot and arid land of Arabia and sacrificing his son, were all among the \"words\" and trials intended by the verse. Also, this point is clear that the mentioned trials took place during Ibrahim's (a) prophethood before he received his position of imamate. Ibrahim's (a) Position of Imamate There are different opinions in this regard as well: Universal Imamate First opinion: imamate is a quality specific to him. After passing important tests, he (a) was given the imamate of the people of his time and other times, including even the prophets ; i.e., everyone followed his monotheistic traditions. To support this opinion, some shreds of evidence are mentioned from the Qur'an , for example, to reject Jews and Christians ' claim that they related Ibrahim (a) to their religion at the time of the Prophet (s) , the Qur'an mentions that those who are the most worthy to be related with Ibrahim (a), are the Prophet (s), his followers, and those who followed Ibrahim (a) before Islam. In another verse , God revealed it to the Prophet (s) that he must follow Ibrahim's (a) religion and in another verse, introduced Islam, the same religion as the religion of Ibrahim (a). Criticisms and Evaluation This theory cannot be accepted due to the following reasons: Musa (a) (Moses), 'Isa (a) (Jesus) and the Prophet of Islam , each had an independent religion, and since every religion abrogates the religion previous to it, so it could not be said that these prophets (a) have been following Ibrahim's (a) religion. Accordingly, the intended meaning of the mentioned verses is the heart of Ibrahim's (a) religion which is monotheism and submission to divine orders and prohibitions, as it is mentioned in the Qur'an that, \"Indeed, with Allah the religion is Islam.\" [14] The Qur'an regards Ibrahim (a) as the follower of Nuh (a) (Noah), [15] and it is not meant that Ibrahim (a) was following the religion of Nuh (a); however, it means that Ibrahim (a) followed Nuh's (a) approach in the way of monotheism and fighting with polytheism and ignorance and thus following Ibrahim (a) by the prophets (s) after him, is the same. Ibrahim (a) asked God to grant imamate to his descendants, and God gave it to the pure ones among his descendants, as in the Qur'an mentioned about Ibrahim (a), Ishaq (a) (Isaac) and Ya'qub (a) (Jacob) that, \"We made them imams, guiding by Our command.\" [16] Therefore, imamate cannot be regarded among Ibrahim's (a) specific qualities. Prophethood Second opinion: some scholars have interpreted the imamate in this verse as the prophethood . Fakhr al-Din al-Razi approves this view and says: \"Firstly, from the phrase 'the Imam of the mankind', it can be understood that Ibrahim (a) was the imam of all people and that is a quality of the prophets (s) who brought a new religion; since otherwise, he would be a follower of another prophet which disagrees with the fact that he was \"the Imam of the mankind\". Secondly, the prophets, whether those who brought a religion or others, had the position of imamate, since following them was obligatory upon people. Thirdly, imamate in this verse is mentioned as a divine grace upon Ibrahim (a); therefore, imamate is the greatest divine blessing which is the prophethood.\" Criticism and Evaluation In al-Razi's viewpoint, the two statements mentioned firstly and secondly are not compatible with each other because, in the first statement, imamate of Ibrahim (a) has been regarded as the prophethood of those prophets who brought new religions, and in the second statement, it is regarded as the prophethood in its general sense. Also, the third statement does not prove his claim since to consider imamate as an act of grace is not compatible with considering imamate as prophethood. Moreover, undoubtedly, all or some of the trials Ibrahim (a) passed and made him worthy of the position of imamate, happened during his prophethood, and thus it is impossible to interpret imamate as prophethood. Another point that rejects al-Razi's view is that when Ibrahim (a) received the position of imamate from God, he asked it for his children as well, and this shows that Ibrahim (a) either had children then or at least was sure to have one because he would not ask his request provided that he would have any children. Also, we know that Ibrahim (a) had no children until he (a) was old and he (a) was disappointed to have any child in a natural way and when angels gave him the good news that he (a) would have children, \"He said, 'Do you give me good news though old age has befallen me? What is the good news that you bring me?'\" Thus, he (a) received the position of imamate at the end of his prophethood, after he (a) received the good news of having children. A Perfect Exemplar Third opinion: imamate in this verse refers to Ibrahim's (a) quality of being a perfect exemplar. The condition of reaching this position is that the person reaches a level of spiritual perfection that he (a) does not even commit a \" Tark al-Awla \" (abandoning the better). Even though the prophets (s) before Ibrahim (a) were infallible, but according to the Qur'an, they sometimes committed something, abandoning which was preferred. These prophets (s) did not reach such a position as of Ibrahim (a), and their speech and actions cannot be regarded as the perfect example for mankind for all ages, but after passing difficult trials, Ibrahim (a) reached a position which is considered a perfect exemplar for all the mankind. Criticism and Evaluation As mentioned before, imamate has been given to pure ones in the progeny of Ibrahim (a) such as Ishaq (a) (Isaac) and Ya'qub (a) (Jacob), and undoubtedly the spiritual perfection and position of \" Ulu l-'Azm \" prophets such as Nuh (a) (Noah), Musa (a) (Moses) and 'Isa (a) (Jesus) have been greater than those ones in the children of Ibrahim (a) and that Ulu l-'Azm prophets have been given the position of imamate; therefore, Ibrahim (a) alone cannot be regarded as the perfect exemplar of the mankind. Political Leadership and Wilayah Fourth opinion: some exegetes have interpreted imamate in this verse as political leadership and Wilayah. The justification for such an interpretation is that political leadership and Wilayah is not a part of prophethood and its relation with prophethood is partial in subject and aspect; i.e., some prophets have had political leadership and Wilayah in addition to their position of prophethood and many others have not had such a position, like Imams (a) had political leadership and Wilayah, but they were not prophets. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi has mentioned this opinion in al-Tibyan . In a treatise, he wrote about this issue, he says, \"The word 'imam' is used in two cases, one who is the leader of others in words and deeds and another who rises as a political leader to manage the society. In the first usage, a prophet and an imam are the same because every prophet is an exemplar for others in words and deeds; but, in the second usage, it is not the same. Since there are prophets sent only to deliver divine orders to people, and not assigned for the political leadership of the society.\" Then, al-Shaykh al-Tusi has given reasons to distinguish the meaning of prophethood from imamate in its meaning of political leadership: from the verse about Talut 's ruling, it can be inferred that the prophet was not having imamate and ruling together at that time; since, if it was so, people would not ask him to appoint a ruler for them. Also, if he was in the position of ruling, people would not say that, \"we are more competent to rule than Talut\", but they would say that, \"you are more competent to rule than Talut.\" Harun (a) (Aaron) was a partner of Musa (a) in his prophethood, but he did not have the position of imamate as managing social affairs, because when Musa wanted to go to Miqat , he (a) appointed Harun (a) as his deputy, so if Harun (a) had the position of imamate, he did not need to be appointed as the deputy. God gave the position of imamate to Ibrahim (a) after prophethood and after he (a) successfully passed divine trials; therefore, the prophethood of Ibrahim (a) was not at the same time with his imamate. [22] Amin al-Islam al-Tabrisi approved this viewpoint. [23] Criticism and Evaluation The Qur'an considers judgment in arguments as one of the purposes of prophethood and states: The issues that al-Shaykh al-Tusi mentions for distinguishing between prophethood and imamate do not prove his claim. About the prophet of Banu Israel at the time of Talut , that people asked the Prophet (s) to appoint a ruler for their war with the enemies is an obvious reason for the fact that they regarded commanding the army among the duties of the prophet (s) and also the Prophet (s) accepted their request and did not say that it is not among the duties of prophethood. But, that people thought themselves more competent for ruling than Talut was because they judged that based on wealth and popularity. That was why the prophet (s) described Talut's physical and intellectual competencies and rejected people's judgments. Even though Harun (a) had the merits of imamate, with the presence of Musa (a) who was an Ulu l-'Azm prophet and had the political leadership of the society, there was no grounds for Harun (a) to exert political imamate; and thus everything had to be carried out following Musa's order. Also, if Ibrahim's (a) imamate meant to be political leadership, it did not need such grave trials. In political leadership, more than spiritual merits, competence, and wisdom in social leadership are required and prophets (s), as the best of people of their times, had such qualities, especially that they were infallible in knowledge and action. Spiritual Guidance Fifth opinion: from Allama Tabataba'i 's viewpoint, imamate in this verse is spiritual guidance; which is not of the nature of guiding the way, but it is of the nature of reaching the desired and bringing one to the desired. Such guidance requires having a special spiritual perfection and position, which is achieved after great struggles. To prove this opinion, 'Allama refers to some verses of the Qur'an: Verses which mention prophet's guiding after mentioning their position of imamate such as, \"And amongst them, We appointed imams to guide [the people] by Our command, when they had been patient and had conviction in Our signs.\" [25] Verses which explain divine order, \"All His command, when He wills something, is to say to it 'Be,' and it is. So immaculate is He in whose hand is the dominion of all things and to whom you shall be brought back.\" [26] Verses which state that perfect knowledge and true certainty requires that people go beyond the appearance of the world to see the heart of things, as the Qur'an mentions about Ibrahim (a) that, \"Thus did We show Ibrahim the dominions of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who possess certitude.\" [27] From these verses, the following points are inferred: Imamate and guidance are together; i.e., guidance is the special feature of imamate and its introducing sign; thus, imamate without guidance and guidance without imamate is impossible to imagine. The mentioned guidance is happened by the will of God . Achieving the position of imamate and guidance can be achieved by divine will through patience in the way of God and certitude in the signs of God. Since patience is mentioned unconditionally, it includes any patience in the way of God, bearing hardships and steadfastness in divine trials. This patience is the fruit of the perfect knowledge and certitude in the signs of God. Divine will is actually the spiritual aspect of things, and every creature connects with God from its spiritual aspect. Therefore, an imam must be one of the people of certitude, meaning that they see the spiritual aspect of the universe, and using such knowledge, he can enter competent hearts through their spiritual dimension and guide them towards God. Therefore, the journey of people towards God and their achievement to the desired perfection can happen through imam's inner and spiritual influence, the same as during the apparent life of imam, when he shows the way of happiness to human beings. Thus, imam's guidance has two apparent and spiritual aspects. Spiritual Guidance has Levels According to verses 72 and 73 of Qur'an 21 which shows the imamate of Ishaq (a) and Jacob (a) and their lack of any special privileges over other prophets regarding imamate and definiteness of the imamate of Ulu l-'Azm prophets , the commonness of imamate for divine prophets cannot be rejected. However, imamate as spiritually guiding and reaching the desired has different levels relative to every prophet's capacity, but all of them have the position of imamate. Proofs for the Infallibility of Imams Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's Reasoning From the phrase \"I am making you the Imam of mankind.\", Fakhr al-Din al-Razi infers Ibrahim's (a) infallibility so that imam is one who is followed, if he commits a sin , following him in that sin becomes obligatory, but it is wrong; since an action is a sin if it is forbidden and since following an imam is obligatory, therefore, following that action becomes obligatory; while action cannot be obligatory and forbidden at the same time. Twelver Shi'a Reasoning Twelver Shi'a theologians and exegetes refer to the phrase \"My pledge does not extend to the unjust.\" and say that one who commits sin has done injustice because he has broken the rules of God and according to the Qur'an , \"…and whoever transgresses the bounds of Allah —it is they who are the wrongdoers.\" and also God says \"My pledge does not extend to the unjust.\" where the pledge refers to imamate , since the phrase \"I am making you the Imam of mankind.\" has come before that. Also, Ibrahim (a) asked God to give imamate to his children, and God answered, \"My pledge does not extend to the unjust.\"; therefore, if the pledge here does not mean imamate, then the answer would be irrelevant to the request. Question and Answer It is said that \"Zalim\" (the unjust) is one who firstly, commits a great sin; and secondly, does not repent of his sin. But, a sinner who does repent is not called a Zalim (the unjust). The answer is that the negation in the phrase \"My pledge does not extend to the unjust.\" is absolute and means that anyone who can be called an unjust person at any moment of his life would not receive imamate and conditioning this phrase needs a reason which is non-existent. Second Answer: Here, regarding the existence of definite evidence, those who commit a sin and then repent would not receive the pledge of imamate, as Ibrahim's (a) children can be categorized into four groups: Those who were unjust at the beginning but then repented and were on the right path for the rest of their lives; Those who were not unjust at the beginning but became unjust later and were the same until the end of their lives; Those who were unjust from the beginning until the end of their lives; Those who could never be called unjust. Undoubtedly, Ibrahim (a) did not ask God to give imamate to the second and third groups among his children. Only the first and fourth groups could be the ones he (a) asked God to give imamate to. On the other hand, the phrase \"My pledge does not extend to the unjust.\" implies that the first group could not receive imamate; therefore, only the fourth group could receive imamate; i.e., those who never committed any action which could be an example of injustice.

{"title": "Al-Ikmal Verse", "text": "Al-Ikmal Verse Verse's Information Name Al-Ikmal Verse Sura Qur'an 5 Verse 3 Juz' 6 Content Information Cause of Revelation Appointment of Ali (a) as successor Place of Revelation Mecca About Imam Ali (a) and Event of Ghadir Related Verses Al-Tabligh verse , Al-Wilaya verse Al-Ikmal verse (Arabic: آية الإكمال ) is the third verse of Chapter 5 of the Qur'an (Sura al-Ma'ida) which was revealed to the Prophet (s) during the event of Ghadir . In this verse, God states that he has perfected the religion and completed his blessing. There is a disagreement about the day in which this verse was revealed . Some scholars maintain that it was revealed on the day of 'Arafa and some believe that the 18th of Dhu l-Hijja of 10/ March 16 , 632 is the day. Shi'a unanimously believe that the verse was revealed about the event of Ghadir and the guardianship ( Wilaya ) of Imam 'Ali (a) . Text “ الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا \"Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam as your religion.\" ” — Qur'an 5:3 Time of Revelation There are two groups of narrations in Shi'a and Sunni sources about the exact time of its revelation. It was definitely revealed during Hajjat al-Wida' (farewell Hajj), however, some have said it was revealed on the Day of 'Arafa or and some have narrated that it was revealed on the 18th of Dhu l-Hijja , the Day of Ghadir . Day of 'Arafa In al-Kafi , al-Kulayni has narrated a hadith which says this verse was revealed on the day of 'Arafa to announce the guardianship of 'Ali (a) ; however al-'Allama al-Majlisi said that this hadith has weak and unreliable chain of narrators as well as distorted content . Al-'Ayyashi also narrated from Imam al-Sadiq (a) : \"When the Messenger of God stayed in 'Arafat on a Friday, Gabriel came to him and said: \"O, Muhammad! God sends you salutation and says: Tell your Umma (community) \"Today, I have perfected your religion by the guardianship of 'Ali b. Abi Talib and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam as your religion and I will not reveal anything after this.\" In the chain of narrators of this hadith, there is a person named Ja'far b. Muhammad al-Khuza'i whose identity is unknown. Moreover, some Sunni sources including an exegesis of the Qur'an and a history book authored by Ibn Kathir , maintain that it was revealed on the day of 'Arafa . 18th of Dhu al-Hijja According to several hadiths, Ikmal verse was revealed on the day of Ghadir or soon after. These hadiths have been narrated in Shiite sources through numerous sahih (correct) chains of transmission. Some Sunni sources also maintain that it was revealed on the Day of Ghadir, however, some other Sunnis believe that those hadiths are weak and unreliable. Narrators in the chain of transmitters are trusted according to Sunni scholars of rijal , though. 'Allama Amini has checked all the narrators of these hadiths according to Sunni Rijal books and principles and concluded that all of them are reliable from Sunni point of view. Both Days Some scholars believe that this verse was revealed twice, once, on the day of 'Arafa - and the Prophet (s) , for some reasons, was worried to inform people about it after which al-Tabligh Verse was revealed and God assured him in that verse; then al-Ikmal verse was revealed once again - on the day of Ghadir. Occasion of Revelation Shi'a Viewpoint Shi'a unanimously believe that Ikmal verse was revealed about the event of Ghadir and the guardianship ( Wilaya ) of 'Ali (a) . Sunni Viewpoint Some Sunni sources reported that the verse was revealed on day of 'Arafa. However, 'Allama Amini in al-Ghadir and Mir Hamid Husayn in 'Abaqat al-Anwar have found ample indications in Sunni sources that it was revealed about 'Ali (s). Analysis When the al-Tabligh Verse was revealed in Ghadir Khumm , the Prophet (s) appointed 'Ali (a) as the guardian and caliph following which the Ikmal verse was revealed. Then the Prophet said: \"God is the greatest upon perfection of the religion and completion of blessing and God's satisfaction with my messengerhood and 'Ali's guardianship after me.\" According to this, announcing the guardianship of Ali (a) was the last duty of the Prophet (s) and nothing was sent down after that except the Ikmal verse. Word Description Today ( ) There are different opinions about the referent of \"Today\" in the verse: The day of Conquest of Mecca [14] : considering the fact that many rulings were introduced after the Conquest of Mecca and a religion cannot be perfect without complete rulings, this report is not acceptable. [15] After the Battle of Tabuk : it was then that Qur'an 9 was revealed and the traditions of the Age of Ignorance were broken. [16] This report is not acceptable either, because Qur'an 5 in which many rulings are issued was revealed after Qur'an 9. [17] The day of 'Arafa: Bukhari , Muslim and some other Sunni sources have said that it was the day of 'Arafa. [18] It is unacceptable too, as some rulings were issued after 'Arafa in 10/632 including a report narrated from 'Umar that the ruling to forbid Riba was issued after Hajjat al-Wida' (farewell Hajj). [19] The day of Ghadir: the only issue that is as important as it can be considered to be the cause of perfection of the religion and completion of blessing and disappointment of unbelievers is the guardianship of 'Ali (a) and appointing him as the Prophet's (s) vicegerent during the event of Ghadir . Difference between Completion and Perfection Completion is applied where various parts of something come in a sequence and it is not complete unless all parts are assembled. When the last part joins the other parts we can say it is complete. But in the case of perfection, it is not that there is an incomplete issue. An item may be complete but still not perfect. In fact, the difference between completion and perfection is the same as the difference between quantity and quality. Qur'an says, on the one hand, that I have completed your religion and says, on the other hand, that I have perfected my blessings.

{"title": "Tablets of Moses (a)", "text": "Tablets of Moses (a) or Alwāḥ Mūsā (Arabic: ألواح موسی ) are two tablets sent down to the Prophet Moses (a) on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed. Upon witnessing the Israelites worshiping a calf, Moses (a) was infuriated and threw the tablets on the ground. According to Islamic sources, the broken pieces of tablets survived among the Israelites and were kept in the Ark of the Covenant . However, according to the Torah , Moses (a) went to Mount Sinai again, where another set of Tablets were sent down to him. Divine Revelation The divine revelation was inscribed on stone tablets and was then sent down to Moses (a). The Torah narrates the story as follows: “ Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the covenant in his hands, tablets that were written on both sides, written on the front and on the back. The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets. ” — Exodus 32:15-16 Although the Qur'an is not explicit on the tablets being sent down in the \"tryst\" (mīqāt) , it does say that when Prophet Moses (a) returned from the \"mīqāt\" and witnessed people worshiping a calf, he (a) threw down the tablets , and when he (a) calmed down, he (a) picked up the broken pieces of the tablets again Some Exegetes of the Qur'an such as 'Allama Tabataba'i believe that the tablets mentioned in the Qur'an are the same tablets mentioned in the Torah. Others maintain that they were sent down before the revelation of the Torah. Rashid Rida , the author of al-Minar , says about the relationship between the tablets and the Torah: \"The Tablets were the first part of shari'a (religious law). Indeed, they were a concise version of the Torah, and then detailed rulings regarding worships, transactions, and the like were gradually revealed on different occasions. The same type of revelation is true of the Qur'an as well\". The tablets were kept in the Ark of the Covenant in the Solomon's Temple . Eventually, after Nebuchadnezzar 's invasion of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple, the Ark of the Covenant and tablets inside it were lost. According to some hadiths , after his reappearance , Imam al-Mahdi (a) will bring out the Ark of the Covenant and tablets inside it from a cave in Antioch . Number The Torah is explicit that there were two Tablets: \"The two Tablets of the covenant\" . The Qur'an talks about \"alwah\" without referring to the number. Thus, there are different views among exegetes of the Qur'an with respect to the number of the tablets. Some of them believe that \"alwaḥ\", which is in plural form, was used instead of the dual form (muthanna), that is \"lawḥayn\" (Arabic: لَوْحَیْن ), so the tablets were two. Contents The Qur'an characterizes the contents of the Tablets as follows without going into the details: And We wrote for him in the Tablets advice concerning all things and an elaboration of all things. [12] He (Moses) picked up the tablets whose inscriptions contained guidance and mercy for those who are in awe of their Lord. [13] The Torah cites the whole content of the two Tablets which is known as the Ten Commandments . Breakage of the Tablets The Prophet Moses (a) spent 40 days in Mount Sinai . When he returned, he brought with him the tablets on which the revelation was engraved. But when he witnessed the Children of Israel worshiping a calf, he was infuriated and threw down the tablets, and they broke. Some exegetes of the Qur'an believe that the reason why Moses (a) broke the Tablets was his anger of calf-worshiping by the Israelites. Here is how the Torah narrates the story: “ As soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets from his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain. ” — Exodus 32:19 Renewed Descent of the Tablets The Torah narrates the story of the second Tablets as follows: “ The Lord said to Moses, “Cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you broke. Be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to me, on the top of the mountain. No one shall come up with you, and do not let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; and do not let flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.” So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the former ones; and he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tablets of stone. ” — Exodus 34:1-4 However, the Qur'an and other Islamic sources are not explicit about the second Tablets. Many exegetes of the Qur'an believe that the broken pieces of the first tablets survived among the Israelites and were kept in the Ark of the Covenant .

{"title": "Ark of the Covenant", "text": "Ark of the Covenant or Tābūt al-ʿAhd (Arabic: تابوت العهد ) was an important box which Israelites kept for centuries and was very precious and sacred to them. The Qur'an referred to it as an \"ark\" and considered it a cause of tranquility for Israelites. It contained valuable and important articles such as the tablets of Moses (a), Staff of Moses (a) , etc. Introduction Ark of the Covenant, also called \"ark of the tranquility\" and \"ark of the testimony\", refers to an important box which Israelites kept for centuries and was very precious and holy to them. The word \"tabut\" (ark) is used twice in the Qur'an: Once, the mother of Moses (a) put her son in ark (box or basket) and casted in Nile river . [1] In the story of choosing Talut (Saul) as the king and carrying Tabut (Ark of the Covenant) as the sign; which contained tranquility from God , heritage of the family of Moses (a) and Aaron (a) and angels carried it. [2] \"Tabut\" in this story is the famous Ark of the Covenant. [3] Making of the Ark Islamic and non-Islamic sources have different narrations about the emergence of this ark (tabut): The Qur'an has used the word \"tabut\" once referring to the ark, addressing to the mother of Moses (a), \"Put him in the casket, and cast it into the river. Then the river will cast it on the bank\". It is narrated from Imam al-Baqir (a) that, the box, mother of Moses (a) put him in it and casted into the river was later received by Israelites and became very important to them. It was with them during the Exodus. Then, they put the tablets of Moses (a) , etc. in it. In other words, it was actually the Ark of the Covenant. Some Shi'a exegetes have accepted this view. Some Sunni exegetes believe that God gave prophet Adam (a) an ark and it was passed from one prophet to the next and it was this Ark of the Covenant. Torah has mentioned that the making of the Ark of the covenant was after the Exodus . About the time and the way this ark (tabut) was made, the Qur'an does not mention anything. But, there are many narrations about the details of the description of this ark (tabut), some exegetes consider them among israelites which cannot be relied upon. Contrary to the Qur'an, Torah has discussed extensively about how the Ark of the Covenant was made and has mentioned its details. Destiny Ark of the Covenant became very famous and sacred after the Exodus of Israelites from Egypt . During the years of their wandering in the desert, Ark of the Covenant was kept in a sacred tent (tabernacle) and there were very strict rulings about it. After Prophet Moses (a) and the end of 40 years of wandering in the desert, Israelites went toward the holy land together with Joshua (a) . Ark of the Covenant was an important and influential symbol to Israelites. They placed it in front of their army in different battles and defeated their enemies. But, when they opposed their prophets and disobeyed the orders of God , they were defeated and in some of their defeats, their enemies took the Ark of the Covenant from them; however, after a while, they received it back. The Qur'an has mentioned one of these incidents and mentioned carrying the Ark of the Covenant a sign of the kingdom of Talut (Saul), \"Their prophet said to them, 'Indeed the sign of his kingship shall be that the Ark will come to you, bearing tranquility from your Lord \" According to this verse , God considered a sign for the king and the prophet should try to make people understand this and avoid their division. Ultimately, after the attack of Nebuchadnezzar to Jerusalem and destruction of the temple , the Ark of the Covenant was lost. According to some hadiths , it is among the trusts of Imamate and Imam al-Mahdi (a) will take out the Ark of the Covenant from a cave in Antioch . Contents of the Ark of the Covenant The Qur'an has generally referred to the content of the Ark of the Covenant, \"The relics left behind by the House of Moses and the House of Aaron\" Exegetes have mentioned that it contained different articles, including the tablets of Moses (a) , Staff of Moses (a) , and belongings of other prophets. In a letter to Hebrews (mentioned in the New Testament), Paul the Apostle mentioned the tablets of Moses (a), a golden pot of manna (the bread God supplied as food for the Israelites in the wilderness) and the staff of Moses (a) which once budded as contents of the Ark of Covenant. Its Effects and Miracles The Qur'an describes this tabut, \"bearing tranquility from your Lord\" Different interpretations have been mentioned for it. In any case, it conveys tranquility of the heart which the Ark of the Covenant brought to Israelites. Holy book of Jews has mentioned different miracles for it: After the demise of prophet Moses (a) , Israelites wanted to pass river Jordan, so they carried the Ark (tabut) in the lead preceding the people like before and entered the river. For the miracle of the Ark, the river split and water condensed at the top and Israelites stepped on dry ground and proceeded their way. Notes References Verses Events Books Beliefs Related"}
{"title": "Verse of Witness", "text": "Verse of Witness Verse's Information Name Shahid verse Sura Quran 11 Verse 17 Juz' 12 Content Information Cause of Revelation Reassuring and inspirit the Prophet (s) Place of Revelation Mecca About Imam 'Ali (a) as the witness for prophethood Related Verses Al-Mubahala Verse The Verse of Witness or al-Shāhid Verse (Arabic: آية الشاهد ) concerns the proofs for the Prophet’s prophethood from the Quran , earlier scriptures, and truthful believers . It was revealed when polytheists accused the Prophet (s) of falsehood. The verse was revealed to reassure and inspirit the Prophet (s). In Shi'a and Sunni sources of hadiths and Quranic exegesis , the “witness” in the verse is said to be Imam ʿAli (a) , although there are other interpretations such as Gabriel , the Prophet’s tongue, and the Qurʾan as well. The Verse of Witness is adduced as evidence for Imam ʿAli’s guardianship and caliphate , since according to the verse, the “witness” in question should be the Prophet’s own soul, and according to the Verse of Mubahala , Imam ʿAli (a) was the Prophet’s own soul. Text and Translation “ أَفَمَن کانَ عَلَیٰ بَینَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ وَیتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ وَمِن قَبْلِهِ کتَابُ مُوسَیٰ إِمَامًا وَرَحْمَةً ۚ أُولَٰئِک یؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَن یکفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ ۚ فَلَا تَک فِی مِرْیةٍ مِّنْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّک وَلَٰکنَّ أَکثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا یؤْمِنُونَ ﴿۱۷﴾ Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord, and whom a witness of his own [family] follows? And before him there was the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy. It is they who have faith in it, and whoever defies him from among the factions, the Fire is their tryst. So do not be in doubt about it; it is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not have faith. ” — Qur'an 11 :17 Content In his al-Mizan , ʿAllama Tabatabaʾi takes the Verse of Witness to be a reassurance to the Prophet (s) and reinforcement of his faith in the Book of God . On his account, the verse was revealed concerning accusations raised by polytheists to the effect that the Prophet (s) was a liar. In the Quranic exegeses, Majmaʿ al-bayan and Tafsir-i nimuna , two interpretations of the verses are offered: On the first interpretation, the phrase “Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord” refers to the Prophet (s) himself in that his prophethood can be proved in three ways: The Quran as a manifest proof or evidence, Earlier scriptures such as the Torah in which the Prophet’s signs have been mentioned, His loyal followers and truthful believers such as ʿAli b. Abi Talib (a), as they are evidence for the truth of a religion. [2] On the other interpretation, the phrase “Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord” refers to all believers who believed in the Prophet (s) and eagerly followed the Quran through manifest convincing proofs as well as evidence for the Prophet’s truthfulness in earlier scriptures. [3] The term “bayyina” (manifest proof) in the verse is said to mean obvious things that not only make themselves manifest, but also bring other things into light. Who is the Witness? There are different interpretations offered by Quranic exegetes about what is meant by the word “witness” in verse 17 of Quran 11 . In many Shi'a and Sunni books of hadith and exegesis, the “witness” is taken to refer to Imam ʿAli (a) as the first person who believed in the Prophet (s). There is a hadith in which Imam ʿAli (a) cites himself as the “witness” in this verse. In his Shawahid al-tanzil , al-Hakim al-Haskani cites over sixteen hadiths to support the view that Imam ʿAli (a) was the witness in this verses. A case in point is a hadith from Anas b. Malik to the effect that the phrase “Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord” refers to Muhammad (s) and the phrase “and whom a witness of his own [family] follows” refers to ʿAli b. Abi Talib (a). The hadith continues by saying that ʿAli (a) was the Prophet’s tongue toward people of Mecca when they violated their treaty. In another hadith, al-Haskani quotes Ibn ʿAbbas as saying that the “witness” in the phrase “and whom a witness of his own [family] follows” uniquely refers to Imam ʿAli (a). There are other accounts of the referent of the “witness” in this verse as well. According to Fadl b. Hasan al-Tabrisi in his Majmaʿ al-bayan , Ibn ʿAbbas and Mujahid, two early Muslim exegetes of the Quran, have interpreted the “witness” as referring to Gabriel who carried the Quran from God to the Prophet (s) . On another account, the “witness” is said to refer to the Prophet’s tongue and gestures as means of recitation of the Quran. On yet another account, the proof is said to be rational evidence and the witness is said to be the Quran itself. 'Allama Tabataba'i rejects other accounts of the verse, and drawing on certain hadiths , he argues that the phrase “and whom a witness of his own [family] follows” refers to Imam ʿAli (a). Implications for Imam ʿAli’s Guardianship and Caliphate The Verse of Witness is also adduced as a proof for the position of guardianship and caliphate for Imam ʿAli (a). According to some researchers, the term “yatlūh” in this verse means to follow, rather than recitation , because the masculine pronoun in this term as well as the pronoun in “minh” (from his own) refer to “he who.” It follows that “from his own” is evidence for an essential spiritual relation between the witness and the Prophet (s); that is, the witness here is the Prophet’s own soul. Moreover, since the verb “follows” implies continuity, it is said to imply that the witness follows the Prophet (s) in all degrees and at all times. Such attributes can only be established through the position of guardianship and caliphate or succession of the Prophet (s). The instance of such a position, according to hadiths and Quranic verses such as the Verse of Mubahala , is said to be Imam ʿAli (a). Why Reference is Made to the Torah The Verse of Witness refers to the Torah from among the earlier scriptures. According to Quranic exegetes, this is because Jewish thoughts were more prevalent in the milieu in which the Quran was revealed, since Christians lived in more distant areas such as Levant and Yemen . Moreover, it is said that the Prophet’s attributes have been more comprehensively mentioned in the Torah. Notes References Verses Hadiths Events Epithets Books Related"}
{"title": "Ulu l-Amr Verse", "text": "Ulu l-Amr Verse Verse's Information Name Ulu l-Amr Verse Sura al-Nisa' Verse 59 Juz' 5 Page 87 Content Information Cause of Revelation Has Place of Revelation Medina Topic Beliefs About Infallibility and Imamate of Imams Related Verses Wilaya Verse , Ahl al-Dhikr Verse Ulu l-Amr verse (Arabic: آیة أولي الأمر ) or the Iṭāʿa (Arabic: إطاعة , obedience) verse is the verse 59 of Qur'an 4 (Sura al-Nisa') which commands believers to obey God , the Prophet (s) , and Ulu l-Amr (those vested with authority). The verse is one of the Qur'anic proofs for the infallibility and imamate of Imam 'Ali (a) and other Imams (a) . Verse \"O, you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority (Ulu l-Amr) among you. And if you dispute concerning anything, refer it to Allah and the Apostle, if you have faith in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and more favorable in outcome.\" ( Quran 4 :59) Context of Revelation A Muslim and a Jew had a dispute over a subject. The Jew said, \"Let's go to Muhammad (s) for judgment\", the Jew knew that the Prophet (s) would not accept bribe; but the Muslim said, \"Let's go to Ka'b b. Ashraf\" because the Muslim knew that he will accept bribe and will judge for him. After the event, the verse of \"Ulu l-Amr\" revealed and commanded the believers to obey God, the Prophet (s), and Ulu l-Amr; and in times of any dispute refer to God and his Prophet (s). Indication that Ulu l-Amr are Infallible In the view of the Shi'a exegetes , there's no doubt that the verse indicates the infallibility of Ulu l-Amr. The reasoning is based on two main points: When God commands to obey someone unconditionally, it results in his infallibility; because if he is fallible and commands us to commit a sin , at the same time, we must obey him (because God commanded us to do so), and not obey him (because we must not commit sins). [2] The word Ulu l-Amr is mentioned immediately after the word al-Rasul (Prophet) and because the obedience of the Prophet (s) is unconditionally necessary, due to his infallibility, so the obedience of Ulu l-Amr is also unconditional. So it results in the infallibility of Ulu l-Amr. [3] In addition to Shi'a scholars, some Sunni scholars, such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi accepts that the verse indicates the infallibility of Ulu l-Amr. Instances of Ulu l-Amr Although Fakhr al-Din al-Razi accepts that the verse indicates the infallibility of Ulu l-Amr; he considers its instance, the consensus of Muslims and claims that we cannot identify the infallible and recognize them. However, there are many hadiths in Shi'a sources which explain that the instance of Ulu l-Amr are the Shia Imams (a): Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari says, \"When the verse was revealed, I asked the Prophet (s) , 'We know God and his Prophet (s), but who are Ulu l-Amr that God attached their obedience to your obedience?', the Prophet (s) said, 'They are my successors and imams of Muslims after me, first of them is 'Ali , then al-Hasan , then al-Husayn , then 'Ali b. al-Husayn , then Muhammad b. 'Ali ,…' [6] Imam al-Baqir (a) says in the exegesis of the verse, \"Ulu l-Amr are from the children of 'Ali (a) and Fatima (a) , till the Day of Judgment .\" He also said, \"By Ulu l-Amr, God only intended us and commanded all the faithful to obey us until the Day of Judgment.\" [7] Imam al-Sadiq (a) says, \"Ulu l-Amr are 'Ali b. Abi Talib, al-Hasan, al-Husayn, 'Ali b. al-Husayn, Muhammad b. 'Ali and me, praise God that introduced your imams and leaders to you when people deny them.

{"title": "Al-Ghadir fi l-kitab wa l-sunna wa l-adab (book)", "text": "Al-Ghadir fi l-kitab wa l-sunnat wa l-adab Author Abd al-Husayn Amini Original title Language Arabic Series 11 volumes Subject Wilaya and successorship of Imam Ali (a) (Arabic: الغدير في الکتاب و السنة و الأدب , lit.: [Event of] Ghadir in the book and tradition and literature) is the title of an eleven-volume book by Allama Amini that proves and defends the immediate and successorship of Imam Ali (a) to the Prophet of Islam (s) . The author regards the Hadith al-Ghadir as the most authentic and mutawatir (numerously reported) narration from the Holy Prophet (s) . To prove this, he has compiled the chains of narration of this hadith from Sahaba (companions of the Prophet (s)) and Tabi'un (companions of the companions of the Prophet (s)) to the scholars of the 14th/20th century from Sunni books to show the mutawatir nature of the hadith. In addition to such numerous chains of narration, the author extensively reports poems from Sahaba, Tabi'un, and later generations to substantiate his case. Among these discussions, he firmly replies to some of the accusations made by some Sunni scholars against Shi'a , using principles that are accepted in the Sunni faith. Among the discussions of the book are discussions about the religious knowledge of the first three caliphs and some of its consequences. For compiling the book, Amini travelled to different countries to use their libraries. He says I referred to more than one hundred thousand books and read more than ten thousand of them completely. Writing al-Ghadir took more than forty years. Author Abd al-Husayn Amini was born in 1320/1902-3 in Tabriz , Iran . He had elementary education in his hometown. Later he moved to Najaf and benefited from great scholars there. He received the certificate of ijtihad from great Marja's such as al-Sayyid Abu l-Hasan al-Isfahani (d. 1365/1946) Mirza Muhammad Hussein Na'ini (d. 1355/1936) and Shaykh 'Abd al-Karim Ha'iri Yazdi (d. 1355 /1937) and other scholars when he was a young student. In each of these certificates, his scholarly achievements and religious and social status are mentioned and praised. To find sources for his book, al-Ghadir , Allama Amini made a lot of journeys. In these travels, he would search for private or public libraries. He found, studied, and copied sources and citations from different books of these libraries. He would also meet with teachers and spread the message of Shi'a in scholarly circles; sometimes, he had speeches or led the congregational prayer . Among the cities he traveled with such program were: Hyderabad , Aligarh , Lucknow , Kanpur, Jalali, Rampur, (in India ) Fu'ah, Ma'rifa, Cairo , Aleppo , Nubl , Damascus and … . Volumes Al-Ghadir fi l-kitab wa l-sunna wa l-adab (lit.: [Event of] Ghadir in the Book [the Qur'an ] and tradition and literature) has been chosen as the title for the book to indicate that the denial of the Hadith al-Ghadir , entails the denial of the Qur'an, Prophet's (s) narrations and tradition, Arabic literature and poetic heritage, for the author has proven his case by providing different shreds of evidence from each of these sources. In al-Ghadir , around 150 books from among the most important sources of Muslims' literature and tradition –from various fields- that have shaped personalities and societies, are being used, and their content has been discussed and scrutinized according to the principles that are accepted in Sunni tradition. Therefore, it can be safely claimed that the author of al-Ghadir has accomplished a kind of academic reconstruction and has critically evaluated the general Islamic literature, for the very 150 books that are discussed -from the Tarikh of al-Tabari to the Fajr al-Islam by Ahmad Amin- provide standards and criteria for hundreds of other books and hundreds of other issues. First Volume In this volume, after presenting the text of Hadith al-Ghadir , the author mentions 110 individuals of Sahaba (companions of the Prophet (s)) who have narrated this hadith and cites the report from each of these individuals from Sunni traditional sources. After the Sahaba, he mentions 84 individuals of Tabi'un (the companions of the companions of the Prophet (s)) who reported this hadith. He also presents the opinions of Sunni rijal experts on these narrators. After Tabi'un, the name of 360 Sunni scholars -from the 2nd/8th to 14th/20th centuries- are listed that have narrated and documented this Hadith in their works. In the next chapter of the book, the authors who have dedicated a single specific book to Hadith al-Ghadir are listed. In the following chapter, the arguments in which Hadith al-Ghadir was cited are reported. The next topic of the first volume is the Qur'anic verses concerning the Event of Ghadir , then the Eid al-Ghadir and its position in the school of Ahl al-Bayt (a) is discussed, also the report in which Umar and Abu Bakr offer congratulations to Imam Ali (a) is presented. After this, the opinions and words of some Sunni scholars regarding Hadith al-Ghadir and its chain of narration are reported and discussed. Ending discussions of this volume are about the content and meaning of this hadith. In this regard, the author first reports some of the doubts given by some Sunni scholars concerning the meaning of hadith. Then, he provides various textual and contextual indications to clarify the meaning of the hadith. Second Volume The second volume of al-Ghadir deals with the poems about Ghadir.

He mentions some poems by Amir al-Mu'minin (a) , Hassan b. Thabit , Qays b. Sa'd b. 'Ubada , Amr b. al-'As , and Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah al-Himyari through authentic historical sources.

Later he starts a discussion about Zayd al-Shahid (Zayd the martyr) and Shi'a opinion about him, responding to some of the critiques made by Sunni scholars. Then the author extensively deals with some of the accusations made by some Sunni scholars against Shi'a and refutes them. In this process, he discusses some topics such as the virtues of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the Qur'an and the accusation of tahrif and mut'a . The remaining part of this volume includes Ghadir poets from the 4th/10th century: Ibn Tabataba al-Isfahani , Ibn 'Alawiyya al-Isfahani , al-Mufajja' , Abu l-Qasim al-Sanawbari , Qadi Tanukhi , Abu l-Qasim Zahi , and Abu Firas al-Hamdani .

Then it discusses the exaggerations that exist in the historical reports about Abu Bakr 's virtues, and then the discussion about his religious knowledge and some discussions about the issue of Fadak are followed. The ending part of this volume is about the faith of Abu Talib , and to prove this, the author presents various facts and pieces of evidence like Abu Talib's poems, his sayings, and activities, and some narrations from the infallibles (a) . Eighth Volume This volume begins with the continuation of the discussion about the faith of Abu Talib; in this part, some of the doubts that are produced by misinterpretation of some Qur'anic verses are discussed and responded to. The remaining part of this volume is about the exaggerations about Abu Bakr and Umar . Then the exaggerations made about 'Uthman are brought up, and his extensive gifts and giveaway from bayt al-mal (treasury) to his relatives and banishing Abu Dhar to Rabadha are reported and discussed. Ninth Volume The discussions of this volume are about some of the reported virtues of 'Uthman, his mistreatment toward Ibn Mas'ud and 'Ammar b. Yasir , and banishing the righteous of Kufa to Syria . The words and opinions of some of the Companions of the Prophet (s) about 'Uthman, and the story of his assassination are among the content of this volume. Tenth Volume The beginning of this volume is the continuation of reported exaggerations about the first three caliphs' virtues. It is followed by the story of Ibn Umar and his mistakes, including giving allegiance to Yazid .

The last part of this volume includes the list of Ghadir poets from the 9th/15th to 12th/18th century. At the end of the book, the author promises that the next volume (12th) would contain the remaining list of Ghadir poets, which remains unfulfilled due to the demise of the author. Status Critics and researchers consider al-Ghadir as a kind of encyclopedia which includes different discussions about Islamic heritage in history, theology and apologetics, hadith , diraya (the science of analyzing the text of reports), rijal (the science of analyzing the chains of transmitters of each report), tafsir (Qur'anic exegesis), history of Qur'an's revelation , history of Ghadir literature, critical analysis of the tradition, correction and bibliography. The book is written in a consistent and nice style, wise manner, poetic prose, with abundant sources, epic and solid expression, limitless feelings, far-reaching inspiration, living honesty, and complete decisiveness. After the publication of al-Ghadir and considering the discussions in this book, the work of any later researcher in Islamic tradition and history who lacks proper knowledge of these discussions, would not be deemed as trustworthy. For instance, if a researcher writes about hadith science in Islam without having read the fifth volume of al-Ghadir (on the chain of fabricators and liars), or writes about sects and denominations without having read the third volume, or talks about the foundations and principles of Shia creed without proper knowledge of the first, second, and seventh volumes of al-Ghadir , without a doubt, that piece of work will be considered imperfect. Some of the critics' opinions are as follows: Dr. Muhammad Ghallab al-Misri: Al-Ghadir , the dreamland of researchers. Muhammad 'Abd al-Ghani Hasan al-Misri: Al-Ghadir , the great encyclopedia. Dr. 'Abd al-Rahman Kayali al-Halabi: Al-Ghadir , any Muslim must have one copy of it. Dr. Tawfiq al-Fakiki al-Baghdadi: Al-Ghadir , palatable water and a rare encyclopedia. 'Abd al-Fattah 'Abd al-Maqsud al-Misri: Al-Ghadir , the vast universe of knowledge. Dr. Bulis Salama al-Bayruti: Al-Ghadir , the ascertaining book of history and the opening of horizons of knowledge. Dr. 'Ali Akbar Fayyad: Al-Ghadir , the wavy ocean. Al-Shaykh Muhammad Sa'id al-Dahduh al-Halabi: Al-Ghadir , all the events of history and forms of time. Al-Sayyid Sharaf al-Din al-'Amili: Al-Ghadir , the unique scholarly endeavour. 'Ala' al-Din Khrufa al-Azhari: Al-Ghadir , a horrendous book. Muhammad Taysir al-Makhzumi al-Shami: Al-Ghadir , a book different from other books. Yusuf As'ad Daghir Bayruti: Al-Ghadir , an ocean with waves. Publication, Translation, and Summarization Since the time of authorship, the eleventh volumes of al-Ghadir have been repeatedly printed. Currently, there are two main prints of this book: The old print (Tehran: Dar al-Kutub al-Islamiyya, 1372 AH /1952-3, Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-'Arabi 1387 AH/1967-8) which was followed by numerous re-prints. The refined and verified version by: Markaz al-Ghadir li-l-Dirasat al-Islamiyya. Its first print was released in 1416/1995-6. This version, which appears in a new format, has gone through additional research and contains explanations and citations in footnotes. [29] Al-Ghadir has been translated to Farsi , Urdu , and English. Also, there are Arabic, Urdu, and Turkish summaries of the book. Among other later works on this book are: creating indexes of figures and topics (titled: ' Ala difaf al-Ghadir [on the banks of Ghadir] and al-Munir fi faharis al-Ghadir ), some additional parts written by al-Sayyid 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Tabataba'i , and different books in Farsi and Urdu, that were inspired by al-Ghadir .

{"title": "Al-Ifsah fi l-imama (book)", "text": "Al-Ifsah fi l-imama Author Al-Shaykh al-Mufid Original title Language Arabic Series 1 vol. Subject Imamate Genre Theology Published Qom Publisher Mu'assisa al-Bi'tha (Arabic: الإفصاح في الإمامة ) is a book proving Shi'a beliefs about imamate and succession of Prophet Muhammad (s) . The author of the book, al-Shaykh al-Mufid , tried to collect whatever must be mentioned about imamate in this work. He believed that the subject of imamate was not discussed in such details in previous works. Using theological arguments, the author answered the problems about imamate and beliefs of various Islamic sects, such as Mu'tazila , Hashwiyya , and Khawarij . Author Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Nu'man, well-known as al-Shaykh al-Mufid, was born near Baghdad in 336 /947-8. He was both a theologian and a faqih (jurisprudent). Ibn al-Nadim has mentioned his soubriquet \"Ibn al-Mu'allim\" (son of the teacher) and praised him. Style The author's style in writing the book is mostly polemical; therefore, sometimes he even uses analogies for proving his contentions. The author has imagined an imaginary questioner who has many questions about imamate . The questions and problems are introduced as \"fa in qal\" (if he says) and the answers are given after \"qil-a lahu\" (he will be told). Al-Shaykh al-Mufid authored this book in 373/983-4. Cause of Writing According to what the author said in the introduction of the book, he wanted to depict the principles of imamate and leadership in Islam, in a way that readers could reach its ancillaries and branches through that principles. By writing this book, the author intended to determine the limits and definition of imamate. Structure and Content Although the book lack a coherent structure, its content can be categorized in an introduction, 18 sections, 7 chapters, and 7 issues. In the introduction, the author explained the purpose of writing the book and discussed various topics and issues about imamate , such as: definition of imamate, knowing the Imam , necessity of knowing the Imam, consensus on imamate of Imam Ali (a) , consensus of Muslims that there is an Imam after the Prophet (s) , superiority of Imam Ali (a) before God and the Prophet (a), refutation of imamate of the inferior over the superior, consensus on the virtues of Imam Ali (a), the reason that Imam Ali's (a) right was denied, Muhajirun and Ansar did not confirm the superiority of Abu Bakr , why Imam Ali (a) remained silent during the reign of the Three Caliphs , there was no consensus of Umma on the imamate of Abu Bakr, and so on. Chapter one: deals with three topics: The claim of impeccability of the council of Saqifa Issues about the Battle of Uhud Interpretation of Hadith al-'Ashara Chapter two: deals with many cases including that the word \"al-sabiqun\" in the 100th verse of Sura al-Tawba does not refer to Abu Bakr and those who were present in Bay'at al-Shajara (Allegiance of the Tree). Chapter three: in this chapter the author demonstrates the imamate of Imam Ali (s) according to the 16th verse of Sura al-Fath and that whoever fight against him is an unbeliever. Chapter Four: refuting the imamate of Abu Bakr according to the 117th verse of Sura al-Baqara and proving the imamate of Imam Ali (a) based on the same verse. Chapter five: refuting the argument on superiority of Abu Bakr according to the 29th verse of Sura al-Fath. Chapter six: rejecting the claim that the 33rd verse of Sura al-Zumar was revealed about Abu Bakr and proving that it was revealed about Imam Ali (a). Chapter seven: in the last chapter, the author talks about catastrophic consequences of the caliphate of other caliphs before Imam Ali (a). Characteristics Presenting the content in question-and-answer style: the author benefited the most form this style, which is a way of criticizing and examining the opponents' opinions, and presented very detailed discussions about Imamate using this style. Comprehensiveness of the book: although al-Shaykh al-Mufid has authored other books and treatises about imamate and other theological topics, this book has explained and clarified every hidden corner of the topic of Imamate and study most issues about it. Proving the necessity of knowing the Imam: at the beginning of the book the author has put forth a concise demonstration, based on the Qur'an , hadith , consensus and reason, that proves the necessity of knowing the Imam. Importance Although several books have remained from al-Shaykh al-Mufid about theology and particularly imamate, al-Ifsah is his most comprehensive and detailed book on imamate. This work is the only book that contains all aspects and issues about imamate. Manuscripts and Publication The book has several manuscripts, such as those in: The library of Astan Quds Razavi .

{"title": "Al-Muraja'at (book)", "text": "Al-Muraja'at Al-Muraja'at Author Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din Original title Language Arabic Subject Interfaith dialogue Genre Dialogue Published 2001 Publisher Ansariyan Publications Pages 520 English translation En. title En. publisher Imam Husayn (as) Islamic Foundation Beirut; Ansariyan Publications (Arabic: المُراجَعات ) is a revealing book about the truth of Shiism and the immediate imamate of Imam 'Ali (a) after the Prophet (s) . It contains letters communicated between Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din , a well-known Shiite scholar in Lebanon and al-Shaykh Salim al-Bishri , a well-known Sunni scholar in Egypt . To further examine all the doubts expressed by Sunni scholars, the book makes several arguments on the issue of imamate of Imam 'Ali based on the holy Quran and Sunni accepted sources of hadiths in this regard. More importantly, the reliability of its sources, references along with its inspiring style of writing are the reasons it has received wide acceptance. Two scholars The book's author, Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din al-Musawi al-'Amili (b. 1290 /1873-4 - d. 1377/1957) was a Lebanese Shiite Mujtahid and a supporter of the idea of the proximity of Islamic sects (especially Shiism and Sunnism)—he made remarkable efforts to unify both schools and resolve tensions between them. He was a leader of the Lebanese Independence Movement. Al-Shaykh Salim al-Bishri al-Maliki , a Sunni scholar, was the head of al-Azhar in Egypt for two terms. During his travel to Egypt in 1329 A.H./ 1911, Sharaf al-Din visited al-Bishri. There was debate between them about Sunni and Shiite beliefs when they met—a debate that continued throughout the 112 letters between them. They decided to publish their exchanges, but Sharaf al-Din postponed it because of his political and social struggles. In 1338 A.H./ 1919-20, French occupiers raided his house and his personal library, and burned some of his writings. Fortunately the letters, later called al-Muraja'at , were undamaged. Sharaf al-Din compiled the letters in the form of a book and published them. In the preface to the book, Sharaf al-Din says that he has included all exchanges between him and al-Bishri in the book. The book was first published in 1355 A.H./ 1936-7 in Sayda, Lebanon . Features The written form of the debates in book, has the advantage that the two parties had the opportunity to provide the best possible replies they could give. The book is written without any disrespect and under mutual fairness. This is one of the most important books that provides a well-argued account of Shiite beliefs, drawing upon reliable sources with a persuasive tone. The book is also called al-Munazarat al-Azhariyya wa al-mubahathat al-Misriyya (Debates in al-Azhar and discussions in Egypt). Content Shiites believe that the Prophet (s) has repeatedly announced 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) as his immediate successor, but Sunni Muslims believe that the Prophet (s) died without choosing a successor after him. In this book, Sharaf al-Din appealed to the Quran and hadiths in Sunni sources to prove Shiite beliefs and reply to their dissents. The book is made up of two parts: First : Shiism and imamat, 16 letters. The reason why Shiites have not followed the Four Sunni schools of jurisprudence and followed the school of Ahl al-Bayt (a) . That the views of Sunni scholars have no preference over Shiism. The place of Ahl al-Bayt (a) in Islam Suggestion to resolve the disputes between Sunnis and Shiites Evidence from the Quran and hadiths to prove the superiority of Ahl al-Bayt (a). Hadith al-Thaqalayn and its tawatur (being frequently narrated). Hadiths from the Prophet (s), including Hadith al-Safina , concerning the place of Ahl al-Bayt (a). What is meant by \"Ahl al-Bayt\" in the Quran and hadiths. The appeal of 12 Sunni scholars to Shiite narrators of hadiths in al-Sihah al-Sitta (the most important sources of Sunni hadiths). One hundred Shiite narrators of hadiths considered as reliable by Sunni scholars. Al-Bishri's acknowledgment that it is sufficient to follow the school of Ahl al-Bayt along with Sunni schools. Second : A detailed treatment of imamate and the khilafa of the Prophet (s), 93 letters. Many hadiths in Sunni sources, such as Hadith al-Indhar , Hadith al-Manzila , the first and the second Fraternity Agreement , the story of closing all the doors to the Prophet (s)'s mosque except the door of 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a)'s house Hadiths showing the superiority of Imam 'Ali (a) over all others. The Wilaya Verse and the meaning of wilaya in Quranic verses and hadiths The hadith of Ghadir and its tawatur , (being Mutawatir ). Forty hadiths in Shiite sources and the reason why Sunnis did not cite them. 'Ali (a) as the heir and the \"wasi\" (successor) of the Prophet (s). The Prophet (s)'s wives and the reason why 'Ayisha 's hadiths are accepted but Umm Salama 's hadiths are rejected. Lack of consensus about the khilafa of people other than 'Ali (a). The reason why Imam 'Ali (a) did not insist on pursuing his right to khilafa after a while. Hadith of Qirtas and the disrespect of the Prophet (s) by some of his Sahaba (companions) in the last days of his life. That some Sahaba defied Usama b. Zayd 's army and the Prophet (s) cursed them. A reply to the objection that it is improbable for Sahaba to have disobeyed the Prophet (s)'s order that 'Ali (a) should be his successor, and so there was no such order. The arguments by Imam 'Ali (a), Fatima al-Zahra (a) and some Sahaba against the usurpation of caliphate . The superiority of Shiites in compiling Islamic and other disciplines. Value The book counts as equivalent to precious works, such as 'Abaqat al-anwar by Mir Hamid Husayn al-Hindi , Ihqaq al-haqq by Qadi Nur Allah al-Shushtari and al-Ghadir by 'Allama Amini , which are devoted to defending, and arguing for, the truth of Shiism and the immediate khilafa of Imam 'Ali (a) . When it was published, al-Muraja'at was welcomed by readers and scholars; it was translated into different languages, and was widely published. Some Sunni scholars have attacked the book in order to defend their own viewpoints, but their attacks have been replied to by some Shiite scholars. One such reply is Tashyid al-Muraja'at wa tanfid al-mukabarat by Sayyid 'Ali al-Husayni al-Milani . Translations and Researches The book is originally in Arabic, and there are several translations for it. Al-Muraja'at is translated into English by Yasin al-Jiburi under the title al-Muraja'at: a shi'a-sunni dialogue . Farsi translations A translation by Sardar Kabuli under the title Munazarat-i Shia wa Sunni (Shiite and Sunni debates).

{"title": "Hadith al-Wisaya", "text": "Hadith al-Wisaya Subject Immediate caliphate and succession of Imam Ali (a) Issued by Prophet Muhammad (s) Main narrator Burayda b. al-Husayb Narrators Salman al-Farsi • Abu Ayyub al-Ansari • Anas b. Malik Shi'a sources Man la yahduruh al-faqih • Dala'il al-imama • Manaqib Al Abi Talib Sunni sources • Manaqib al-Imam Ali b. Abi Talib Ḥadith of Wisāya (Arabic: حدیث الوصایة ) is a hadith from the Prophet (s) , in which Imam Ali (a) is introduced as the Wasi and caliph . This hadith is mentioned in different wordings in Shi'a and Sunni sources. One of the famous narrations of the hadith of Wisaya transmitted by Burayda b. Husayb from the Prophet (s) is, \"for every prophet, there is a guardian and heir and surly Ali (a) is my guardian and heir\". Text Hadith of Wisaya is mentioned in Shi'a and Sunni sources such as Fadail al-Sahaba by Ibn Hanbal, Manaqib by Ibn al-Maghazili, al-Mu'jam al-kabir by al-Tabarani, Tarikh Madina Dimashq , al-Manaqib by al-Khwarazmi , al-Kamil by al-Gurgani, Tadhkirat al-khawas , Kifayat al-athar , Man la yahduruh al-faqih , Dala'il al-Imama , al-Manaqib by Ibn Shahr Ashub , and Bihar al-anwar . 'Abd Allah b. Burayda narrated from the Prophet (s) saying that, \"for every prophet, there is a guardian and heir and surly Ali (a) is my guardian and heir\". In reply to Salman al-Farsi who asked the Prophet (s) about his guardian and caliph, the Prophet (s) said, \"My guardian and heir and the one who will pay my debts and will fulfill my promises is Ali b. Abi Talib (a) .\" Also, based on a hadith transmitted by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari , once the Prophet (s) addressed Lady Fatima al-Zahra (a) that, \"my guardian is the best of guardians and the most beloved among them before God and that is your husband.\" Content Hadith of Wisaya is about the caliphate and succession of Imam Ali (a). Shi'a scholars consider it among the arguments for the imamate of Ali b. Abi Talib (a). They interpret \"wisaya\" as \"succession\" and believe that the Prophet (s) introduced Imam Ali (a) as his successor in this hadith. But, some Sunni scholars say that in this hadith, \"wisaya\" does not mean caliphate, and the Prophet (a) has actually advised Ali (a) about his households. They have been answered and criticized that here the Prophet (a) has mentioned Imam Ali (a) as his successor in an absolute way and there is no evidence that he (s) limited \"wisaya\" to his family affairs. In the research version of al-Mu'jam al-kabir , Hamdi b. 'Abd al-Majid Salafi said that if the chain of the transmission for this hadith were correct, it would imply the issue of caliphate and succession. Chain of Transmission Hadith of Wisaya has been mentioned in Sunni sources with different chains of transmission, from Burayda, Salman , Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and Anas b. Malik . Sibt b. al-Jawzi (author of Tadhkirat al-khawas ) transmitted the narration of Salman in two ways. He considers the chain of transmission mentioned by Ibn Hanbal 's Fada'il al-sahaba correct. Some Sunni scholars such as Ibn al-Jawzi, Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti and al-Haythami doubted in the chain of transmission of this hadith and did not accept it; while, some researchers have criticized these Sunni scholars.

{"title": "Al-Nass wa l-ijtihad (book)", "text": "Al-Nass wa l-ijtihad Author Al-Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din Original title Language Arabic Series 1 vol. Genre Theology Publisher Dar al-Qari • Uswa Publication • Dar al-Ta'aruf • Maktabat Narjis English translation En. title En. publisher Ansariyan Publications, Qom En. full text www.al-islam.org/al-nass-wal-ijtihad (Arabic: النَّص و الاِجتِهاد ) or (Arabic: الاجتهاد فی مقابل النص ) is a book concerning imamate and caliphate written by Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din al-'Amili , a Lebanese scholar. The book is concerned with proofs for the superiority of Imam Ali (a) . It cites about hundred cases in which caliphs and some companions opposed the Qur'an and explicit words of the Prophet (s) . Without evaluating these oppositions, the author only cites them from the main Sunni sources. Al-Sayyid Muhammad Taqi al-Hakim wrote a relatively long introduction to the book. The book was translated into Persian and English. The Persian translator of the book is Ali Dawani . Author Sayyid 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din al-Musawi al-'Amili (b. 1290 /1873-4 - d. 1377 /1957) was a Shi'a mujtahid in Lebanon and an advocate of the proximity of Islamic sects. He made a great deal of efforts to unify Shi'as and Sunnis and to solve the roots of their disagreements. He was also a leader of the Lebanese Independence Movement. He wrote this book when he was about eighty years old. His best-known book is al-Muraja'at which concerns the immediate succession of Amir al-Mu'minin 'Ali (a) as the first Imam after the Prophet (s) . Title The word, \"nass\", means an explicit word or sentence whose meaning is obvious, having no more than one meaning in a way that it cannot be interpreted in different ways. The word, \"ijtihad\", literally means to try and attempt, and terminologically it means the deduction of the rulings of sharia from reliable sources. \"Nass\" in the title of the book refers to explicit words of God and the Prophet (s), and by \"ijtihad\" the terminological meaning is meant. The phrase, \"ijtihad in the face of nass\", is a term in principles of jurisprudence meaning to exercise one's personal opinion in the face of the explicit words of God and the Prophet (s). Contents The book consists of eight chapters, enumerating hundred cases in which early caliphs, rulers, and some of their associates exercised \"ijtihad\" in the face of \"nass\" (that is, exercised their personal opinions in the face of explicit words by the Prophet (s)) during or after the Prophet's (s) period. The author leaves the judgment to the reader. Sharaf al-Din expresses his scholarly and critical views with respect to each of these cases. These oppositions to explicit words of the Prophet (s) are of two types: some are not compatible with any principle (even according to Sunni views), and some are out of ignorance of the real ruling which were corrected after learning about the real rulings. Below are some cases of such ijtihads (personal opinions): Ijtihads by the First Caliph In the first chapter of the book, Sharaf al-Din enumerates the cases in which the first caliph, Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa , exercised his own personal opinions in the face of explicit words by God or the Prophet (s): The story of Saqifa Opposition to the commandership of Zayd b. Haritha Refusal to join the army of Usama b. Zayd Rejecting the share of \"those whose hearts are made to incline to Islam\" Rejecting the share of \"kinsmen\" Usurpation of Fadak Disobeying the Prophet's (s) order to kill Dhu l-Thadya twice Fighting those who failed to pay zakat to him His overlooking Malik b. Nuwayra being killed at the command of Khalid b. Walid Prohibition of writing the Prophet's (s) hadiths Agreeing with some polytheists who wanted to take back their slaves who had converted to Islam. Ijtihads by the Second Caliph In the second chapter of the book, Sharaf al-Din enumerates cases in which the second caliph, 'Umar b. al-Khattab , exercised his personal opinions in the face of opposing words by God and the Prophet (s): Audacity in front of the Prophet (s), preventing his will to be written Objection to the Hudaybiyya Peace Treaty Objection to the Prophet (s) when he said that worshippers of God will go to the Heaven Prohibition of Hajj al-Tamattu' Prohibition of temporary marriage (mut'a) Heresy (bid'a) in adhan for morning prayer Heresy in adhan and iqama The third divorce Tarawih Prayer Four takbirs in funeral prayer Ignorance of some obvious rulings of the sharia Permitting a grandfather to inherit from the dead although the departed has a brother Permitting an uncle to inherit from his sister's child 'Idda for a pregnant woman after her husband's death Permitting a woman whose husband is lost to get married Selling bondwomen who have children Not saying prayer when there is no water Prohibition of saying two rak'as of recommended prayer after the afternoon prayer Relocating the Maqam Ibrhaim Prohibition of crying for the dead Violating the rulings of fasting in the early days of Islam Drinking wine even after the revelation of Quranic verses in which wine was declared as forbidden , which made the Prophet (s) so angry that he hit 'Umar with something that was in his hand The Prophet's (s) prohibition of killing 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib and Banu Hashim in the Battle of Badr and 'Umar's insistence on killing them Killing the prisoners of the Battle of Hunayn Escaping the battlefield Inspecting the houses of Muslims His heresy in determining mahr for women Changing the hadd of theft, ignoring it in the case of servants who had stolen things Whipping a person for an extra-marital sexual intercourse although it was not proved Ignoring the hadd of adultery in the case of Mughira b. Shu'ba Exiling Dabi' al-Tamimi and hitting him because he had asked questions about difficult verses of the Qur'an Inappropriate exile of Nasr b. Hajjaj Exceeding the hadd on his son twice Cutting the tree of Hudaybiyya Umm Hani 's complaint of 'Umar His negligence of Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan 's actions Issuing orders that were against the sharia, and canceling them after learning that they were against the sharia Ijtihads of the Third Caliph In the third chapter of the book, Sharaf al-Din enumerates cases in which the third caliph, 'Uthman b. 'Affan , exercised his personal opinions in the face of explicit words by God and the Prophet (s): Donation from the public treasury (bayt al-mal) to his kinsmen Respecting people who were banished by the Prophet (s) Saying complete prayer on travel Ijtihads by Aisha In the fourth chapter of the book, Sharaf al-Din enumerates cases in which Aisha exercised her personal opinions in the case of explicit words by God and the Prophet (s): Saying complete prayer on travel Aisha's defamation of Mariya , the Prophet's (s) wife The Prophet's (s) marriage to Asma' Juniyya Hafsa and Aisha's conspiracy against the Prophet (s) Hafsa and Aisha ordered to make repentance Objection to the Prophet (s) Reproaching 'Uthman and ordering his murder Her hadiths from the Prophet (s) Her riot against 'Ali b.

{"title": "Al-Shafi fi l-imama (book)", "text": "Al-Shafi fi l-imama Author Al-Sayyid al-Murtada Series 4 volumes Subject Imamate Published 1301AH/1989 Publisher Mu'assisa-yi Intisharati-yi al-Sadiq (Arabic: الشافي في الإمامة ) is a theological book concerning imamate in Arabic, written by al-Sayyid al-Murtada 'Alam al-Huda (355/-436 AH). The book was written in reply to objections by al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar al-Mu'tazili concerning imamate. The book, al-Shafi , was a focus of the attention of Muslim scholars, as they wrote critiques and summaries for it. A well-known example is al-Shaykh al-Tusi 's Talkhis al-shafi . Al-Sayyid al-Murtada cited al-Shafi in other works of his, such as Tanzih al-anbiya' and al-Dhakhira fi 'ilm al-kalam . Al-Shafi was lithographically printed in Iran in 1301/1883-4. Moreover, it was published in 1410/1989-90 by al-Sadiq Publishing Institute in four volumes as edited by 'Abd al-Zahra' Khatib Husayni. Author The author of al-Shafi is al-Sayyid al-Murtada (355/966-436/1044), the well-known imami jurist and theologian. He became the Shiite authority after al-Shaykh al-Mufid 's demise. His teachers included Al-Shaykh al-Mufid, Al-Husayn b. 'Ali b. Babawayh the brother of al-Shaykh al-Saduq , Ibn Nubata al-Sa'di , 'Ali al-Marzbani . His students included al-Shaykh al-Tusi , Sallar al-Daylami , Ibn al-Barraj , Muhammad b. 'Ali al-Karajaki Al-Sayyid al-Murtada adopted a rationalistic approach to theological issues. For this reason, in the case of prima facie contradictions between reason and textual evidence (i. e. , Quranic verses and hadiths), he preferred reason and interpreted the text away. Al-Sayyid al-Murtada developed his theological views in books such as al-Dhakhira fi 'ilm al-kalam , Tanzih al-anbiya' , al-Muqni' fi l-ghayba , Jumal al-'ilm wa-l-'amal , and al-Fusul al-mukhtara . Title Al-Sayyid al-Murtada himself refers to the book as al-Shafi fi l-imama . The same title is mentioned by Ahmad b. 'Ali al-Najashi and al-Shaykh al-Tusi. Aqa Buzurg Tihrani , however, refers to the book as al-Shafi fi l-imama wa ibtal hujaj al-'amma . Motivation for Writing According to Aqa Buzurg Tihrani in his al-Dhari'a , al-Sayyid al-Murtada's motivation for writing al-Shafi was to reply to the objections raised by al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar al-Mu'tazili about the imami denomination, particularly about imamate . Al-Sayyid al-Murtada himself says in al-Shafi that he sought to write an elaborate book in critique of al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar, but he did not find an occasion to do so. For this reason, he rested content with writing al-Shafi . Place in Islamic Theology The book al-Shafi dates back to the fifth/eleventh century. Shiite and Sunni scholars in that century and the centuries that followed wrote summaries or critiques of the book, including al-Shaykh al-Tusi's Talkhis al-shafi . Moreover, some people cited the book in their own theological books, as al-Sayyid al-Murtada himself cited it in other works of his, including Tanzih al-anbiya' , al-Muqni' fi l-ghayba , and al-Dhakhira , which were written after al-Shafi . According to Sayyid Ahmad Husayni, the editor of al-Dhakhira fi 'ilm al-kalam , al-Shafi indicates al-Sayyid al-Murtada's mastery of kalam (theology) and debates on all Islamic denominations. Sayyid Baha' al-Din al-Mukhtari al-Sabzawari, a scholar of the eleventh/seventeen and twelfth/eighteenth centuries, wrote a poem in Arabic about al-Shafi (literally: heal) to the following effect: Ignorance, illness of the mind / Cured by thought, physician kind. A book can heal with a soothing balm / No medicine matches al-Shafi's calm. Contents The book al-Shafi is structured into 22 sections as follows: Al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar's view of the necessity of imamate Textual evidence for the necessity of imamate Al-Qadi's rejection of the Shiite arguments for imamate and infallibility Al-Qadi's rational (philosophical) arguments against the necessity of there being an explicit text about the imam Repudiation of al-Qadi's critique of the Shiite arguments for the necessity of there being an explicit text about the imam Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of there being no text about the imam Repudiation of al-Qadi's view about the requisite characteristics of the imam Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of the imam's knowledge Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of the superiority of the imam Repudiation of al-Qadi's view about the hadith that the imams are from the Quraysh Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of whether it is permissible to turn away from the Quraysh with respect to imamate Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of the number of people who pledge their allegiance to the imam on behalf of the Islamic nation Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of Abu Bakr's imamate Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of those who believe that the election of imams is invalid Repudiation of al-Qadi's view that Abu Bakr was qualified for imamate Al-Qadi's reply to the objections against Abu Bakr Appraisal of al-Qadi's view of 'Umar b. al-Khattab 's imamate Al-Qadi's reply to objections against 'Umar Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of 'Uthman 's imamate Repudiation of al-Qadi's view of the critics of 'Uthman Appraisal of al-Qadi's view: proof for Imam 'Ali 's imamate Consideration of al-Qadi's skepticism about the repentance of Talha , al-Zubayr , and 'A'isha . Method Al-Sayyid al-Murtada replied to al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar's objections and repudiations in a selective way, as he notes in the introduction of the book. When he quotes al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar's book, al-Mughni , he only mentions the beginning part of each objection or a particular part of his words. These are cited as follows: “the author of the book said, ” “he said, ” “as for his statement, ” and “as for your statement”. Sometimes, hypothetical objections are made on behalf of al-Qadi, which are then answered. Summaries and Repudiations The following are summaries of al-Shafi written by Shiite scholars: Talkhis al-shafi by al-Shaykh al-Tusi , a student of al-Sayyid al-Murtada. [22] This book is said to be a reason why al-Shafi was protected against distortions. Irtishaf al-safi min silaf al-shafi by Sayyid Baha' al-Din al-Mukhtari (1080/1669-70 - 1131/1719). [23] Safwat al-safi min raghwat al-shafi by Sayyid Baha' al-Din al-Mukhtari. [24] Moreover, Abu l-Hasan al-Basri, a Sunni scholar, wrote Nqd al-shafi in repudiation of al-Shafi . Abu Ya'la al-Sallar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz , al-Sayyid al-Murtada's student, wrote the book al-Radd 'ala Abi l-Hasan al-Basri in reply to the repudiation. Publication Al-Shafi was lithographically printed in 1301/1883-4 along with al-Shaykh al-Tusi's summary. This version is mentioned by Aqa Buzurg Tihrani in al-Dhari'a . Moreover, in 1410/1989-90, al-Sadiq Publishing Institute published the book in four volumes. This was edited by Sayyid 'Abd al-Zahra' Khatib Husayni. The institute reprinted the book in 1384 Sh/2005 in two volumes. In his critical edition of al-Shafi , Sayyid 'Abd al-Zahra' Khatib Husayni consulted all the available manuscripts of the book in the Library of Ayatollah Mar'ashi Najafi and the Library of Astan Quds Razavi , showing their differences with abbreviations. Some features of this critical edition include citation of the sources of the passages quoted from al-Mughni (with volume and page numbers), giving the meanings of certain abstruse words, specification of the references of pronouns, and citation of the hadiths mentioned in the book from Shiite and Sunni sources. Moreover, he specified the passages quoted by al-Sayyid al-Murtada from al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar, but could not be found in al-Mughni . Manuscripts Sayyid 'Abd al-Zahra' Khatib Husayni, the editor of al-Shafi, lists the following as the available manuscripts of the book: The manuscript in the Library of Ayatollah Mar'ashi Najafi in 476 pages, each page containing 26 lines The manuscript in the Library of Astan Quds Razavi, no. 761 in books of philosophy and theology The manuscript in the Library of Astan Quds Razavi, no. 171, 270 pages, each page containing 22 lines, transcribed by Muhammad Ibrahim b.

{"title": "Afterlife Bodies", "text": "Afterlife bodies (Arabic: الأبدان الأُخرویة ) are sorts of bodies that were introduced by Mulla Sadra Shirazi in order to explain bodily resurrection . On the basis of some verses of the Qur'an , Muslims believe that our resurrection will be bodily, that is, humans will have bodies after the resurrection, but there are controversies with respect to the details of the bodily resurrection. Appealing to the apparent meaning of the verses, some Islamic theologians maintain that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same body that they had in this world, and they will undergo the events of the resurrection with this body. In contrast, some philosophers have denied the bodily resurrection; they have instead believed in spiritual resurrection . On the basis of his philosophical foundations in the Transcendental Theosophy , Mulla Sadra accepts bodily resurrection, but gives a new account of it. Views of the Theologians Many verses of the Qur'an are concerned with the resurrection, the Dooms Day , and people's return to God; for example, \"Say, He will revive them who produced them the first time, and He has knowledge of all creation.\" Qur'an 36 :79. \"Does man suppose that We will not put together his bones [at resurrection]? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to [re]shape [even] his fingertips!\" Qur'an 75 :3,4. \"Does he not know, when what is [buried] in the graves is turned over\" Qur'an 100 :9. \"And when the Trumpet is blown, behold, there they will be, scrambling towards their Lord from their graves!\" Qur'an 36:51 The apparent meaning of many verses regarding the resurrection is that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same bodies that they had during their life in this world. Most theologians believe that we cannot interpret these verses otherwise; so the bodies with which people will be resurrected are identical with the ones with which they lived in this world. This view is called bodily resurrection . In Shiite theology , the belief in the bodily resurrection is an obligation for any Muslim. But the belief in its specific details is not an obligation. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi says, \"It is an obligation to believe that God will revive all people in the resurrection and He will return people's souls to their original bodies. If anyone denies this or interprets it in such a way that leads to its apparent denial —as we hear some of our contemporary unbelievers— then, by the consensus of all Muslims, they will no longer be believers in Islam . For there are many verses of the Qur'an demonstrating that there will be a new life in the resurrection, and implying that its rejection leads to paganism . And one shall not pay attention to the doubts of philosophers [about bodily resurrection] who say that recreating the nonexistent (I'adat al-Ma'dum) is impossible. One shall not take seriously the interpretations of people who read bodily resurrection as spiritual resurrection . Views of Philosophers Muslim philosophers have tried to provide a rational account of the resurrection and its qualities. Though rational arguments are, in their view, evidence of the necessity of the resurrection and the existence of a world other than this world, the details of how the resurrection will occur—whether it is only spiritual, or both bodily and spiritual, and if it is bodily, whether the body involved is a material, elemental body or it is an imaginal, astral body—cannot be demonstrated by rational, philosophical arguments. This is why Ibn Sina (Avicenna) says: It must be known that part of the resurrection is approved by shari'a , and there is no way to demonstrate it except by shari'a and the testimony of the Prophet (s) —this is the part of it concerning the revival of the dead bodies. We must accept the quality of bodily resurrection and its details in accordance with religious evidence and revelation, since this is the most certain and the most complete criterion for man to acquire assuring truths. On the basis of their philosophical foundations, Peripatetic (masha') philosophers believed that after death, human bodies go out of existence, and since it is philosophically impossible for a nonexistent or annihilated object to come back into existence, human bodies cannot be revived, that is, they cannot re-exist. But the soul, because of its immateriality and spirituality, can never go out of existence, and so it survives the death of its associated body. Since these philosophers could not solve the philosophical problems of bodily resurrection —problems such as the re-existence of nonexistent objects— they have perforce tended to the spiritual resurrection or took it to be philosophically non-provable. Mulla Sadra's View After the Peripatetic philosophers, Mulla Sadra with his foundations of the Transcendental Wisdom , provided a different account of the bodily resurrection . He maintained that though the resurrection is in fact bodily and what is resurrected is the combination of one's body and the soul, the body resurrected in the Dooms Day is a delicate body which is exactly similar to (though not identical with) one's this-worldly body, but it has the disposition or potentiality for the afterlife . These changes in the position, magnitude and the shape of one's body do not threaten one's personal identity or persistence through time, since persons are individuated by their souls and not their bodies. This is why the person in the afterlife is judged to be the same person in this world, though his or her apparent features might have changed. So if the soul survives, the changes or transformations in the matter will not be important. Differences between Afterlife Bodies and This-Worldly Bodies Mulla Sadra enumerates the differences between afterlife bodies and this-worldly bodies as follows: Afterlife bodies cannot be corrupted, unlike this-worldly bodies. [6] Afterlife bodies have a spirit and life—in fact, they are identical with life, that is, their lives are essential, rather than accidental, to them, but some this-worldly bodies have life and some lack it. [7] Afterlife bodies are infinite as to the number of the conceptions and perceptions of their souls, since the arguments for the finitude of the dimensions do not apply to them. [8] Afterlife bodies are intermediate between the two worlds—they combine spirituality and corporeality, and they lack most features and properties of this-worldly bodies. [9] Afterlife bodies do not spatially prevent one another. [10] This-worldly bodies emerge gradually, but afterlife bodies emerge abruptly.

{"title": "Ihqaq al-haqq (book)", "text": "Ihqaq al-haqq wa ʾizhaq al-batil Author Qadi Nur Allah Shushtari Original title Language Arabic Subject Imamate of Imam Ali (a) Genre Theology Published 1409 /1988-9 Publisher Qom : Ayatollah Mar'ashi Najafi Library (Arabic: اِحقاق الحَق و اِزهاق الباطِل ) known as Ihqaq al-haqq is a book in theology written by Qadi Nur Allah Shushtari , one of the greatest Shi'a scholar who passed away in 1019/1610. He wrote this book for defending guardianship and imamate of Imam Ali (a) and explaining theological ideas of Shi'a and rejecting the book Ibtal nahj al-batil wa ihmal kashf al-'atil written by Fadl Allah Amin son of Ruzbihan b. Fadl Allah Khunji Shirazi Isfahani who was a great Shafi'i scholar. Fadl Allah Amin has many works, most famous of which is Ibtal nahj al-batil which is rejecting Nahj al-haqq written by al-'Allama al-Hilli who wrote his book for introducing Shi'a to Öljaitü , Muhammad Khodabandeh .. Qadi Nur Allah was martyred because of writing this book. There have been many researches including translation, commentary, etc. made on this work. About the Author Sayyid Nur Allah Husayni Mar'ashi was born in 956/1549-50 in Shushtar , Khuzestan province. His lineage reached Imam al-Sajjad (a) . His father, Sayyid Sharif al-Din was among great scholars of his time. Sayyid Sharif al-Din had many works in intellectual and traditional sciences. The Author's Goal After Al-'Allama al-Hilli , the author of Nahj al-haqq passed away, the Sunni Shafi'i Fadl b. Ruzbihan Isfahani wrote Ibtal l-batil wa ihmal kashf al-'atil to reject Al-'Allama al-Hilli's chapter on imamate . In opposition, the martyred Qadi Nur Allah Shushtari also criticized Ruzbehan's book in his Ihqaa al-haqq and defended Al-'Allama al-Hilli's ideas. In fact, Ihqaq al-haqq is a summary of the Shi'a -Sunni debates on theology , prophethood and imamate. The Cause of Naming Qadi Nur Allah Shushtari adopted the name of his book from Qur'an 17 :81, \"And say, 'The Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to vanish\"; for which, the name of the book mean \"Proving the Truth and vanishing the falsehood\" to call his readers to the Book of God and proving the Truth. The Author's Approach The author has taken the approach of debate and polemic techniques. After the sermon, Qadi Nur Allah has quoted the full text of Ibn Ruzbihan's sermon and then criticizes it. He then quotes some phrases of Al-'Allama al-Hilli 's Nahj al-haqq word by word. Then, he mentions Fadl b. Ruzbihan's criticism and then mentions his own analysis for the whole discussion from historical and logical perspectives. The Book's Content In this book, Qadi Nur Allah Shushtari meant to introduce Shi'a's major and minor principles and shows deviations of critics and therefore he has discussed major and minor principles of both Shi'a and Sunni comparatively and has mentions his points in 8 categories: Understanding Opinion and thought God 's attributes Prophethood Imamate Hereafter Usul al-fiqh Jurisprudential issues which are in contradiction with the Qur'an and the tradition from Sunni point of view. Scholars' Views about the Book Wahid al-Bihbahani wrote, \"Anyone who wants to strengthen his beliefs, should refer to the book Ihqaq al-haq , since this book will suffice him from other books.\" Muhaqqiq Qummi , author of al-Qawanin wrote, \"I believe that if Al-'Allama al-Hilli himself tried to reject Ibn Ruzbihan's claims, he would not be able to defend himself as the martyred Qadi did.\" Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi wrote, \"It is necessary that every Shi'a has a copy of this book and read it [regularly.]\" Researches Made about the Book Complementary Works Allama Shaykh Muhamamd Hasan Muzaffar 's Dala'il al-sidq li Nahj al-haqq was written as a complementary work for Ihqaq al-haqq which has frequently been published in Iran , Egypt and Iraq . Glosses Gloss written by Al-Shaykh Mufid al-Din 'Abd al-Nabi Shirazi Gloss written by Mawla Muhammad Hadi b. 'Abd al-Husayn Gloss written by an anonymous grandchildren of Qadi Nur Allah Shushtari . Commentaries and Supplements Supplements of Ihqaq al-haqq are 36 volumes including the content list of the supplements which were written and compiled by a group under supervision of Ayatullah Mar'ashi Najafi . He wrote an extensive introduction to them titled as al-La'ali al-muntazama wa al-durar al-thamaniyya . Volume 3 is about the complements on the verses revealed about Imam Ali (a) . Volumes 4 to 11 containing virtues of Imam Ali (a), Lady Fatima (s) and Imam al-Hasan (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) . Volume 12 which deals with biography and virtues of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) .

{"title": "Metamorphosis", "text": "Metamorphosis or Maskh (Arabic: مَسْخ ) is a kind of divine punishment in which one is transformed into an animal. In metamorphosis, the human identity is not lost, while its appearance changes into an animal figure. Some cases of metamorphosis are mentioned in Islamic sources, the best-known of which is the story of People of Sabbath . According to Qur'anic verses , People of Sabbath were people from the Children of Israel who defied God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays, and then, were transformed into monkeys. According to Islamic hadiths , metamorphosis occurs on the day of resurrection as well, when some sinners are transformed into animals such as monkeys and pigs. Some Quranic exegetes interpret the story as allegorical; that is, sins lead to animal temperaments. Such an interpretation is rejected by the majority of exegetes, however. They believe that appearances of the people in the story really changed. Definition of Metamorphosis and its Difference from Metempsychosis Metamorphosis is the transformation of something's appearances into something unpleasant. Metempsychosis is the attachment of the soul to another body after its separation from its own body. In metamorphosis, the soul is not separated from the body. Instead, the appearances of the body change and is transformed into an animal. Preservation of the Human Identity in Metamorphosis According to Muslim scholars, the transformation of human appearances does not amount to the change of his human nature. Thus, metamorphosis is not tantamount to the destruction of a human individual and creation of a monkey individual or the transmigration of a human soul into a monkey body. Instead, metamorphosis is the coincidence of two specific forms. That is to say, while the human specific form is still there, it has received a monkey specific form as well. Hence, the individual should be called a human monkey. Here is how Murteza Mutahhari explains the issue: \"in whatever way I am on the day of resurrection, whether I am with this body or with another body, I am one hundred percent the same person, although my appearances might have changed. Even if I undergo a metamorphosis on the day of resurrection in proportion to my psychological attitudes, and I am resurrected in an animal form, it is still me who has animal organs.\" Occurrence of Metamorphosis According to the Qur'an The Qur'an talks about the metamorphosis of some human beings. For example, the verse twenty of Qur'an 5 is about the transformation of some human beings into monkeys and pigs. Moreover, the verse sixty five of Qur'an 2 is about some people from among the Children of Israel , known as People of Sabbath , who were transformed into monkeys because they disobeyed God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays. Metamorphosis of some Disciples According to some Quranic verses, the disciples of Jesus asked God to send them a table of foods from the sky. When God sent them the table, He said: \"should any of you disbelieve after this, I will indeed punish him with a punishment such as I do not punish anyone in all creation.\" Some exegetes interpret the verse as follows: some disciples betrayed Jesus (a) despite the heavenly table, and then they were transformed into animals by God. Some other exegetes like 'Allama Tabataba'i have rejected this interpretation, taking it to be in conflict with other Quranic verses. How the Quranic Metamorphosis Occurred There are different accounts of how metamorphosis occurs in this world. The majority of Quranic exegetes believe that metamorphosis or maskh in the Qur'an is the transformation of the human body into another animal. Some others believe, nevertheless, that metamorphosis merely occurs in one's inner self, and human face or appearance does not change. Mujahid b. Jubayr (d. 102/720-1) says: \"the metamorphosis mentioned in the Qur'an is an analogy just like ‘the example of an ass carrying books’.\" 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashani said: the metamorphosis occurred merely in people's inner selves. In other words, the Jews who underwent metamorphosis were just like other people in their outer forms, although they were not humans in their inner selves. The same view is held by Rashid Rida and Muhammad Abduh . Notwithstanding this, the majority of Quranic exegetes believe that the metamorphosis in the Qur'an is used literally. That is, it really occurred in people's bodies and their appearances did change. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , there are mutawatir hadiths to the same effect. As to the objection that this kind of metamorphosis is improbable, advocates of the latter view argue that if we accept miracles by prophets , then the extraordinary character of an action cannot be evidence for its impossibility. Instead, this is a condition of miracles. Metamorphosis of Human Beings in Resurrection According to some hadiths, some people will be resurrected in animal forms. For example, Ma'adh b. Jabal asked the Prophet (s) about the Quranic verse, \"the day the Trumpet will be blown , and you will come in groups.\" The Prophet (s) said: some of them will be resurrected in the form of monkeys, some in the form of pigs, and so on.” According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) : \"those who deny the divine destination will be resurrected from their graves in the form of monkeys and pigs.\" Metamorphosis of the Soul Some Muslim scholars believe that human beings might undergo metamorphosis in their souls and thus they might spiritually turn into animals. Some Quranic exegetes maintain that the Quranic verse, \"they are just like cattle; indeed, they are more astray,\" is a reference to this fact. According to Murteza Mutahhari , a man's humanity depends on his moral characteristics, and if he gains the characteristics of a savage animal, then he has indeed undergone metamorphosis.\" Other Examples of Metamorphosis In some Shiite and Sunni sources, there are reports of metamorphosis of people other than those mentioned in the Qur'an. For example, there is a hadith cited in al-Khisal by al-Shaykh al-Saduq according to which thirteen animal species, including scorpions, bats, and bears, were original human beings who then underwent metamorphosis. Moreover, al-Tabarani, a Sunni scholar in third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, quoted the Prophet (s) as saying that some Muslims will undergo metamorphosis and turn into monkeys and pigs. The Fate of Metamorphosed People According to hadiths, people whose metamorphosis story is mentioned in the Qur'an survived just for three days, and they had no progenies. Sadr al-Muti'allihin says: \"Muslims have consensus over the fact that today's animals are not progenies of metamorphosed human beings, since these people died after three days without producing children during their animal period.\" See Also People of the Sabbath Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related"}
{"title": "Barzakh", "text": " Barzakh (Arabic: بَرزَخ ) is a world between this world and hereafter ; it is also called the imaginal world or the world of grave . Brazakh exists for both believers and non-believers, though it is similar to the Heaven for the former, and similar to the Hell for non-believers. Meaning 'Barzakh' in Arabic literally means an interval or a barrier between two things, and technically it means an interval between the end of this-worldly life (death) and the beginning of hereafter. The world is called 'Barzakh' because it is an interval between this world and the hereafter. The world is also called the world of grave and the imaginal world. In the Qur'an The word 'Barzakh' has been mentioned three times in the Qur'an . but only in Qur'an 23 :100 it has been used in the meaning in question: “ حَتَّى إِذَا جَاء أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ (۹۹) لَعَلِّی أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِیمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّا إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَائِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى یوْمِ یبْعَثُونَ \"When death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord! Take me back (99) that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.' 'By no means! These are mere words that he says.' And ahead of them is a Barzakh until the day they will be resurrected.\" ” — Qur'an, Qur'an 23:99-100 According to this verse of the Qur'an, the request of some people at the time of their death to return to the world in order to do the good deeds that they have not done is not in place, and they face a barrier or an interval—a Barzakh—until the Day of Judgment . The phrase \"until the day they will be resurrected\" indicates that Barzakh is an interval between this world and the hereafter, that anyone experiences after their death and before the Day of Judgment. Proof in the Qur'an In addition to verse 100 of Qur'an 23 that explicitly shows the existence of Barzakh, some verses prove Barzakh without mentioning the word 'Barzakh'. These verses concern the life of martyrs after their deaths: And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their lord. [5] And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive. [6] Moreover, according to Qur'anic verses, Barzakh is not restricted to martyrs—a sinner like Pharaoh and his friends also experience Barzakh: In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the day that judgment will be established: 'cast ye the people of pharaoh into the severest penalty! ( Qur'an 23 :46) [7] The verse obviously points to a penalty for Pharaoh and his people before the penalties of the Day of Judgment, and that is the penalty in Barzakh. In Hadiths Definition In some hadiths , the word 'Barzakh' is used to mean an interval between this world and the hereafter. For instance, according a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , all (true) Shiites will go to the Heaven in the hereafter, and, the hadith goes on, 'I swear to God that I fear about you in Barzakh'. A person asked him about Barzakh, and Imam answered: '[it is] the grave, from one's death to the Day of Judgment'. This latter statement implies that the world of grave is the world of Barzakh —indeed, grave in this hadith does not mean a certain hole in the earth; it is a metaphor for Barzakh. Barzakh's Heaven and Hell Some hadiths state that the world of Barzakh has its own heaven and hell in which people are rewarded or punished for their deeds. The Prophet (s) says: \"the grave is either a garden of heaven or a hole of hell\". Question of the Grave A number of hadiths show that once people enter the world of Barzakh, they are questioned about their beliefs and deeds. This questioning is known as \"the question of the grave\". Barzakhi Body Human soul attaches to an imaginal or Barzakhi body. An imaginal body is one that is not of a material kind, and yet enjoys some characteristics of material objects, such as shape and size. In these respects, the imaginal body is like a person's natural body. In order to have a clear picture of an imaginal or Barzakhi body, one might reflect on the forms or images that one observes while dreaming. Such forms are undoubtedly non-material; they do not occupy any space and they do not have any mass, and yet they have a shape and a size and they have forms like those of material objects.

{"title": "Bada'", "text": "Badāʾ' (Arabic: بَداء ) is a terminology in theology , meaning that God reveals to people something other than what they thought would happen. However, when bada' is used about people, it refers to their changing their decisions. There are several verses of the Qur'an concerning this notion and some of its instances. In some hadiths , belief in bada' has been said to be along with the real knowledge of monotheism (tawhid), without which God cannot be truly known. In Shiite resources of hadith, details of bada' have been talked about; for example, in al-Kafi there is a separate section about bada' including 16 hadiths. Literal and Terminological Meanings Bada' has two literal meanings: appearance or emergence, and occurrence of a thought or an opinion. When someone has made a decision to do something, but before doing it one comes to know that there is a harm or threat consequent upon that act, and so one changes one's mind; In such a case we say that a bada' has occurred, since the person did not know all the facts about the act in question; otherwise, one would not have decided to do it. It is obvious that the change of mind arises from ignorance of the facts. Therefore, it is legitimate to use the word \"bada'\" about human beings, but such a use is illegitimate with respect to God . Also, people might say that a bada' occurred for someone in this act to mean that the goodness of that act became obvious to one (though it was not obvious before). The word is also used in the case of omissions. The word \"bada'\" is used about God without implying any change of mind out of ignorance or weakness, and thus bada' as a Shiite belief means that God reveals for people facts that were hidden from them such that they expected otherwise. In the Qur'an In the Qur'an , there are several verses concerning the notion of bada' and its instances; for example, \"Allah makes to pass away and establishes what he pleases\" (Quran 13:39); in a commentary on this verse, Imam al-Sadiq (a) says: \"is not it the case that Allah makes to pass away what is established, and establishes what has passed away?\" In Hadiths In Shiite resources, there are many hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad (s) and Imams (a) that approve bada' and take belief in bada' to be a sort of worship for God and one of the highest forms of obeisance for God. Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"None of the prophets became prophets until they admitted five characteristics for God: bada', providence, prostration ( sujud ), divinity, and His obedience.\" In another hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), we read, \"No bada' occurs for God except that it is already in His knowledge.\" Moreover, the belief in bada' is greatly emphasized, so much so that it has been regarded as a sign of true faith in God. According to a hadith, \"God is not worshiped with any deed as He is worshiped with [the belief in] bada'.\" Imam al-Sadiq (a) is also reported to have said, \"If people knew what reward is reserved for the belief in bada', they would never get bored with discussing it.\" Challenging the Doctrine of Bada' The belief in bada' has been widely discussed and challenged in non-Shiite Muslim theological and exegetical works, which have accused the Shi'a of inventing it. Relation with the Divine Knowledge The main objection against the belief in bada' is that it entails change in God's knowledge. In response to that, some Imami scholars, have differentiated between two types of divine knowledge: Essential knowledge, which is eternal and no change occurs in it, and Aactual knowledge, which is identical with God's actions. The second type is created in time and is changeable, and bada' occurs only in this type. There is no bada' in God's essential knowledge; God even knows that bada' will take place. Bada' does not entail any change in God's essence—knowing about a change is different from the change itself. Imam al-Sadiq (a) says in this regard, \"No bada' occurs for God but it has already been in God's knowledge. Bada' does not occur for God out of ignorance.\" Relation with God's Eternal Will Some non-Shiite scholars regard the belief in bada' contrary to the belief in God's eternal will. In defense of their belief, Shiite scholars have explained that God's eternal will (qada') has three types: Necessary qada', known only to God. There is no bada' in this type, because it entails change in God's knowledge, which is impossible. Necessary qada', which God reveals to the angels, prophets, or imams, and they inform people of it. No bada' occurs in this type of qada' either, because it casts doubt upon the honesty of the prophets or the imams in the eyes of people. Contingent qada', in which God decrees something, but makes its occurrence contingent on His will. It is in this type of qada' that bada' takes place. Domain The necessary knowledge and decrees of God, referred to by such terms as the Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz ), the Reserved Knowledge (al-ilm al-makhzun), and the Mother Book (umm al-kitab), are unchangeable and fall outside the domain of bada'. God pre-eternally knows all things and the relationships between them, and nothing is outside His knowledge. What is inferred from the teachings of the Infallibles (a) is that, considering the verse \"Allah effaces and confirms whatever He wishes and with Him is the Mother Book\" (13:39), there are two books in relation to the affairs of the world: the book in which the decrees can change if God wills so (the Book of Effacing and Confirming \"mahw wa ithbat\", which contains, e.g., the changes in people's destinies as a result of their good or bad deeds), and the book in which the decrees are fixed and unchangeable (the \"Preserved Tablet\" or the \"Mother Book\"). In Sunni Sources Although some Sunni scholars have rejected the doctrine of bada' and criticized the Shi'a for it, the same doctrine, albeit not with the same name, has been affirmed in their sources. Al-Bukhari, for instance, reports, in his Sahih , on the authority of Abu Hurayra that the Prophet (s) said, \"There were three people among the Israelites who were afflicted with three diseases, vitiligo, deafness, and blindness. It occurred to God to test them…\" . Ibn Hajar comments on this hadith that \"The phrase ‘it occurred to God' means that God pre-eternally knew but then He revealed his knowledge, not that something was hidden from God and then He discovered it, because such a thing is impossible for God.\" In his commentary on Quran 39:42, Ibn Abi Hatam also quotes a hadith from Ibn Abbas , according to which, \"God makes people to die; if it occurred to God to take a soul, He would do so and the person dies; or He postpones the death until a specified time and returns the soul to its place\". Al-Haythami, too, quotes in his Majma' al-zawa'id in the section on \"The Sun's Rising from Where It Sets\" (Tulu' al-shams min maghribiha) a hadith related to bada'. Effects of the Belief Shiite scholars have mentioned several doctrinal and practical fruits for the belief in bada', including the establishment of the absolute power of God. Moreover, the doctrine of bada' provides an explanation for the difference between the Creator and the creation (including the prophets and imams), because bada' occurs only in the divine knowledge that is hidden from the others. Finally, the belief in bada' repudiates determinism and strengthens the spirit of endeavor, since the person who believes that his destiny can change strives to work toward making a better future for oneself. Such a person will have more hope in God and in the fulfillment of his prayers . Notes References Divine attributes Relation with human Related"}
{"title": "Amr Bayn al-Amrayn", "text": " Amr bayn al-amrayn (Arabic: أمر بين الأمرين ; meaning: a theory between the two theories) is Imamiyya 's belief concerning Human predestination and free will. This theory rejects both determinism and delegation of actions to mankind and shows that both God's will and human will are involved in human's voluntary actions in such a way that they are in line with each other. Based on some hadiths , the theory was first proposed by Imam 'Ali (a) . Background The problem of predestination (jabr) and delegation of actions to mankind (tafwid) has been a general issue that has concerned all different religions and sects. In addition to its theoretical aspect, the problem has a practical aspect and is related with issues such as Divine Justice and social freedom. The theory was first proposed by Amir al-Mu'minin (a) . Someone asked him about the nature of Qadar (fate). Imam recommended him not to enter such a complex and profound issue, but he insisted on his request. Imam said: now that you do not give up your request, know that regarding destiny, there is no predestination, nor delegation to mankind, rather something between these two (Amr Bayn al-Amrayn). There are many hadiths in this regard from other Imams , in particular Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) . Also a lengthy treatise has been quoted from Imam al-Hadi (a) about this problem. Explanation Amrayn (Arabic: أمرَين , literally: the two things) refers to predestination and delegation of actions to mankind. According to the theory of predestination, human will is by no means involved in any action, and according to the theory of delegation, human will is by all means effective, and God 's will or power has no role in human's actions; God has only created human beings and their powers. The theory of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn (a theory between the two theories) rejects both these theories and shows that both God's will and human will are involved in human's voluntary actions; these two wills are in line with each other, and this is the truth about human's free will in actions. Proponents Islamic philosophers and Imamiyya theologians (Mutakallimin) have been proponents of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn. Among other theological schools, although Maturidiyya have proposed the theory of acquisition (Kasb) about human voluntary actions, they have provided an interpretation of 'acquisition' which is compatible with Imamiyya attitude about Amr Bayn al-Amrayn. The view of Tahawiyya —followers of Abu Ja'far al-Misri al-Tahawi (229/843-4 ; 321/933)— with respect to this problem is also compatible with Imamiyya. Some Ash'ari theologians have subscribed to the theory of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn but not under this title —theologians such as Shams al-Din Mahmud al-Isfahani, 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Sha'rani, 'Abd al-'Azim al-Zarqani, al-Shaykh Muhammad 'Abduh and Shaykh Mahmud Shaltut . Arguments According to theologians, Qur'anic verses and hadiths and some rational proofs demonstrate the truth of this theory. Qur'anic Verses From among Qur'anic verses we can mention the verse \"You [alone] do we worship, and to You [alone] do we turn for help\" . The verse is incompatible with belief in predestination, since if God were the creator of our actions and our will were not involved in our actions, it would make no sense to ascribe worship to ourselves and say: \"we worship\", and on the other hand, the verse is incompatible with delegation of actions to mankind, since it does not make sense to seek aid from someone who is by no means involved in the realization of the action. In answer to a question about this problem, Imam al-Sadiq (a) appealed to this verse. Another verse to this effect is verse 17 of Anfal : So you did not slay them, but it was Allah who slew them, and you did not smite when you smote, but it was Allah who smote. This verse has first affirmed the verbs \"slay\" and \"smite\" to the faithful (Mu'minun) and the Prophet (s) by \"you slay them\" and \"you smote\" and then it denied the verbs about them and ascribed them to God. The affirmation and denial are not in the same respect; otherwise, it would be contradictory. The verse has instead denied the independence of the faithful and the prophet in their actions, but has affirmed their involvement in the actions. This is what has been called \"Amr Bayn al-Amrayn\". Some verses have described human beings free in their actions and have ascribed the actions to them, such as \"man shall have nothing but what he strives for\" and in some other verses, God's permission and providence have been said to be involved in actions, such as \"and we did not send any messenger but that he should be obeyed by allah's permission\" . The former verses are contrary to the theory of predestination and the latter are contrary to the theory of delegation of actions to mankind, and the way to reconcile the two is by saying that God has given volition and free will to his servants, and this volition is along God's own volition. Hadiths In different books of hadiths, there are hadiths with regard to this issue under sections titled \"the section on predestination and fate and something between the two things\" and \"the section on providence and volition\" and \"the section on ability\" that might be grouped in five categories: Hadiths that take predestination (Jabr) to be incompatible with obligation (Taklif), promise and threat (Wa'd wa Wa'id), reward and punishment (Thawab wa 'Iqab) and thus with God's wisdom. [27] Hadiths that take predestination and fate (Qadar) to be incompatible with the generality of God's power and thus take the theory of predestination to be incompatible with monism in creation and design. [28] Hadiths that introduce the right opinion to be somewhere between predestination and delegation of actions to mankind. [29] Hadiths that take the the nature of \"Amr Bayn al-Amrayn\" to be difficult to comprehend and to depend on being steadfast. According to these hadiths, it is sufficient for the faithful ( Mu'min ) to reject predestination and delegation of actions to mankind. [30] Hadiths that have illustrated the nature of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn in terms of examples in order to guide the laymen. [31] Explaining some Hadiths Imam al-Sadiq (a) assimilates the issue of human free will to a wrong-doing person that you prohibit him from the wrong action, but he does not listen to you. Imam said: since the wrong-doer did not comply with your prohibition and you let him do whatever he wants to do does not mean that you have ordered him to do the wrong action. Commenting on this hadith, Mulla Sadra writes: in that you prohibited him, you did not let him do whatever he does, and in that you let him do the wrong action, you have not forced him to do the action. Imam al-Rida (a) says: \"God Almighty says: O' son of Adam! You do what you want with my providence and you perform my orders with my power and you have power to sin with my blessings. I have made you see and listen. What happens to you by doing the right action is from God, and what happens to you by doing the wrong action is from you, and this is because I deserve the right action more than you, and you deserve the wrong action more than me, and this is because I am not questioned for what I do, but people are questioned for what they do.\" According to this hadith, volition and power are necessary components of human actions and both are granted to human beings by God. On the other hand, God has ordered humans to do right actions and has prohibited them from wrong actions. So it is true that right actions should be ascribed to God and wrong actions should be ascribed to His servants. Rational Arguments Theologians' Argument One of the arguments provided by theologians is that there are only three views conceivable about the problem of the relation between human volition and divine volition, since when we consider the two wills (God's will and the human's will) with respect to a certain action, it might be that only one of these is involved in the action or both. If we say that only one will is involved in the action and that is God's will, predestination would follow, and if we say that only human's will is involved, we would come to the delegation of the action to the man, but if we say that both are involved, Amr Bayn al-Amrayn would follow. It must be noted that we cannot hold that neither of the two wills are involved, since this is against our supposition. Philosophers' Argument Here is philosophers' (Hukama's) argument: God has the ability to do everything, but things are different with respect to the reception of existence (coming to being); God created some things immediately, and some things with a mediator. The mediator is sometimes one and is sometimes numerous, but the requirement of a mediator does not mean that God needs it in His actions; the mediator is required because of a deficiency in the receiver (the creature), since God is the cause of all causes and does not need anything in bringing objects to existence. Human's voluntary actions do not issue from God without any mediation because of their deficiencies and human's volition is one such mediator. Therefore, predestination is rejected and since all mediators are God's creatures and arise from his volition, the delegation of actions to mankind is also rejected. Functions of the Theory Responsibility One function of the theory of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn is that human sees himself/herself obligated to perform certain acts, and accepts responsibility for his/her actions, since on this view, human has free will in his/her actions, but the theory of predestination implies that human has no obligation and responsibility, which leads in turn to promiscuity and sloth. People who propose such a theory are often those who want to free themselves from any obligations, laws and morality and to justify wrong actions. For example, Umayyads often appealed to predestination and Murji'a to justify their cruelties. Morality Another function of the theory of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn is that the person would believe that s/he has free will and s/he can make changes to his/her nature. Therefore, s/he tries to produce good moral habits in him/herself. Contrary to this view, some people maintain that human nature is unchangeable. Relief from the Problems of the Theories of Predestination and Delegation The theories of predestination and delegation have problems of their own—ones that might be bypassed by the theory of Amr Bayn al-Amrayn. Two troubles with the theory of predestination: Moral and religious responsibilities of human beings do not make sense, Creation of bad things and sins by God. The trouble with the theory of delegation: God's power would be limited, and the theory of monotheism in actions would be undermined. Notes References Zarqānī, , vol. 1, p. 506."}
{"title": "Building over graves", "text": "Building over graves (Arabic: البناء على القبور ) means building any construction or structure over graves. There is a disagreement among Shia and Sunnis with Wahhabis about the Islamic ruling for building over graves. Islamic schools, especially Shia, have built constructions over the graves of great people and Islamic leaders and some Islamic scholars. This – with a conceptual expansion Wahhabis make – has a history and dates back to early Islam . According to historical shreds of evidence, it was not encountered with any objection from the Prophet (s) or the Followers . Wahhabis believe that building over the graves makes the grounds for worshiping them and polytheism in worshiping. Meaning of Building over Graves Building over graves, due to the many discussions related to it in fiqh , kalam and history, has become a term. It refers to any construction over graves, including qubba (dome), buq'a (mausoleum), darih , mosque , and even according to some, putting stones around the grave. It also includes constructions built prior to burial . Therefore, contrary to the meaning usually coming to the mind, it also includes leaving constructions built before burial. The Topic of Discussion and Dispute According to disputes made between Wahhabis and other Muslims, the discussion about building over graves refers to the religious ruling about constructing new buildings over graves and also Muslims' obligation regarding leaving built constructions over graves and its ruling. Historical Background Before Islam The grave of Prophet David (a) in Jerusalem and the graves of Prophets Abraham (a) , Isaac (a) , Jacob (a) and Joseph (a) in al-Khalil had tall buildings. At the time of the war led by Umar , Muslims did not destroy these graves and buildings. It shows that building over graves was neither reprehensible before Islam nor was it wrong in the views of Muslims in the early centuries of Islam. At the Time of the Prophet (s) The Holy Prophet (s) buried Fatima bt. Asad in a part of the mosque where was known as the grave of Lady Fatima (a) in Islamic history. Contemporary with Hudaybiyya peace treaty , the first construction or mosque was built over the grave of Abu Basir by Abu Jandal, and the Prophet (s) did not stop it while he (s) knew about it. At the Time of the Companions After the Prophet (s) passed away, he (s) was buried in his house, and preserving and repairing this house was made by Muslims and caliphs since the first years after his demise. First, 'Umar b. al-Khattab built a wall beside the grave of the Prophet (s) and separated it from the living place of Aisha . To expand the Prophet's (s) burial place, Walid b. 'Abd al-Malik (r. 86/705 – 96/715) destroyed the Prophet's (s) house, and in reconstruction, he appended the area surrounding the house to it and finally decorated the grave's chamber with alabaster. During the time of Mutawakkil (r. 228/847 – 242/861) and Musta'sim (ruling 640/1242 – 656/1258), this chamber was reconstructed. In 656/1258, the shrine of the Prophet (s) was decorated using the material the ruler of Egypt , Malik Mansur Ibak Salihi had sent, and the first dome called Qubba al-Zarqa was built over the chamber of the Prophet (s). In 765/1363-4, 852/1448-9, 881/1476-7, 886/1481-2, and 891/1486-7, it was reconstructed by Abbasid and Ottoman caliphs and domes were built over it. The lack of any objections to these reconstructions and expansions of the shrine by Muslims shows the legitimacy of this action and following the conduct of the Prophet (s) by Muslims and the permission for building over graves. Building over graves was a common action in the views of the Companions. When Al-Mughira b. Shu'ba expanded his house, the grave of Safiyya bt. Abd al-Muttalib , mother of Al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam , the aunt of the Prophet (s) was located inside the house, so a new structure was built over it. In the house of 'Aqil which gradually turned to become the dedicated place for the graves of Banu Hashim in Baqi' cemetery , the graves of Imams (a) and some companions had shrines. Ibn Athir reported sending an architect by Majd al-Mulk Qummi to repair the shrine and graves of four of Imams (a) and 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib. Ibn Jubayr, Ibn Najjar, Khalid b. 'Isa, Ibn Batuta and Awliya Chalapi in different times reported about the existence of some shrines over the graves of Imams (a). During the Time of the Followers The graves of Umm Salama and Umm Habiba , the Prophet's (s) wives, had a building over them. The graves of 'Aqil, his nephew, 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far b. Abi Talib , Ibrahim and some other children of the Prophet (s) had mausoleum and dome. Based on the report of Ibn Jubayr, the grave of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , Imam al-Hasan (a) and Ibrahim, son of the Prophet (s) were higher than the ground level. There are pieces of evidence that show that before 94/712, there was a building over the grave of Ibn 'Abbas . Second/Eighth Century The tradition of building over graves grew more in Islamic lands. The building over the grave of Ja'far, son of al-Mansur al-Abbasi (r. 136/754 – 158/775) shows the existence of building and dome over some graves in the 2nd/8th century; the building Harun al-Rashid (r. 170/786 – 193/809) built over the grave of Imam Ali (a) and the building over the grave of Sayyida Nafisa , a descendant of Imam al-Hasan (a) in Cairo are among the examples of this growth. Ibn Batuta reported about the existence of a mausoleum and mosque over the grave of Talha . Also, a mosque existed near the grave of Zubayr . Other examples of building over graves are the building and mausoleum over the grave of Salman Farsi in Mada'in and over the grave of Uways al-Qarani in Syria, a mosque over the grave of Sa'd b. 'Ubada , chief of Khazraj tribe, and also dome and mausoleum over the graves of Mu'adh b. Jabal , 'Aqaba b. 'Amir, Muhammad b. Abi Bakr and his sister Asma', Ibn Zubayr and Abu l-Hasan Dinawari, among the great Egyptian scholars in fiqh, Anas b. Malik , servant of the Prophet (s) and Sahl b. 'Abd Allah al-Tustari. After Third/Ninth Century In the first centuries after Islam, many cases of building constructions over graves and building mausoleums were seen. It happened in many consecutive centuries before the eyes of Muslims while none of the scholars, Shia or Sunni objected to these constructions, and no one believed that it is an act of polytheism or would deviate Muslims toward polytheism and idol-worshiping and worshiping other than God. Graves of Sunni leaders had dome and building too. The grave of Abu Hanifa (d. 150/767-8), leader of Hanafi school of fiqh in Baghdad had a dome and mausoleum which were built in the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries. Also, the grave of Malik b. Anas (d. 179/795), the leader of Maliki school , in Baqi' cemetery had a small dome. The grave of Muhammad b. Idris (d. 150/767), leader of Shafi'i school in Egypt and also the grave of Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 241/855), leaders of Hanbalis in Baghdad have had domes and have been reconstructed several times. The third/nineth century was when building domes over graves grew and since the fourth/tenth century, visiting them became common. An example of such graves is the grave of Muhammad b. 'Isa al-Tirmidhi (d. 296/892), which possibly belongs to the end of the third/ninth century and early 4th/10th century. In Aswan region in Nuba, which was one of the battlefields of Muslims with enemies, there are mausoleums from the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries over the graves of the martyrs of those wars. Since the sixth/twelfth century, many tombs were built around the Islamic world. In that century, when Sufism grew among Muslims, building Sufi tombs grew up; such as the tomb of Shaykh Ahmad Jam in Turbat Jam possibly built in sixth/twelfth century and the tomb of Bayazid Bastami built in eighth/fourteenh century. According to historical sources, Muslims have preserved and visited these buildings. Thus, the destruction of some buildings by caliphs, such as the destruction of the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) in 236/850-1 by Mutawakkil made Muslims upset and repulsive toward his action. Building over the Graves of Imams (a) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) The tradition of building mausoleums and shrines over the graves of Imams (a) is another historical evidence Muslims considered by Muslims. The grave of Imam Ali (a) has had a glamorous dome and building, and according to historical reports, its dome and building were built by Harun al-Rashid in second/eighth century and it was among old buildings over graves. Muhammad b. Yazid , a Shia ruler of Tabaristan , reconstructed this dome in 287/900-1. In an ode, Ibn Hajjaj Baghdadi, a poet of the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, mentioned the grave and dome of Imam Ali's (a) shrine . The first building over the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) was built when Mukhtar al-Thaqafi came to power. Later in 371/981-2, a darih made of teak was placed over the grave by order of 'Adud al-Dawla. Khatib Baghdadi mentioned the grave of Imam al-Kazim (a) among the graves of Quraysh which was visited and made entreaty to by Shias and some Sunni scholars. The shrine of Imam al-Rida (a) in Mashhad is such a building. Muhammad b. Mumal, a Hanafi scholar reported about the existence of Imam al-Rida's (a) mausoleum and shrine in Tus and also reported about visiting it by Sunni scholars. Ibn Habban introduced it a refuge for the helpless. In 333/944-5, Nasir al-Dawla Hamdani built a mausoleum over the graves of Imam al-Hadi (a) and Imam al-'Askari (a) in Samarra . Until the half of the second/eighth century, there was a shade over the grave of Lady Ma'suma (a) in Qom . In the second half of the third/ninth century, a mausoleum was built over it by Muhammad b. Zayd, da'i (caller) of Alawis (descendants of Imam Ali (a)). The brick entrance of the major gate to the shrine of 'Abd al-'Azim was made by Majd al-Din Barawistani, minister of Bakiyaraq Saljuki, in the fifth/eleventh century. The graves of Imams (a) in Baqi' cemetery, the grave of Banu Hashim and building dome over their graves, and also the grave of 'Abbas b. Abd al-Malik were constructed by order of Majd al-Mulk Barawistani in fifth/eleventh century and were reconstructed several times by caliphs. According to inscriptions available in these shrines, the first reconstruction was made by the Abbasid caliph Mustarshid Billah in 519/1125-6, and later in the early seventh/thirteenth century, Mustansir Billah made other repairs in the shrine. Islamic Ruling of Building over Graves In the two last centuries, Wahhabis issued a ruling for the destruction of constructions built over graves. The history of this ruling dates back to the seventh/thirteenth century and based on the theories of Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) and his pupil Ibn Qayyim (d. 751/1350) according to whom, destruction of these constructions and shrines is obligatory. Their first action was the destruction of the shrine and grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) in 1216/1801 and then, they destroyed the shrines of Imams (a) in Baqi' in 1221/1806. After reconstruction of destructed shrines, when Wahhabis took control of Hijaz in 1344/1926, they collected rulings of scholars in Medina on the issue and began destroying the mausoleums of the Companions and Infallible Imams (a) in Baqi'. This way, the issue of building over the graves turned into one of the controversial issues in the Islamic world. However, contrary to the beliefs of this group, other Muslims considered it permissible to build over graves, any construction including a mausoleum, mosque, or school. Shia and some Sunnis consider it in accordance with Muslims' tradition. Some Sunni faqihs, only in some cases, have considered it reprehensible, and some others consider construction over the graves of the Prophets (s), martyrs, and the righteous recommended. Some Sunni researchers believe that the disagreement made about the issue of construction around graves is because of Wahhabis' carelessness about hadiths prohibiting construction and their lack of attention toward justifications against them. Prohibitions in these hadiths are not general, and they are about special cases and are based on some reasons such as touching the materials of construction with fire, their heaviness on the buried body, or their separation from the graves of other Muslims and preventing the burial of other Muslims near them. According to principles of usul, a ruling which has its justification with it is specific to a certain case; the justification is given for and cannot be generalized for other cases. Moreover, contrary reasons are permitting the construction, which are even stronger in reference and chain of transmission than proscriptive narrations. Even proscriptive narrations regard this action as reprehensible. However, the graves of religious personalities, the righteous, and martyrs are out of this reprehension because they are considered among religious sacraments, and building mosques and mausoleum over their graves is honoring them because their graves are distinguished and people visit them. According to the glorious Qur'an , upholding religious symbols is a sign of spiritual health and sincerity in intention. The View of the Qur'an In the dispute between Muslims and polytheists over the bodies of the People of the Cave, the glorious Qur'an mentions the opinions of both parties. Some suggested building a mausoleum or wall in front of the cave, \"they said, 'Build a building over them.\" (18:21) so that they would be hidden from people's sight. Some others suggested building mosque or temple over their graves, \"'We will set up a place of worship over them.'\" (18:21) Finally, they decided to build a mosque over their graves so that people worship God there, and also the work of the People of the Cave would be kept and be blessed by their graves. In these verses, there is no mention of the polytheistic nature of this action, for if building construction or mosque was polytheistic, it must have been mentioned.

{"title": "Caliphate", "text": "Khilāfa (Arabic: خِلافَة , caliphate) is a political-religious term which refers to the succession of the Prophet (s) in political, governmental and religious matters. According to Shiites , the succession of the Prophet (s) extends to both mundane and afterlife matters, and the Prophet's (s) caliphs are Twelve Imams (a) from Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the only difference between them and the Prophet (s) being that God does not make any revelation to them. After the demise of the Prophet (s), the official caliph [except for the short term rule of Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Hasan (a) ] was undertaken by non-infallibles (people who were not ma'sum ). For about 13 centuries, numerous persons and dynasties occupied this position, introducing themselves as successors, that is, caliphs of the Prophet (s). In historical terms, caliphate is a structure of government in terms of which the administration of the Islamic community took shape after the demise of the Prophet (s), and its occupant, who is called 'Khalifa' or 'caliph', counts as the Prophet's (s) successor in the Islamic government. Meaning The Arabic word \"Khilafa\" is originated in the root of \"kh-l-f\" (Arabic: خ‌ ل‌ ف ) which denotes succession, and the word \"Khalifa\" ( خَلیفَة , plural: Khulafa' خُلَفاء and Khala'if خَلائِف ) means successor or surrogate. The words \"Khalifa\", \"Khulafa\" and \"Khala'if\" have been used in the Qur'an in just this literal meaning. In the wake of the demise of the Prophet (s) followed by political developments, the words \"Khilafa\" and \"Khalifa\" were used to refer to the political succession of the Prophet (s) in governing the Islamic community, or any Islamic government after the demise of the Prophet (s). Such uses have turned these words into key notions of the political culture of Muslims, and some people tried to ground the legitimacy of the political system of Khilafa or caliphate in the use of the word \"Khalifa\" in the Qur'an. The words imamate and Imam have also been used in the work of early Muslim authors in the same meaning, which is different from what Shi'as mean by the words. History In the historical approach, caliphate is a structure of government in terms of which the administration of the Islamic community after the demise of the Prophet (s) took shape, and its occupant, the Khalifa or caliph, counts as the Prophet's (s) successor in the Islamic government. Event of Saqifa Bani Sa'ida The formation of caliphate dates back to an assembly in Saqifa Bani Sa'ida in which a group of companions sought to determine the Prophet's (s) successor immediately after his demise. The architects of caliphate as a political system seem to have had a remarkable grasp of the system, which is the origin of the most important ideas about caliphate that left a profound impact on the subsequent views of Muslims. The assembly in Saqifa displayed the strong influence of the pre-Islamic cultural and social traditions of Arabs on the formation of the structure of an Islamic government. Conditions of Caliph The founders of the caliphate emphasized that the caliph should be from Quraysh , thereby making the tribal approach the most significant basis of the caliphate. Given its consistency with the cultural and social life of Arab people, the approach received wide acceptance. It was in line with such an approach that Al-Abbas b. Abd al-Muttalib , the Prophet's (s) uncle, emphasized the family inheritance of caliphate, and Abu Sufyan opposed the rule of a low-ranking kinsman of Quraysh, that is Taym , the tribe of Abu Bakr . In spite of this, there were still people at that time who did not subscribe to such a notion of the Prophet's (s) succession. Opponents Given their crucial contribution to the progress of Islam , Ansar (the helpers)) wanted a ruler from themselves with the same position as the ruler from Quraysh. Ahl al-Bayt , some people of Banu Hashim , as well as some of companions , opposed the assembly in Saqifa. They did not recognize the notion of the caliphate as assumed by parties in the Saqifa meeting. Instead, they refused to accept what was later known as the religious and mundane authority of the caliph as the successor of the Prophet (s), taking it to be a privileged feature of an Imam who is appointed by God and the Prophet (s). Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa The system of the caliphate was established by choosing Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa as the first successor of the Prophet (s), though the choice was later known as \"Falta\" (Arabic: فَلتة , lit. a sudden, snap and unexpected event) by 'Umar b. Khattab . Since the decision was opposed by many of Companions, Banu Hashim and in particular, Ahl al-Bayt (a) , it was difficult to make people pledge allegiance for the caliph. Since the legitimacy of the new government did not seem obtainable except through people pledging their allegiance to the \"caliph\", proponents of the new government tried to get people to pledge their allegiance in whatever ways they could. While oppositions to the First Caliph were so frequent that he once decided to resign from power, the most important opponents were quenched in different ways in order to keep the First Caliph in power. He was called 'Khalifat Rasul Allah' (the successor of the Prophet (s)). Abu Bakr is the first of Rashidun Caliphs , and the procedure for his election as a caliph is the ground of the theory of ahl al-hall wa l-'aqd (people of solution and convention) in the political jurisprudence of Sunni Muslims. Abu Bakr's practice during his two years of caliphate unveils his broad conception of the caliphate as the successor of the Prophet (s) in religious and mundane matters. Performance All the authorities and powers of the Prophet (s) were conferred to the caliph, the only difference being the sources of their powers. Such a conception of the caliphate was exhibited most obviously when Abu Bakr declared that Muslims who refuse to pay their zakat to him are apostates (Murtadd). He was so strict in his reaction to these people that other Muslims objected to him. In fact, unlike the early statements of Abu Bakr as taking himself to be equal with other Muslims, asking people to enjoin the right (Amr bi l-ma'ruf) on him and forbid him from the wrong (Nahy 'an al-munkar) and obey him only insofar as he is on the right path of God, his performance during his caliphate displayed an authoritarian character, not only extending to the broad area of the caliph's authorities, but also to his preferences for the Quraysh tribe to which he belonged. He explicitly declared his preference for Quraysh and even in practice, he did not punish some criminals who were from this tribe, such as Khalid b. Walid . Umar b. al-Khattab A short time before his death ( 13 /634), Abu Bakr appointed 'Umar b. al-Khattab as his successor and obligated Muslims to pledge their allegiances to him. He has been reported as having said that the reason for such an appointment was to prevent riots ( fitna ) in the Islamic community. It is not clearly known what he meant by 'riot', but insofar as the structure of caliphate is concerned, this reveals the lack of any unified approach to the selection or election of the caliph—the selection being subject to personal interests and preferences—which opened the way for the inheritability of the caliphate, turning it into the sultanate. Since Abu Bakr was called the Prophet 's (s) successor, and 'Umar b. al-Khattab was Abu Bakr's successor, he was called \"Khalifat Khalifat Rasul Allah\" (Arabic: خليفة خليفة رسول الله , the successor of the successor of the Prophet (s)), but he preferred to be called \" Amir al-Mu'minin \" (the ruler of the believers), instead. The title, Amir al-Mu'minin, remained the most popular and the most significant title for caliphs until the end of the age of caliphate. At the time of the second caliph, widespread changes were made in different dimensions of the emerging Islamic community, exhibiting an extension in the notion of caliphate, especially in its religious aspects. This view is supported by changes made by the caliph in some traditions of the Prophet (s) or some Islamic laws. Performance As a caliph, 'Umar took his authorities and power to be equal to those of the Prophet (s). Such a view was sometimes given a religious profile. While such a view came to be accepted among Arab Muslims, it gave rise to some worries even among the agents of the government. Even Umar himself was concerned that caliph would turn into a king or a sultan, despite his inflexible thoughts regarding the wide authorities of the caliph. Such worries were reinforced by his taking the election of Abu Bakr to have been sudden, that Abu Bakr took power without Muslims being consulted, and his different practice in selecting his own successor. However, such worries remained just that, since some of his governmental policies, such as his attempts to approximate the structure of caliphate to that of standard governments of that time, left serious impacts in the Islamic community; policies such as the constant propagation of the view that Arabs are superior to other ethnic groups ('Ajam) in contrary to the Prophet's (s) explicit anti-racist views, discrimination among people in their shares of the governmental treasury (Arabic: بیت المال , Bayt al-Mal , or the finance house), and the abolition of an equal sharing of war booties. Appointing the Council of Caliphate Umar left the election of his successor to a six-member council constituted by the Prophet's (s) companions . It seems that this was not his initial opinion since according to some reports, he frequently expressed his preference to appoint some of companions, who were not alive at that time, as his successors. These remarks, together with his views about the subsequent caliph, express his doubts in this regard. But he finally found it more practical to leave the decision to a council. The council was not independent enough in its election, since all its six members were from Quraysh and since they were required to elect the caliph from among themselves, the tribal approaches to the election of the caliph (emphasizing the superiority of Quraysh) would persist. Though the council resolved the problem of finding a successor for the Second Caliph, it turned into a new problem—because of raising new claims concerning caliphate—that deepened the disputes among Muslims. 'Uthman b. 'Affan 'Uthman b. 'Affan took power in 23 /643-4 or 24 /644-5. He was given the pledge for allegiance (Bay'a) on the condition that he acts upon the Qur'an and the Prophet's (s) tradition, and most importantly, follow the practice of the previous caliphs (called ' Shaykhayn ', the two old men). Imam 'Ali (a) refused to accept the latter condition, and 'Uthman himself did not remain committed to it. In fact, though his conception of the position of caliphate and its authorities was similar to that of his predecessors, his governmental policies were unexpectedly radical and deconstructive. Performance Some actions, such as appointing some people who were banished from the Islamic community by the Prophet (s) to important governmental positions, assigning important governmental affairs to Banu Umayya , and donations to some people, especially people of Banu Umayya, from the Islamic treasury, were in direct contradiction with the dominant conception of caliphate among Muslims. Though these took place in the last years of Uthman's caliphate, it was heralded by some of his approaches in the first days of his rule. It has been reported that, after 'Uthman received people's Bay'a, Abu Sufyan called him to return to pre-Islamic criteria, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf called him the supporter of Banu Umayya. Formation of Formal Ceremonies Some of 'Uthman's early practices were evidence of his different approach. It is reported that on the first night of his caliphate, when he went to the mosque to say prayers , some people with candles in their hands walked ahead, which was a sort of formal ceremony. And unlike the previous two caliphs who always sat below the Prophet's (s) seat on the minbar , he sat on the Prophet's (s) seat. According to al-Ya'qubi , he later called the custodian of the treasury his own custodian, which shows his tendency to treat the treasury as his own personal property. And this is what underwrites his donations to people from the treasury. And when his opponents asked him to resign from power, he rejected their request on the basis of the argument that God has given him the position. Such a conception was reinforced by 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar by saying to 'Uthman that \"[caliphate is] a cloth that God has put on you\". The fact that such conceptions of caliphate gave rise to serious objections and oppositions among Muslims, and in particular among the Prophet's (s) companions, is evidence that they were at odds with the concept of caliphate most Muslims had in mind then. Other characteristics The most important actions of 'Uthman that gave rise to objections include: not observing the rights, changing the laws of the Qur'an , increasing his personal wealth by the support of the public treasury, overlooking people's criticisms and their enjoining him the good (al-Amr bi l-ma'ruf) and forbidding him the wrong (al-Nahy 'an al-munkar), tendency to pre-Islamic traditions such as tribalism, instead of Islamic values, e.g. giving more power to Banu Umayya and in particular Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan , and overlooking the unjust behaviors of his agents with people. Murder of the Third Caliph When the Third Caliph overlooked frequent objections of people, Muslims asked for his resignation and punishment. Though the request was unprecedented, it shows that caliphate was, for people at that time, a position that may be subject to criticisms, and it is, on this conception, legitimate insofar as it is in accordance with the Islamic values, and it can persist only if people consent to it. Therefore, on this conception, if a caliph were not practically committed to religious laws, people had the right to object to him, remove him from power, and even rise against him. The Third Caliph was killed after a public riot. The event revealed a deep division among Muslims. There were two influential tendencies among Muslims: idealists who could not overlook any deviations in the caliphate from Islam, and some wealthy people who were only concerned with their mundane interests. At this point in history, social circumstances led to the victory of idealists and the election of Imam 'Ali (a) as the next caliph. Ali b. Abi Talib (a) Election People pledged their allegiance with 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) when, unlike the previous three caliphs, there was no particular procedure for his election and 'Uthman had not proposed any such procedures for the election of his successor. This was the result of the particular social and political circumstances of Muslims at that time. In these circumstances, the Third Caliph did not have the time and chance for proposing procedures for the election of the next caliph, nor was it feasible for Muslims to apply the previous methods. Thus the protesters who went to Medina found that the only legitimate way to elect the next caliph was a direct consultation to public opinions, and they finally agreed on the election of Imam 'Ali (a) as the caliph because of his numerous virtues. In spite of his own preferences to be an advisor, rather than a leader, Imam 'Ali (a) found it wrong to reject people's requests. In particular, he accepted to undertake the position because for him, the ultimate goal of a government was to maintain justice, and this was what people wanted then. Allegiance People pledged their allegiance (Bay'a) to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) on the condition of acting upon the Qur'an and the Prophet 's (s) tradition. He did not make the allegiance compulsory on the grounds that he was only obligated to call people to follow him, rather than coercing them to do so. Al-Iskafi has reported another allegiance that Imam 'Ali's (a) followers (Shi'as) made in order to befriend his friends and hate his enemies. This shows that the boundaries of Shi'a was being more clear-cut at that time. Performance Circumstances of caliphate in the period of Imam 'Ali (a) were distinct from those in the periods of his predecessors, both because of several political crises in which he was engaged from the very beginning, and because of his radically different approach to caliphate from the established, orthodox approach. One underlying reason for such a difference in approach was his rejection of Islamic caliphate both in its origination and its persistence—acquiescing it only out of exigence—but the most important reason underwriting such an approach of his was his firm belief that he himself was the immediate successor of the Prophet (s) both in political power and his spiritual position. Therefore, he was the elected leader of people and not only a caliph—a notion totally at odds with the system of caliphate. It is obvious that such a conception had particular consequences and implications for his conception of a government. Guidance in the Framework of the Divine Mission Unlike his predecessors, his religious leadership was not based on free ijtihad in modifying the Quranic laws and the tradition of the Prophet (s), but was in the framework of his divine mission, without taking himself equal to the Prophet (s) with respect to legislation. Political and Economic Dimensions In political and economic respects, like the religious ones, he followed the principles of the Prophet (s), including: Refusing from any coercion and oppression with respect to allegiance as well as his treatment of people who broke their allegiances ( Nakithun ) or people who disobeyed him. Undertaking the task of informing people of the right and wrong, both in public and in encounters with enemies—even those who drew their swords against him. Refusing to take military measures as much as possible. Determined combat against class, tribal and racist discriminations that were institutionalized during 25 years of the previous caliphs, and full commitment to justice. Conveyance of the Prophet's (s) Intellectual and Practical Tradition Imam 'Ali's main concern during the period of his caliphate was to convey the Prophet's (s) intellectual and practical tradition to people most of whom had forgotten, or were unfamiliar with, it; in fact, there was the fear that the essence of Islam was going to be dis-remembered. This is why he took the teaching of religion to be a main task of a government. He was determined to erect the flag of faith and inform them of halal (permissible) and haram (forbidden). The fact was even acknowledged by those of the Prophet's (s) companions who were still alive at that time. Problems of Imam 'Ali's (a) Government Because of such a conception of the government, Imam Ali 's (a) government encountered numerous problems, the most important of which were the occurrence of three civil wars during 4 years and branching of some Muslims into a different religious sect. There was once again a riot against the Caliph requesting his resignation. This time, without holding any talks or negotiations with the caliph, the riots announced his removal from power and, instead of a sit-in in the center of caliphate, they killed people. Unlike 'Uthman , Imam 'Ali (a), who believed in the effectiveness of dialogues, invited them to hold negotiations and make compromises, though to no avail. And whenever there was a military action, he first talked with them with reasoning and arguments and invited them to rethink their positions. The defeat of Khawarij in this battle could quench their riot since they had no foothold among people, but social and political diversities of that time left no opportunity for Imam 'Ali (a) to go on his reforms, and soon he was martyred by some Khawarij. al-Hasan b. Ali (a) Imam 'Ali's (a) martyrdom in 40 /661 complicated the critical circumstances of caliphate—in addition to political troubles, the geographical borders of caliphate were in danger, since Mu'awiya had declared the independence of Syria and Egypt from the center of caliphate. People nominated Imam 'Ali's (a) son, al-Hasan (a) for caliphate, since they deemed him to be competent to continue Imam 'Ali's (a) path. However, Imam 'Ali (a) left it to people to choose the next caliph. The election of Imam al-Hasan (a) as a caliph is evidence that some of Imam Ali's (a) doctrines were established among people. This is supported by the fact that people pledged their allegiance to Imam al-Hasan (a) on the condition that he acts upon the Qur'an and the Prophet's (s) tradition . Separation of Caliphate from Sultanate Later in one of his sermons, Imam al-Hasan (a) made a clear distinction between caliphate and sultanate in that the former has to be in accordance with the Qur'an and the Prophet's (s) tradition and should be based on justice. At that time, in Syria, Mu'awiya, who was an old enemy of Islam before the Conquest of Mecca and was appointed as the governor of Syria by the Second Caliph , was making a serious attempt to turn caliphate into sultanate, and of this Imam al-Hasan (a) and many Muslims were fully aware. That is why Imam al-Hasan's (a) priority, during his leadership, was to resist such attempts. Mu'awiya as the Rival of Caliphate The governmental system of Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan in Syria was a rival to the central caliphate. This was not resisted before Imam Ali's (a) caliphate, since Umar and Uthman who had appointed Mu'awiya as their agent in Syria, found it necessary to support him. However, Imam Ali (a) did not agree with this; he believed, instead, that the presence of Mu'awiya in power is pernicious for the Islamic nation, and this was why he took measures to remove him from power. Compromise with Mu'awiya Imam al-Hasan (a) tried to resist Mu'awiya, but the complicated predicaments of that time left him no choice other than to make a compromise with Mu'awiya. Thus six months after his election as the caliph, when there was an attempt to assassinate him, he resigned from caliphate and made a compromise or a peace treaty with Mu'awiya . According to al-Baladhuri , one of Imam al-Hasan's (a) conditions in his peace treaty was that Mu'awiya should not choose his successor on his own and should leave it, instead, to Muslims. Moreover, he is said to have disagreed with Mu'awiya's suggestion to overtake caliphate after him. These two positions reflect Imam al-Hasan's (a) worries about Mu'awiya's attempts to establish an inherited sultanate. These worries were soon confirmed, since on the very day when Imam al-Hasan's (a) peace treaty was signed, in a public speech Mu'awiya said that all his attempts were directed at establishing his power. Features of Rashidun Caliphs Imam al-Hasan (a) was the last caliph in the first chain of the Islamic Caliphate. He was one of the caliphs that came to be called Rashidun Caliphs who have had charismatic characters among later Sunni Muslims (Shia Muslims have a different view). Such a conception that can clearly be found in the work of Sunni authors of different periods, such as the fact that they were among the distinguished class of the Prophet 's (s) companions , their kinship with the Prophet (s) either by blood or by marriage , their early conversion to Islam, their assistance of the Prophet (s) in his goals, and their practical tradition (with the exception of the Third Caliph ). These features underpinned a significant difference between them and the later caliphs, and, above this, they turned into yardsticks against which the performance of political leaders in the Islamic community was evaluated. Governmental Approach of Rashidun Caliphs Their governmental approach was the basis on which some of the most important political and governmental laws of Sunni Muslims were founded. The following are some theories of this type in Sunni jurisprudence : Opinions of ahl al-hall wa l-'aqd (people of solutions and conventions) Principle of counseling (Shawra) Caliph should be from Quraysh Role of allegiance (Bay'a) as an expression of one's assent to a caliph Obligation of obeying the ruler and the prohibition of rising against him Permissibility or impermissibility of evicting a caliph Fighting with riots against a caliph. These are derived from the practice of Rashidun Caliphs as models of an Islamic government. Umayyad Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan The establishment of Umayyad Chaliphate in 41 /661-2 led to a legitimacy crisis for the Islamic caliphate. Mu'awiya was a caliph who was not seen by Muslims as similar to previous caliphs—he was not even well-reputed. In fact, most Muslims found it unbelievable to pledge their allegiance to him as a caliph, and this is why people of Kufa were coerced to pledge their allegiance to him. Even Mu'awiya himself stated that he had not seized caliphate with consent, rather by force. Ways of Legitimizing His Caliphate Mu'awiya had at his disposal some procedures to prove himself as a legitimate caliph. According to al-Jahiz, Mu'awiya called the year in which people pledged their allegiance to him \"the Year of Consensus\" ('Am al-Jama'a), that is, the year of consensus over one caliph. This was a widely accepted principle at that time that a caliph is legitimized by people's consensus. This is why some Sahaba refused to pledge their allegiance to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) in order to break consensus over his caliphate—ignoring another widely accepted principle at that time according to which a person agreed upon by people of al-Haramayn (that is, Mecca and Medina ), Muhajirun and Ansar is the caliph, which was exemplified in the case of Imam 'Ali (a). Such a pretext—that was later known, in the political fiqh of Sunni Muslims, as the principle of \"the rule of the dominant\"—was key to the legitimization of governments during the time of Mu'awiya and his successors, with which opponents were oppressed. The main goal of Mu'awaiya, as made explicit in his inauguration speech, was to turn caliphate into sultanate. He later called himself a king, declaring the end of caliphate. However, he finally came to see that he had better keep the titles of \"Khalifa\" (caliph) and \" Amir al-Mu'minin \" (ruler of the believers) for himself. Such a contradiction, though acceptable by his proponents in Syria who had been calling him \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" for a long time, wasn't so acceptable for others; but it was still believable since they used to conceive of Mu'awiya as the Kasra (King) of Arabs. It was obvious that the king of Arabs could not be similar to previous caliphs. He took himself to have the permission to deal with the Muslim treasury as his personal property and he even called himself the successor (Khalifa) of God and the king of God (Sultan Allah). He took his government to be a divine privilege for his own kinsman. This turned into a dominant view leading to the inheritance of caliphate among Banu Umayya , and turning the notion of Islamic caliphate into an Islamic sultanate. This was supported and confirmed by a hadith attributed to the Prophet (s) that \"there will be 30 years of caliphate and then there will be sultanate\". The Islamic aspect of such sultanate was the title \"Amir al-Mu'minin\", in addition to some superficial manifestations of Islam, such as moving the Prophet's (s) minbar and cane to Syria . Also, the title \"Sultan Allah\" (the King of God) was used to terrorize and oppress people. Such an approach—of terrorizing people—was key to establish Yazid as the caliph deputy. Yazid b. Mu'awiya The notion of caliph deputy or surrogate—which introduced the notion of an inherited crown prince in the structure of caliphate—implied that caliphate should continue among Banu Umayya , as it implied the demolition of the Islamic aspect of caliphate (especially with respect to the character of the caliph). However, things deteriorated when the caliph deputy became a caliph in 60 /679-80 he ignored all Islamic values and oppressed all opposition with violent force. In this period Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions were called \"Khariji\" (that is, outsiders of the religion), and people of Medina were forced to choose between death and pledging their allegiance to Yazid as slaves whose lives and properties were under the authority of the caliph. And in order to oppress al-Zubayris , they set Ka'ba to fire. This meant that the legitimacy of the caliph was no longer measured against his commitment to Islam; rather he was deemed as the yardstick of right and wrong. Even the rightest action, after testifying the oneness of God, was deemed to be the oppression of the caliph's opponents. However, uprisings such as Harra , Tawwabun and the uprising of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi , shows that such a conception of caliphate, though widespread, had serious opponents. In addition to the household of the Prophet (s) who expressed their position in the Battle of Karbala , some groups of Muslims, especially people of Mecca and Medina and Iraq expressed their opposition to such a conception. The arguments they made and the criteria they had for a desirable caliph are evidence of there being a strong intellectual movement whose adherents sought to put the caliphate back to its right track. One of these opponents who later claimed to be a caliph was 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr . 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr Though 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr did not rise as a caliph, he had such a claim a long time before that. After the death of Yazid in 64 /683-4, he called people to pledge their allegiance to him on the condition of acting upon the Qur'an , the Prophet's (s) tradition, and the practice of Rashidun Caliphs . This call was a return to the original form of caliphate as a political ideal. After the resignation of Mu'awiya b. Yazid from caliphate and the crises of Umayyad government, his caliphate went beyond Hijaz , where it began. Banu Marwan The caliphate of Banu Marwan began from 64 /683-4 and continued until 132 /749-50 with ten caliphs. They continued the Mu'awiya's heritage of sultanate and raised the spiritual authority of the caliph. A caliph as conceived by Banu Marwan was deemed as sacred, as manifested in titles such as \"Khalifat Allah fi l-Ard\" (God's successor on the Earth), \"Amin Allah\" (God's trustee), \"Ra'i Allah fi l-Ard\" (God's guardian on the Earth), \"Wali l-Haqq\" (the warden of the right), \"Wali 'Ahd Allah\" (the warden of God's promise), \"Imam al-Huda\" (the leader of guidance), \"al-Imam al-Mubarak\" (the blessed leader), and \"Khayar Allah li-l-Nas\" (God's choice for people). There were some people within the caliphate system that propagated such conceptions, such as those who fabricated some hadiths , especially poets who expressed a lot of sacred notions concerning caliphs. Hajjaj is quoted as using expressions such as the \"shadow of God\" or \"infallible both in speech and in practice by God's leave\" with respect to caliphs, claiming that wahy was still revealed to caliphs. It is indubitable that this approach had political purposes since under such conceptions it would be religiously legitimate to oppress the opponents. Opponents Shias , and groups of Muslims who were political proponents of Imam 'Ali (a) and his progeny, expressed their opposition to such a notion of caliphate by defending the uprisings of 'Alawis (as being qualified more than anyone else for the realization of Islamic ideals). Some of these people were attracted to the slogan of Banu 'Abbas , that is, \"the consent of the Prophet's (s) progeny\". They helped Banu 'Abbas, hoping that the caliphate comes back to the Prophet's (s) progeny. Things were different with 'Alawis. Some of them (Shiite Imams from the progeny of al-Husayn b. Ali (a) ) remained immune to the oppression of Banu Umayya , because they avoided public political and military activities, though they made attempts to propagate anti-caliphate ideas. Thus they could establish the intellectual and religious framework for Imamiyya Shiism. On the contrary, other groups of 'Alawis, such as Zaydis , took military action to be the best possible solution to oppose Banu Umayya. They had no success during the Umayyad period, because of strong oppressions, but they managed to establish governments in different parts of the Islamic world, though not always as caliphate. View of Khawarij Khawarij had a different position. They emphasized that caliphate was not restricted to Quraysh and this led to their deep political conflict with the standard idea of caliphate. They believed that every righteous, knowledgeable and brave Muslim could occupy caliphate. Even some of them believed that non-Arab Muslims and women could be caliphs. According to such a belief, they had their own non-Quraysh rulers who were called \"Amir al-Mu'minin\". They always conflicted with other Muslims with military action. Their rulers were elected by public appointments, and in case they deviated from religion or committed Major Sins , their followers could evict or kill them. More branching inside Khawarij and their dispersion in different areas of the Islamic world led to changes in their conception of the notion of caliphate. For instance, Najadat, a branch of Khawarij, rejected the need to an Imam or caliph if there is equality in the human community. According to this theory, Imamate or caliphate is not religiously obligatory, and when there is no need, it is not an obligation. Another branch of Khawarij, called 'Ajarida, believed that there can be two Imams or caliphs at the same time. Among Muslims Despite such diversity and plurality of views regarding the notion of caliphate, the political dominance and widespread propagations of Banu Umayya led to the prevalence of their conception of caliphate among Muslims in general, even after the Umayyad period. However, Banu Umayya themselves were not well-reputed among the majority of Muslims (both in their own time and later), because of the religious and political illegitimacy of their governments and their cruel treatments of the Prophet 's (s) Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Thus some Muslim authors refused to use the title \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" or \"Khalifa\" for Banu Umayya or appealed to the hadith according to which there will be thirty years of caliphate and then sultanate, in order to exclude the Umayyad rulers from caliphate. Even the reforms of two Umayyad caliphs, 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz and Yazid b. al-Walid , or attempts of some authors to justify the practice of Umayyad caliphs, did not improve Muslims' conception of Banu Umayya. Abbasid Abbasid was the third caliphate in Islam which lasted over five centuries ( 132 /74-50 - 656 /1258) by thirty-seven caliphs. Their motto was \"Al-Rida min Al Muhammad (s)\". Taking oath of allegiance to Saffah based on retaining Ahl al-Bayt 's (a) rights and return of succession as the divine heritage of Prophet Muhammad (s) and his family was the principles of Abbasid caliphate. Based on this governing system, hierarchy was an essential principle in the structure of the Abbasid caliphate. Taking the oath of allegiance to the caliph was carried out in a special ceremony written in the second and the third century after Hijrat . Ceremonies and rituals in different aspects of caliphate were necessary requirements for caliph and caliphate system. The first generations of Abbasid caliphs were holding high religious and political authority. They were able to rule with supreme political power as they were holding religious authority. However gradually their political authority declined, even the appointment and dismissal of caliphs, the longevity of their government and their lives were almost completely in the hands of Turk, Buyid and Seljuk military officials. Abbasid dynasty was eventually overthrown by the attacks of Hulagu Khan to Baghdad in 656/1258 which led to disappointment of those who regarded caliphate sacred. Also in different regions of Islamic territory some raised and claimed to be the caliph of Muslims. Fatimid Fatimid dynasty ruled for about 270 years (from 297 /909-10 to 567 /1171-2) by fourteen caliphs. They ruled over Egypt , Maghreb and the majority of Syria . Fatimids also managed to govern Diyarbakir, Rabi'a, Hijaz and Yemen in some periods of their caliphate. The intellectual system of the Fatimid caliphate had a complex and powerful administrative structure which was based on stabilization of caliphate and promotion of their religious outlook ( Isma'ili Shi'ism) all over the Islamic territories. Therefore, the Fatimid caliph was a caliph and an Imam (based on their own special meaning of Isma'ili Imam) who were holding a high spiritual status far more than Abbasid caliphs'. Fatimid caliphs had different titles including Amir al-Mu'minin, Wali Allah, Hujjat Allah, etc. After the death of Al-Mustansir in 487/1094-5 the court of Fatimid was divided into two groups who supported Musta'li and Nizari. They were competing over the succession and caliphate which led to the division of Fatimid territories and eventually their fall. Al-'Adid the last Fatimid caliph was entirely dominated by Salah al-Din Yusuf b. Ayyub, the Sunni Sultan who supported Abbasids. Al-'Adid's death in 567/1171-2 marked the end of the Fatimid caliphate. Ottomans Ottoman sultans were ruling over Russian Steppes to the Black Sea, a region in Europe and Africa, Iraq , Hijaz and Syria; they also managed to form a strong fresh government. When Ottomans conquered Egypt in 923 /1517-8 they officially attained caliphate. The Ottoman Sultan knew if they wanted to achieve caliphate, they had to relate themselves to the Abbasid caliph in Egypt; even Sultan Salim I, who founded Ottoman Caliphate tried to announce himself as an Abbasid caliph before claiming his caliphate. As Ottoman Sultans conquered parts of Iran, Anatolia, Hijaz , Syria, and north of Africa they made efforts to achieve caliphate of Muslims over Islamic territories. After the battle of Chaldiran in 920/1514-5 in which Sultan Salim defeated Safavids, he was then called \"Caliph of God and Prophet (s)\". However, the Ottoman caliphate never had a magnificent spiritual status. As they were non-Arab and non-Quraysh, and their lineage did not go back to Prophet Muhammad (s) Ottomans failed to attain spiritual authority. Also in the first century after caliphate of the Ottomans, a prominent Ottoman official wrote a Risala in which he tried to legitimate caliph and Imam for non-Quraysh (Ottoman) Sultans; it represents the fact that legitimacy of Ottoman caliphate was under question. In 1922-3 Grand National Assembly of Ankara, limited Ottoman caliphate to a spiritual level and separated it from ruling. After a year, Sultanate was replaced with Republic ruling system and Turkey became a Republic country. It was opposed with Muslims who favored caliphate especially notable figures including Sayyid Amir Ali Hindi a Twelver Shi'a and Aqa Khan (the leader of Isma'ilism), they traveled to Turkey and held meetings with the President and the Prime minister of the time to reconsider the decision. These actions failed eventually and in 1924-5 people of Turkey voted to abolition of caliphate ruling system. New Approaches to the Problem of Caliphate In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Muslim scholars proposed different theories regarding caliphate: 'Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi (d. 1320/1902-3) was an Egyptian intellectual who adopted an ethnic approach and sought the return of caliphate to Arabs, but he was not specifically an advocate of the caliphate system, rather he was an advocate of a form of a government which was not deemed sacred and did not lead to absolute power. Thus, he restricted the power of a caliph to that of a religious leader. Sayyid Jamal al-Din Asadabadi (1254/1838-9 ; 1314/1897): he had a positive view of caliphate and, in particular, the Ottoman caliphate. This approach is relevant to his ultimate motivations and goals, that is, the unification of the Islamic world, emancipation of Muslims from their regress and ignorance, and the recovery of their power and glory against colonialism. He believed in the revival of the power of caliphate (as an axis of the unification of the Islamic world), not in its traditional form, rather in a new framework (respecting citizen rights and mutual rights of the government and people). His positive optimistic approach turned into disappointment towards the end of his life as a result of misconducts of Istanbul 's caliphate and Abd al-Hamid II (the caliph of the time). Muhammad Rashid Rida (1282/1865-6 ; 1354/1935-6): he was a strong advocate of the caliphate. He was at first a supporter of the Ottoman caliphate. However, in the wake of the separation of the Ottoman caliphate from monarchy in 1922-3 and the spread of Arabic nationalism, he turned into an opponent of the Ottoman caliphate (taking it to be a deviation from the proper system of caliphate). Thus, Rashid Rida adopted the same approach as Kawakibi's to the problem of the Arabic caliphate. 'Abd al-Razzaq Ahmad Sanhuri (1313/1895-6 ; 1391/1971-2): in an attempt to merge the system of caliphate and the independence of Muslim governments, Sanhuri proposed the establishment of Islamic international organizations. These organizations were supposed to take the place of the institution of caliphate by creating cultural relations and an ideological-cultural unification among Muslim people. In this proposal, the caliph was an honorary head of all Islamic governments with religious power and without any political power. Abu l-Kalam Azad (1305/1887-8 ; 1377/1957-8): he gave an account of the system of caliphate as a government based on the Qur'an , decisively defended such a system, and emphasized on the election of the caliph through the votes of \"Ahl al-Hall wa l-'Aqd\" (qualified people). After the collapse of the Ottoman caliphate, he turned to nationalistic views and even justified the non-religious policies of Atatürk. Abu l-A'la Mawdudi (1321/1903-4 ; 1399/1978-9): he defended the system of caliphate on the basis of an ideal theory of caliphate. However, he did not take caliphate to be restricted to the Quraysh or any other tribe, ethnicity, or group. He also considered the power of the caliph to be limited and restricted. He also emphasized the division and independence of powers in the political structure of caliphate. He took the caliph to be a representative of people, and thus, he leaned towards democracy. Others: according to Malek Bennabi, an Algerian intellectual, there was a democratic government before the Battle of Siffin . He was optimistic about the return of Muslims to the original Islamic democracy (with an emphasis on values such as freedom of speech and thought and emancipation from tyranny). However, he never talked about the revival of the system of caliphate in his work. Hasan al-Banna (1324/1906-7 ; 1368/1948-9), the leader of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , suggested a similar view in a different way. While he considered the caliphate to be a principle of Islam and a ground for the unification of the Islamic world, he highlighted the religious role of the institution of caliphate. Revive of Islamic Caliphate After the abolition of caliphate of the Ottomans, some made efforts to revive the Islamic caliphate. Mawlana Muhammadullah popularly known as Hafezzi Huzur in Bangladesh founded a movement similar to caliphate which included huge political and religious movements as he tried to revive the Islamic caliphate. Supporters of Hafezzi Huzur were politically active in Bangladesh in the 1980s which included some Islamic groups. It led to massive internal disputes between supporters of Hafezzi and the government of Bangladesh. Eventually, the leaders of Hafezzi Huzur movement were arrested and Hafezzi Huzur was put in house arrest; the activities of this movement were also restricted. In addition, Jamal al-Din b. Rashid Kablan (Khuja Ughlu) the Turkish religious scholar, declared caliphate in 1990s as the only legitimate Islamic government. It was founded based on traditional fiqh principles on caliphate as well as requirements of the modern world. Kablan's plan was almost similar to 'Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri's, the only difference was that El-Sanhuri regarded caliph as the highest administrative position in Islamic world and he emphasized on revival of traditions such as taking oath of allegiance, having Lunar calendar and exercising Shari'a laws. He also concentrated on selecting Istanbul as the spiritual capital of caliphate. ISIS is the most recent group that claimed caliphate over Islamic territories.

{"title": "Generative Guardianship", "text": "Al-Wilāyat al-takwīnīyya (Arabic: الولاية التَكوينية ), also known as Generative Authority or Generative Guardianship , refers to a supernatural power that encompasses the ability to manipulate the universe and its entities. It pertains to God 's authority to control and govern all aspects of creation. Within the context of Shiism, the ascription of generative authority to the Prophet (s) and the Imams of the Shi'a (a) has been a subject of discussion. Furthermore, it is a topic explored in Islamic mysticism. In the works of Shia scholars, generative authority is indeed attributed to the Prophet (s) and the Imams of the Shi'a (a). However, there exist two perspectives concerning the extent and limitations of their generative authority. According to the first perspective, the generative authority of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) is not comprehensive; rather, it is specific to certain matters. This includes the ability to perceive the inner thoughts of others and the power to perform extraordinary manipulations of beings. On the other hand, the second viewpoint suggests that their generative authority extends to the entirety of existence, encompassing all aspects from birth to the death of all entities. It is through the Prophet and Imams that God bestows His grace upon the universe, serving as a conduit for divine blessings. Definition Generative authority, or al-wilayat al-takwiniyya, encompasses a supernatural power that enables the manipulation of existence and entities within the world. It signifies God's inherent ability to govern and manipulate all aspects of the universe. Additionally, an individual who has attained spiritual perfection may, with God's permission, possess the capacity to perform extraordinary manipulations within existence. Instances of generative authority include various phenomena, such as miracles and supernatural acts demonstrated by prophets (a) and Imams (a) . These extraordinary manifestations consist of feats such as tayy al-ard (teleportation or covering long distances instantaneously), walking on water, perceiving the inner thoughts of others, communicating with animals, separating the soul from the body, and manipulating nature through the utilization of spiritual power. What is the Problem of Generative Authority? Within Islamic sources, the issue of generative authority primarily revolves around humans. The central question is whether or not humans can possess generative authority, and if so, what its extent and limitations are. Generative authority should not be confused with instances where an individual prays to God and their requests are fulfilled . Rather, it relates to the level of spiritual attainment and servitude to God that grants an individual the ability to manipulate nature to some degree. It is essential to emphasize that this ability to manipulate is only possible with God's permission and sanction. Origin of the Problem Morteza Motahhari (d. 1399 / 1979 ) suggests that the problem of generative authority holds significance in both mystical and religious contexts, particularly within Shia Islam. However, historical evidence indicates that the doctrine of generative authority in mysticism has been derived from Shiism. Imams of the Shia have transmitted hadiths regarding the concept of \" delegation \" of affairs by God to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a). These hadiths present varying perspectives, with some endorsing the idea of delegation and others rejecting it. According to a study, the problem of generative authority emerged within Islamic mysticism in the third/nineth century, specifically under the concept of \"wilaya.\" It continued to be discussed in the realm of Islamic mysticism until Muhyi l-Din al-ʿArabi (d. 638/1240), who further elaborated on the matter. Interestingly, the term \"al-wilayat al-takwiniyya\" was first introduced by Shi'a scholars in more recent centuries, as highlighted in the study. Generative Authority of the Prophet and Imams Shia scholars maintain the belief that both the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) possess generative authority, yet there exists disagreement among them regarding the extent of this authority. There are scholars, such as Morteza Motahhari, Safi Gulpayigani , and Ja'far Subhani , who believe that the Infallibles (a) possess the ability to manipulate nature in exceptional cases. However, they emphasize that this authority is not all-encompassing, and it does not imply that the Infallibles manage every aspect of the world, including creation, birth, and death, on behalf of God. On the other hand, scholars like al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Shaykh al-Mufid reject the notion of God’s delegating the affairs of the world to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a), considering it a position held by extremists or exaggerators (ghulat). On the contrary, scholars like Muhammad Husayn Gharawi Isfahani , also known as al-Kumpani, and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Husayni Tihrani , known as Allama Tihrani, hold the belief that the Prophet (s) and Imams possess generative authority over all aspects of the world. They argue that the Prophet (s) and Imams act as intermediaries or channels through which God's grace flows into the universe.

{"title": "Imamate of the Twelve Imams (a)", "text": "Imāmate of the Twelve Imāms (a) (Arabic: إمامة الأئمة الاثني عشر ) refers to divine guardianship and special wilaya of the twelve successors of the Seal of the Prophets (s) . According to Twelver Shi'a teachings, twelve infallible ones among the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) have guardianship and imamate over others and they are appointed to this position by God . Thus, the Twelver Shi'a are also called Ithna 'Ashari Shi'a . The names of the Twelve Imams, in order of their imamate, are: Ali (a) , al-Hasan (a) , al-Husayn (a) , Ali (a) , Muhammad (a) , Ja'far (a) , Musa (a) , Ali (a) , Muhammad (a) , Ali (a) , al-Hasan (a) , and Muhammad (a) . Proofs for Imamate can be categorized into two groups: hadiths , and Imams' (a) qualities. First Proof: Hadiths of the Twelve Caliphs One of the proofs for the imamate of the twelve Imams (a) is the hadiths in which the number of the Prophet's (s) caliphs are restricted to twelve people, all of whom are from Quraysh . In addition to Shi'a references, these hadiths are also mentioned in Sunni references such as Sahih Muslim , Sahih Ibn Hibban , Jami' al-Tirmidhi , Sunan Ibn Dawud , Sunan Ibn Maja , Musnad Ibn Hanbal , Musnad Ibn Ja'd , Musnad Abu Ya'la , Kanz al-'ummal . In some of these hadiths, the Prophet (s) mentioned these twelve persons as \"Ithna 'Ashar Khalifa\" [the Twelve caliphs] such as the hadith, \"After me, there will be twelve caliphs who are from Quraysh\"; or saying \"this religion will be powerful and invincible as long as twelve caliphs rule it.\" And \"Islam will be standing until twelve caliphs rule, who are all from Quraysh\" and other such hadiths. In some hadiths, the Prophet (s) called imams after him as \"Ithna 'Ashar Amiran\" [the Twelve Emirs]. In some other hadiths, the number of the Prophet's (s) caliphs are considered the same as the Chieftains of Banu Israel after Moses (a) , such as in, \"the number of caliphs after me is the same as the number of the chiefs of Banu Isra'il\" and that \"the caliphs after me are twelve the same as the number of the chiefs of Banu Isra'il.\" Some Sunni researchers have said that twelve people from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are meant by the twelve people mentioned in hadiths because the people in these hadiths cannot be matched with other people, neither with the caliphs after the Prophet (s) , since they are less than twelve people, nor with Umayyad rulers, since they were more than twelve. Moreover, Umayyad rulers were very tyrant and they were not Hashemite . The twelve people mentioned in hadiths cannot be matched with Abbasid caliphs either since they were more than twelve. Therefore, inevitably, these hadiths from the Prophet (s) would only match the twelve Imams (a) from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s), because they were superior to others in knowledge, dignity, God-wariness, and lineage. Hadith al-Thaqalayn and similar hadiths are proofs for the fact that by the twelve imams, the Prophet (s) actually meant twelve people of his Ahl al-Bayt (a). Second Proof: Hadiths Containing the Names of Imams (a) The second type of hadiths includes those in which the Prophet (s) has mentioned the number of his caliphs as twelve, introduced them, and said that they are from his Ahl al-Bayt (a). These hadiths are in some groups: 1. In the first group of such hadiths, Imam 'Ali (a) is mentioned as the first Imam and Imam al-Mahdi (a) as the last Imam, such as in, \"The Imams after me are twelve; first one of whom is 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and the last one is the Upriser (al-Qa'im). Obeying them is obeying me and disobeying them is disobeying me. Anyone who denies them has denied me.\" Elsewhere, he (s) said, \"The Imams after me are twelve; the first one of whom is 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and their last one is the Upriser (a) (al-Qa'im). They are my successors and caliphs, and friends and divine proofs over my people after me. Those who acknowledge their imamate is a believer and those who deny them are disbelievers .\" 2. The second group of hadiths are those in which the Prophet (s) has mentioned nine Imams after himself from the progeny of Imam al-Husayn (a) , the last one of whom is the Upriser (a) (al-Qa'im). Abu Dharr narrated from the Prophet (s) that, \"Imams (a) after me are twelve; nine of whom are from the progeny of Imam al-Husayn (a) and the ninth of whom is their Upriser (a) (al-Qa'im). Beware that the Twelve Imams (a) among you are like the Arc of Noah (a) , anyone who boards it will survive and anyone who does not board it will perish.\" 3. In another group of hadiths, the Prophet (s) only mentions the common names among Imams (a) such as, \"Imams (a) after me are twelve, first one of whom is Ali (a), the fourth of whom is 'Ali (a), the eighth of whom is 'Ali (a), the tenth of whom is 'Ali (a), and their last one is al-Mahdi .\" Or the hadith saying that \"Imams after me are twelve persons of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the first of whom is 'Ali (a) and the middle one of whom is Muhammad (a) and the last one of whom is Muhammad (a), and he (a) is the al-Mahdi of my people, whom Jesus (a) , son of Mary (a) , will follow in prayer.\" 4. In the final group of hadiths, the Prophet (s) introduced the Twelve Imams (a) with their names and titles in full. In a hadith known as the hadith al-Lawh , the names of the Twelve Imams (a) are mentioned with their special descriptions. Third Proof: Infallibility The third proof of the imamate of Imams (a) is their infallibility . In some hadiths, Imams (a) of Ahl al-Bayt (a) are mentioned as having the merit of infallibility. These hadiths, in fact refer to the rational argument for the imamate of Imams (a) of the Ahl al-Bayt (a); since, from a rational point of view, Imam (a) is required to be infallible and because no one except Imams (a) have been infallible among the people, then their imamate is proven. Fourth Proof: Superiority Another proof for the imamate of the Twelve Imams (a) is their superiority in moral virtues; it can be explained that having superiority in perfections and unique qualities such as knowledge , infallibility , etc. over others, Imams (a) of Shi'a deserve to take the position of imamate and leadership of people. It is obvious that with their presence, prioritizing others for imamate is rationally unwise and wrong. Besides many hadiths that allude to the superiority of Imams (s), the philosophy of imamate requires that due to the significance of the mission imam has about the guidance and leadership of people in religion and worldly matters, imam should be superior and most competent of all people so that they consider him as a role model in all perfections and follow him. This requires the purity of Imam and his possession of the noblest of human manners and merits. From this point of view, any one of the Twelve Imams (a) of the Shi'a have been so perfect in their time that anyone has acknowledged the greatness of their character, and even those who debated or argued with them would express humbleness against their scientific and spiritual grandeur. Fifth Proof: Miracles Another proof for the imamate of the Twelve Imams (a) of the Shi'a is the miracles and wonders they (a) made. Making such miracles have been of the following types: They (a) sometimes foretold about the future, and they would happen exactly the way Imams (a) had foretold. They (a) sometimes explained facts from the unseen world , no one would ever be able to learn through normal ways. They (a) sometimes showed some knowledge in their childhood in a manner that everyone would feel humble before them. They (a) sometimes showed a spiritual power over the creation such as, Hajar al-Aswad 's speaking by order of Imam al-Sajjad (a) and acknowledging the Imamate of Imam al-Sajjad (a). [22] Production of dates by a dried palm tree by order of Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba (a) . [23] Imam al-Baqir's (a) giving full eyesight to Abu Basir and then turning him back to the way he was before, out of Abu Basir's own request. [24] And many more acts of wonder reported from Imams (a) and mentioned in authentic historical and hadith references such as al-Kafi , Ibn Shahr Ashub 's al-Manaqib , al-Mas'udi 's Ithbat al-wasiyya , al-Tabari 's Dala'il al-imama , etc. Making such acts of wonder by the infallible Imams (a) which has been accompanied with the claim of Imamate is a proof for their Imamate, the same way the Prophet's (s) miracles were a definite proof for the validity of their claim of prophethood .

{"title": "Ilm al-Ghayb", "text": " ʿĪlm al-ghayb (Arabic: عِلمُ الغَیب ) or knowledge of the unseen or knowledge of the hidden is a sort of divine knowledge that is inaccessible to normal human beings, but according to Islam , some human beings may possess such knowledge if God allows them to. According to Shiite doctrines, knowledge of the unseen or the hidden is exclusively possessed by God, but for some reasons, it is also endowed to some human beings. However, some sorts o'f such knowledge are necessarily specific to God and cannot be shared by human beings, such as God's knowledge of His essence (dhat), which is a type of His knowledge of the hidden that is impossible for human beings to possess. According to religious doctrines, the prophets (a) (or at least some of them), the Prophet (s) , Shiite Imams (a) and some righteous persons might possess the knowledge of the hidden. The scope of such knowledge that they may possess is different, the highest degree of such knowledge being enjoyed by the Prophet (s) and his Successors , according to Shiites. There have been two theories about Imams' scope of knowledge of the unseen among Shiite scholars: minimalism and maximalism. Recent Shiite scholars hold to an unlimited scope of such knowledge for Imams (a). The Notion The word \"ghayb\" (Arabic: غَیب ) literally means what is unseen or hidden, in contrast to the word \"shuhud\" (intuition)( شُهود ) which refers to whatever is observable by our senses. In Qur'anic and hadith terminology, ghayb is what cannot be known by virtue of normal cognitive apparatuses. The phrase \"'ilm al-ghayb\" means knowing the ghayb, the unseen—that is, knowledge of what cannot be known by the senses. Types of Ghayb According to one classification, there are two types of ghayb or unseen: What is revealed via learning, reflection, and intellectual exercise. What can only be accessed and known by God or whoever God allows to. The latter is in turn of two types: What needs to be revealed to the prophets and messengers of God, such as miracles , religious truths, and other information of the unseen. What is so specific to God that He does not allow anyone else to know. [4] Nobody except God can know such things through observations or reflections or whatever cognitive faculties. One example of this is divine essence. [5] The Possibility of Knowledge of the Unseen According to Islamic doctrines, God can let some people know about the unseen—what has happened before or what is going to happen in the future. Here is a Qur'anic verse: “ \"He knows what before or after or behind them, nor shall they compass aught of his knowledge except as he wills\" (Qur'an 2:255). ” Ibn Sina provides an experimental argument for the possibility of such knowledge for human beings: Just as it is possible for human beings to know about the unseen (in the past or the future) in their veridical dreams, it is also possible for them to possess such knowledge when they are awake. The Prophets' Knowledge of the Unseen Allah will not acquaint you with the Unseen, but Allah chooses whomever He wishes from His apostles. ~ Sura Al Imran verse no.179 One capacity that is required for a person to be a prophet at all is knowledge of some unseen truths. God reveals to the prophets some past or future truths that no normal human person has access to. The Qur'an has referred to Jesus Christ (a) 's knowledge of some unseen things: “ \"And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses\" (Qur'an 3: 49). ” Also there is a Qur'anic verse to the effect that God gives whatever knowledge of the unseen to his prophets: “ \"He (alone) knows the unseen, nor does he make any one acquainted with His mysteries, (26) except a messenger whom He has chosen: and then He makes a band of watchers march before Him and behind Him\" (Qur'an 72: 26-27). ” According to some scholars of the Qur'anic exegesis , Qur'an 3: 179 shows that all the prophets possessed knowledge of the unseen, especially given that the pronoun in this verse refers to anyone who is chosen by God. The Prophet's (s) Knowledge of the Unseen It has been thought that among the prophets, Prophet Muhammad (s) possessed the widest scope of knowledge of the unseen. By the leave of God, he had knowledge of whatever he needed in order to accomplish his mission . There is a mention, in the Qur'an, of information of which the Prophet (s) was aware, pointing out that he was not aware of this before his prophecy: “ \"Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which we have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them\" (Qur'an, 11: 49). ” Imams' Knowledge of the Unseen According to Shiite beliefs, Imams (a) need to have comprehensive knowledge of the laws of Shari'a which they are supposed to protect against distortions and whose ambiguities they are supposed to clarify. If Imam (a) does not have such knowledge, God's goal of appointing him for such a position—to clarify and protect the laws of Shari'a—would be flouted. Therefore, it is required for Imam (a) to have complete knowledge of whatever he needs in order to clarify and protect the religion. Since such knowledge is very wide and cannot be acquired by normal human capacities, it is necessary that Imam (a) has part of such knowledge by non-normal, super-human capacities and in non-normal ways. Shiite View about Imam's Knowledge According to Shiites, just like prophets, the infallible Imam (a) receives his knowledge of the unseen from God, and his knowledge is intuitive, that is, it will be accessible to him whenever he wants (it is not required that the knowledge be actual all the time). According to some hadiths , whenever Imam (a) wants to know something, God will give him the knowledge thereof. There are narrations, in Shiite hadiths, of some information and prediction of the unseen (the past or the future events) by Imams of the Shi'a (a). Some of this can be found in several sermons of Nahj al-balagha , such as Imam Ali (a) 's prediction of the devastation of Kufa , Abd al-Malik Marwan 's attack to Kufa, prediction of Hajjaj b. Yusuf al-Thaqafi 's bloodshed and his overeating, information about the bloody future of Basra , news about the rule of four vice people from sons of Marwan , and the prediction of Moguls' attacks and their crimes. The View of Imamiyya Theologians There are some major views about Imam's knowledge of the unseen among Shiite theologians : Imam's absolute and actual knowledge of the unseen about the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfuz) and \" lawh al-mahw wa al-ithbat \" (the Elimination and Addition Tablet). Imam's absolute and actual knowledge only of the Elimination and Addition Tablet. Imam's knowledge of the unseen only conditionally upon request from God. Agnosticism about the details of Imam's knowledge of the unseen. Limited knowledge of Imam (a) to some things which are required for his imamate and leadership. [23] The Scope of Imam's Knowledge of the Unseen According to Shiite beliefs, Imam's knowledge includes everything he needs in his imamate and leadership. Some Shiite hadiths tell us that the scope of Imam's knowledge of the unseen includes everything that has occurred or is going to occur in the world (maximalism), and that God does not appoint someone as Imam unless he is capable of responding to people's questions. Here are some instances of Imam's knowledge of the unseen: Imam's knowledge of the Qur'an , its absolute (mutlaq) and limited (muqayyad) statements, general and particular statemnets, and al-nasikh wa al-mansukh (verses that abrogate other verses, and ones that are abrogated). Knowledge of other Sacred Scriptures. Knowledge of whatever has happened or is going to happen in the future. Knowledge of deaths and catastrophes. [26] Knowledge of all mundane and afterlife affairs. [27] Knowledge of the way, and the time, of his own death / martyrdom . [28] Knowledge of divine mysteries. [29] Knowledge of divine laws. [30] Imam's Ways of Access to Knowledge of the Unseen According to Shiite sources, Imam (a) has different ways of access to the unseen or hidden information, including: a. Receiving the knowledge from the Prophet (s) : there is a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) according to which Imam has received his knowledge from the Prophet (s), who has received it in turn from Jabra'il (Gabriel). And there is a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) according to which Imams (a) possess knowledge of what God has taught his angels and prophets (a) . This sort of teaching is done in different ways: Normal teachings: in this way of teaching, Imam Ali (a) heard the Prophet's (s) words, just like other people, though (because of his capacities) he has learned much more. [33] Non-normal ways: in this way of teaching, which is specific to Imams (a) , they have received the teachings via unusual ways, such as the following: The knowledge that the Prophet (s) gave to Imam Ali (a) in the last hours of his life. According to some hadiths, in those moments he received from the Prophet (s) a vast amount of knowledge equivalent to one thousand sections in each of which there were a thousand other sections of knowledge. It included knowledge of past and future events, catastrophes and judgments. This knowledge is, according to Shiites, a heritage of imamate that is transferred from one Imam to his successor. [34] Through kitab al-jami'a (the Comprehensive Book): according to Shiites, this is a book written down by Imam Ali (a) from what the Prophet (s) told him, including news and information needed by an Imam, and this is also transferred from one Imam to his successor, according to Shiites. [35] Through kitab al-jafr (the Book of Jafr): this book is, according to some hadiths, a heritage of the prophets and their successors, containing the information had by prophets and Israelite scholars. It also contains Zabur which is the book of the Prophet Dawud (a) , Torah which is the book of Prophet Moses (a) , Gospel which is the book of Jesus (a) , and Suhuf which is the book of Prophet Ibrahim (a) . [36] b. Through Mushaf Fatima (a) (the Book of Fatima (a)): according to some hadiths, the Book of Fatima is a collection of Lady Fatima al-Zahra's (a) conversations with angels, containing information about future events until the Resurrection . Lady Fatima (a) reported them to Imam Ali (a) and he wrote them down. There is a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) according to which the Book of Fatima contains information about the future. c. Through revelation and conversation with angels: Hassan b. Yahya al-Mada'ini asked Imam al-Sadiq (a) about how Imam answers the questions he is asked, and he replied: sometimes it is revealed to him, sometimes he hears it from an angel, and sometimes both. The Benefits of Imams' Knowledge of the Unseen According to Muhammad Rida Muzaffar , there are some benefits for Imams' knowledge of the unseen: Benefits for the Islamic Umma . Increasing the power of Islamic leaders. The completion of the divine grace in His appointment of Imams (a) . [40] Arguments and Evidence for Imams' Knowledge of the Unseen According to some hadiths, Imam is the heir of the prophets' knowledge and the treasure of divine knowledge. Shiites appeal to some hadiths to argue for this doctrine, including the hadith from the Prophet (s) : \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\". According to a hadith, after Hisham b. al-Hakam heared Imam al-Sadiq's (a) answers to 500 problems in theology , he told the Imam: I know that the problems of halal and haram are in your hands, but is this knowledge of kalam? Imam al-Sadiq (a) replied: Woe to you, Hisham! God does not appoint an Imam for people unless he has (knowledge of) everything people need. Knowledge of the Unseen by Other People Knowledge of the unseen is not limited to prophets and Shiite infallible Imams (a) ; some other people might have degrees of such knowledge. There are references in the Qur'an to some of such people: Mary (a) , Jesus's mother. Ibrahim 's (a) wife. Moses 's mother. Khidr (a) , the companion of Moses (a) . Believers who witness the hypocrites. The companion of Sulayman (a) , that is, Asif b. Barkhiya . Problems Concerning Knowledge of the Unseen There are problems about, and objections to, Imams' knowledge of the unseen. Shiite scholars of kalam have tried to provide replies to these objections. Here are some of these objections: If Imams have knowledge of the hidden, then how should we deal with hadiths in which it is made explicit that they do not possess such knowledge? For example, there is a hadith in which someone told Imam al-Sadiq (a) that Imam has knowledge of the unseen, but he said: \"I do not have such knowledge\". And as evidence for this he added: \"My bondwoman has done something wrong and I want to punish her, but I cannot find her\". [51] This objection, as scholars of theology have said, arises from ignorance of the whole body of hadiths in this regard. According to Qur'anic evidence and hadiths, Shiite Imams (a) possess knowledge of the unseen. Therefore, hadiths that deny such a quality are either maj'ul (fabricated) or have been stated in taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) . The evidence for this is the very hadith cited in the objection. In the rest of this hadith, when Imam (a) and the narrator go somewhere else where nobody else is present, the Imam (a) cites a Qur'anic verse and says that he has knowledge of the unseen, and indeed an Imam should have such knowledge in order to accomplish his missions and responsibilities. If Imams (a) were aware of the time and the cause of their martyrdoms , they had to prevent them, rather than let them happen. For example, if Imam Ali (a) knew that he would be hit in the head by a sword at the 19th night of the month of Ramadan in the Mosque of Kufa , then he was religiously obliged not to go there, because it would count as suicide, which is religiously forbidden. There have been several replies to this objection: Some people maintain that Imams (a) do not have knowledge of some events, knowing which is not required for their missions (in imamate and the leadership of Muslims), and the time and cause of their martyrdoms are such events. [53] Others have distinguished between external and internal knowledge, believing that Imams (a) possessed both types of knowledge. But they have to comply with the implications of external knowledge (what is available to all people), accomplishing their social responsibilities on the basis of such knowledge. However, they had internal knowledge of all events, including their own fates, but they were still obliged to act upon their external knowledge. Therefore, they were not allowed to prevent their deaths, drawing upon their internal knowledge. [54] Most Shiite scholars have tended to accept the second reply to the objection.

{"title": "Imamate", "text": "Imamate (Arabic: الإمامة ), from Shi'a point of view, is the leadership of the Islamic society, designated by God to succeed the Prophet (s) in all religious and worldly affairs. It is among the principles of Shi'a school and one of the points of difference between Shi'a and Sunnis . The importance of this principle among Shi'a led them to be titled as Imamiyya . According to Shi'a teachings, the Prophet (s) made a lot of efforts to introduce his caliph and the leader of Muslims after himself since the beginning of his mission. His efforts towards this aim began since his first public invitation by introducing 'Ali (a) as his caliph and successor and continued until the last days of his life on the way back from Farewell Hajj on Dhu l-Hijja 18 in event of Ghadir Khumm . Sunni Muslims also emphasize on the necessity of an Imam and to obey him, however, they believe that it is upon the Muslim umma to elect an Imam and that the Prophet (s) has not appointed any person as his successor. During history, Shi'a have found different opinions about the number and instances of Imams. According to Imamiyya Shi'a, the number of Imams (a) is twelve; the first of whom was Imam 'Ali (a) after Imam 'Ali (a), Imam al-Hasan (a) and then his brother Imam al-Husayn (a) became Imam and after these three, nine descendants of Imam al-Huasyn (a) became Imam one after another and the last Imam is Imam al-Mahdi (a) .. The reason behind Imam's existence is to safeguard and transfer religion and correctly explain religious teachings; therefore, to perform his duties properly, it is necessary for an Imam to have the power to abandon sins , God-given knowledge and Wilaya (guardianship) from God . Meaning  Literally, imamate means leadership and the word \"imam\" refers to one or thing followed by people. Accordingly, different examples for this meaning have been provided in Arabic dictionaries such as the Qur'an , the Prophet's (s) successor, imam of congregational prayer , a commander of an army, a guide of passengers, a caravan leader, a camel herder, and a scholar who is followed. In the Qur'an In the Qur'an the word \"imam\" is used both for some human beings and for referring to other issues; non-human usages of this word are: preserved tablet (al-Lawh al-mahfuz), an open highway and the Book of Moses (a) . The usage of this word for humans has been two kinds: imam of the truth and imam of the falsehood. The cases of the imam of the truth are: prophets (a), righteous servants of God and the oppressed. Leaders of disbelief such as Pharaoh and his agents are imams of the falsehood in the Qur'an. Also in some cases, the word \"imam\" is used including all the mentioned usages, \"The day We shall summon every group of people with their imam\" ( Quran 17 :71). Technical Meaning Theologians have defined imamate in two ways; Some definitions are general and include prophethood as well; for example, it has been defined as the \"general leadership in religious and worldly issues\". The second definitions are those which regard imamate as the succession of the Prophet (s) in religious affairs and consider following imam obligatory. Given the above mentioned points, it can be said that the definition of imamate as the \"leadership of the Islamic society in religious and worldly affairs as the successor of the Prophet (s)\" is accepted by all Islamic schools. In the View of Shi'a Shi'a regards imamate one of the Islamic doctrines of faith, but Mu'tazilites , 'Asharites , and other Islamic schools consider it among secondary beliefs . Accordingly, Shi'a have a more prominent position for imamate compared with Sunnis . In Shi'a culture, imamate includes more duties and responsibilities, in addition to those of a caliph. Its importance can be clearly understood from verses of the Qur'an and hadiths about imamate because according to Shi'a, imamate is in fact a matter similar to prophethood. Relation with Caliphate The special position of imamate among Muslims also becomes obvious when the matter is historically studied. After the Prophet (s) passed away, the most important and critical issue debated and discussed among Muslims was imamate. No other religious teaching has ever been argued over like imamate has. Leadership of the Islamic society after the Prophet (s) is called both caliphate and imamate and the one who take over this position is called both caliph and imam. From the point that people have to follow him, he is called imam and from the point that his leadership is in succession of the Prophet (s), he is called caliph. Therefore in Islam , imam is the caliph and successor of the Prophet (s). However, about the question whether he can be called as \"Khalifat Allah\" (vicegerent of Allah), there are two opinions among Sunni scholars; some regarded it permissible and some others considered it impermissible. Ahl al-Bayt (a) have also regarded imamate as succession of God and His Prophet (s). As a Divine Pledge The Qur'an has regarded imamate higher than prophethood , because about the Prophet Abraham (a) , it has mentioned that after he (a) achieved the position of prophethood and was successful in trials and divine tests, the position of imamate was granted to him, \"and when his Lord tested Abraham (a) with certain words, and he fulfilled them, He said, 'I am making you the Imam of mankind.' Said he, 'And from among my descendants?' He said, 'My pledge does not extend to the unjust.'\" ( Qur'an 2 :124) Moreover, in this verse, God refers to imamate as His pledge. Therefore, this position is not subject to election by people. This has also been mentioned in hadiths . As the Cause of Religion's Perfection The importance of imamate is evident in hadiths mentioned about the al-Ikmal Verse (perfection of religion). According to these hadiths, the mentioned verse has been revealed about the event of Ghadir Khumm when by the order of God, the Prophet (s) introduced 'Ali (a) as the leader of Islamic society after himself. Accordingly, Islam reached its desired perfection through imamate. The al-Tabligh Verse is also referring to the same issue; since, according to this verse and the hadiths about the cause of its revelation , imamate has such a great position that if the Prophet (s) did not announce it, it was as if he (a) had not accomplished his mission and his efforts would be lost. On the Day of Judgment According to the Qur'an , on the Day of Judgment , everyone goes to his own leader, \"The day We shall summon every group of people with their imam\" (Qur'an 17:71). This is also mentioned in a hadith both Shi'a and Sunnis have narrated from Imam al-Rida (a) , it says that on the Day of Judgment, every group is summoned by their divine book and the tradition of their prophet and leader. Imam 'Ali (a) said, \"Imams (a) are God's guides and leaders for His servants and no one will enter the paradise unless he knows them and they know him and no one will enter the hell unless he rejects them and they reject him.\" In many hadiths narrated from Imams (a), it is mentioned that prayer , zakat , fasting , hajj , and wilaya are the pillars of Islam , among which wilaya has a better position because it is the key and guide to the rest. Necessity of the Existence of Imam (a) From the viewpoint of Twelver Shi'a theologians , imamate is incumbent and its necessity is theological; i.e. it is incumbent upon God , not necessary for people. The meaning of this necessity is that it is a matter required by justice, wisdom, grace, and other attributes of God's perfection; and since, abandoning it implies a deficiency in God and thus impossible, thus doing it is necessary and incumbent upon God. However, this obligation roots in God's attributes of perfection, not an outside obligation. As God has made mercy and guidance obligatory upon Himself, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi says, \"Twelver Shi'a believe that appointment of Imam is an act of grace; because it draws people near to obedience and away from disobedience; and that grace is incumbent upon God.\" Non-Shi'a Schools Most Islamic schools consider imamate necessary, even though there is a disagreement about whether it is a jurisprudential, theological, or rational obligation. 'Asharites regard it obligatory but because they do not believe in rational goodness and evil (al-husn wa l-qubh al-'Aqliyyayn) and any obligation for God, they regard imamate obligatory for people due to hadiths , not rationally obligatory. 'Adud al-Din al-Iji believes that 'Asharites consider appointment of Imam obligatory according to hadiths meaning that existence and appointment of Imam is necessary because God has said so, not because our intellect has concluded it. [24] Mu'tazilites , Maturidites , Abadiyyas, and a group of Zaydis regarded imamate incumbent upon people. Some Mu'tazilites regarded the necessity of imam rational and some others considered it necessary due to hadiths. [25] Reasons of Necessity Uli l-Amr Verse “ O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority among you. ” — Quran 4:59 In this verse, God orders people to obey Uli l-Amr , thus, they need to exist in the first place so that people obey them. Al-Taftazani refers to this reason and says. \"the necessity of obedience from Uli l-Amr requires its actualization.\" Hadith Man Mat The Prophet (s) said, \"One who dies not knowing Imam of his time, dies the death of ignorance.\" Some Muslim theologians has interpreted this hadith as the reason for the necessity of imamate, since according to this hadith, knowing Imam at any time is a religious duty and requires constant existence of Imam. Tradition of Muslims Some theologians have regarded the tradition of Muslims as the reason for necessity of imamate since it can be understood from the tradition of Muslims that they have considered the necessity of imamate a certain and unshakable issue. The disagreement between Shi'a and Sunnis has been actually over the case of imamate, not its principle. Abu 'Ali and Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i and some others have referred to the consensus of the companions on necessity of imamate. Qa'idat al-Lutf (Principle of Grace) The most important rational reason theologians bring for necessity of Imamate is the principle of grace. Shi'a theologians consider Imamate a clear example of the principle of grace and have said that God should be kind to His servants and appointing and introducing Imam is an act of grace, thus imamate is incumbent upon God. To explain that imamate is an act of grace, al-Sharif al-Murtada said, \"We know that human beings have rational duties and we know that the duty-bound (Mukallaf) are not infallible . Therefore, the reason for necessity of imamate is that any intelligent person who is familiar with the common sense and the tradition of the wise would know that whenever there is a competent and wise leader in a society who stand against tyranny and evil and defends justice and human values, social situation will be readier for development of virtues and values and this nothing but God's grace, since grace is what causes the duty-bound turn to obedience and virtues and turn away from vices and evil. Therefore, imamate is an act of grace towards the duty-bound.\" Theologians such as Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani , Sadid al-Din al-Himsi , Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , and others have had different explanations for imamate and its necessity with regards to the mentioned principle [of grace]. Even though Mu'tazilite theologians have accepted the principle of grace, they do not accept its effect on this issue and that imamate is an act of grace and have mentioned some criticisms which al-Sharif al-Murtada have answered to in al-Shafi fi l-imama . Philosophy Since Sunnis consider imam only a political leader of the society, they mention establishment of a government, performance of ordinary responsibilities of the government and management of the society as the philosophy for the existence of imam. For example, from Mu'tazilite viewpoint, performing religious rulings, guarding the existence of the Islamic society, preparing and mobilizing soldiers to fight with the enemy and such affairs are included in responsibilities of the Imam. However, Twelver Shi'a have stated two kind of goals for the existence of Imam. The first kind are the same practical goals and benefits Sunnis have mentioned. Accordingly, preserving the Muslims' social system, establishing social justice, Islamic rulings especially those with collective aspects and performing religious punishments have been mentioned among the goals of imamate. However, another area which covers the most important goals of imamate include: delivering, preserving and explaining religion. Delivering Religion From the Twelver Shi'a viewpoint, God has revealed religion to the Prophet (s) in complete form and the Prophet (s) has delivered it to Imams (a) in complete form so that they gradually explain all the rulings to people. Accordingly, details of the rulings related to worship, contracts, unilateral deals, heritage, punishments, blood-money are not mentioned in the Qur'an and the conduct of the Prophet (s). What is mentioned is the general aspects of these rulings. The rulings we have received through hadiths of the Prophet (s) are limited and not all of them are authentic regarding their references. Therefore, to compensate for this deficiency, Sunnis have had to use means such as qiyas (deduction by analogy), istihsan (judicial preference) and other sources which do not bring about certitude. Qiyas, istihsan and other non-certain methods are regarded invalid by Shi'a, since we do not have any authentic rational or legitimate proof according to which such methods can be used in the process of judgment. For example, fasting the last day of the month of Ramadan is obligatory , the first day of Shawwal forbidden and the second day of Shawwal is recommended while these days are the same apparently. Therefore, just based on their similarity, one cannot extend the ruling for one to another. From Shi'a viewpoint, the Prophet (s) has delivered Islam fully and there has not been any deficiency in it to be compensated by qiyas or istihsan. However, due to people's lack of maturity and lack of many issues at that time, many rulings would not be applied to common people at that time. The Prophet (s) taught these rulings to Imams after himself so that they later explain them to people. Guarding Religion Another criterion which necessitates the existence of imam and is mentioned among philosophies of the existence of imam is guarding religion. Accordingly, existence of imam helps religion to be saved from alterations, because the Qur'an has neither explained the details of rulings, nor does it speak by itself and needs interpretation. However since people's understanding of the Qur'an would be wrong, there is a need for those whose understanding of the Qur'an would be free from error or alteration. Their existence is a standard for recognizing others' misunderstandings and it would be what guards religion. Moreover, rulings and teachings which have been narrated as agreed by consensus or by many people are few and do not cover all the rulings of religion. Also, consensus alone, without referring to the ideas of the Infallible (a) is invalid. Therefore, the only way left is that religion would be guarded by an infallible imams (a) , because then his opinion is all right due to his infallibility and through which other opinions interpreting the Qur'an and explaining religion can be evaluated. Explaining Religious Teachings Among other factors which necessitate the existence of Imam is explanation of those religious rulings and teachings which have not been explained by the Prophet (s) due to lack of time and appropriate situation and they have been left to imam for explanation. Attributes and Requirements Infallibility One of the conditions and requirements of imamate is his immaculacy from sins and error in carrying out his duties and mission. The reason for it is that imam is the successor of the Prophet (s) and the reference in religious rulings and teachings, the Qur'an and the conduct of the Prophet (s). Therefore, he needs to be immaculate from sins and errors so that people can trust on him and his words. Otherwise, people's trust would be lost and God's goal from appointment of imams would be found meaningless. God-given Knowledge Infallible imams (s) had some other knowledge beside those they had heard directly or indirectly from the Prophet (s). That knowledge is among extraordinary knowledge which they have been given through inspiration and intuition such as those given to Khidr (a) , Dhu l-Qarnayn , lady Mary (a) and mother of Moses (a) . It was having such a knowledge that made some Imams (a) reach imamate in young ages. Thanks to this knowledge, they were aware about anything they needed for the guidance of people and carrying out their duties and did not need to learn them from others. Wilaya Wilaya is a closeness to God which brings about a certain power of influence for the closed one. This Wilaya has two types: in creation and in religion. Wilaya in creation or Wilaya over creation is Imam's guardianship over creatures of the world and influencing on them. The other type is Wilaya in religion which includes Imam's guardianship in interpretation and explanation of the Qur'an , the conduct of the Prophet (s) and leadership of the society. Authoritaty and Necessity of Obedience It means that Imam's words and his interpretation of God's word is authoritative and necessary to be obeyed. This attribute is the result of benefiting from God-given knowledge and knowing God's intention in verses of Divine Books. Imams (a) of Shi'a Imams of Shi'a are twelve people from the progeny of the Prophet (s) who are intellectual, spiritual and political leaders of Shi'a. The first one of whom was Imam 'Ali (a) and the rest are Imam 'Ali (a) and Lady Fatima's (a) children and grandchildren. According to Shi'a beliefs, after the Prophet (s), leadership of the Islamic society would always be upon Imams (a) who have been appointed by God. These Imams (a) have God-given knowledge, infallibility and the rights of intercession and by making Tawassul to them, one can become close to God. In addition to authority in religious teachings, these twelve Imams (a) have political leadership of the society as well. There are many hadiths from the Prophet (s) which have described their attributes and mentioned their names and show that all of them are from Quraysh and among the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) and the Promised Mahdi (a) is the last one of them. There are clear hadiths from the Prophet (s) about imamate of Imam 'Ali (a), the first Imam. Also, there are definite hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) about the imamate of the second Imam and respectively Imams (a) have clearly mentioned the Imams after them. According to these hadiths, Imams (a) are 12 and their names are: 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) Hasan b. 'Ali (a) Husayn b. 'Ali (a) 'Ali b. Husayn (a) Muhammad b. 'Ali (a) Ja'far b. Muhammad (a) Musa b. Ja'far (a) 'Ali b. Musa (a) Muhammad b. 'Ali (a) 'Ali b. Muhammad (a) Hasan b. 'Ali (a) Mahdi (a) Incompatibility with Khatamiyya As it was mentioned, imamate is among challenging doctrines which has been the center for many arguments since early Islam. One of the questions mentioned about it is that imamate as explained above and Shi'a believe in is incompatible with Khatamiyyat (the End of Prophethood); since, the person qualified for imamate as Shi'a believe in has no difference with the Prophet (s). Ayatollah Ja'far Subhani answered this question as below: \"The difference between prophethood and explanation of the knowledge of the Holy Prophet (s) is obvious and does not need much explanation; as prophethood means that the Prophet (s) receives revelation , hears God's word, sees His messenger and either delivers an independent religion or preaches the religion before himself. But Imam is the keeper of the knowledge of the Prophet (s) in whatever people need without being addressed by revelation, without hearing God's word or seeing the angel carrying the message.\" Moreover, some others believe that imamate as defined above is only a result of Shi'a's exaggeration and has not been existed in early authentic Islamic texts and beliefs of the Shi'a in the first centuries.

{"title": "Infallibility", "text": " ʿIṣma or Infallibility (Arabic: العِصمَة ) means abstinence from sins and from disobedience to God . The belief in the infallibility of the prophets and Imams , from intentional or unintentional sins, is a part of Shi'a creed. Infallibility from making mistakes in daily life issues –in addition to religious issues- is a matter of disagreement among scholars. Belief in the legitimacy of any religion and following its teachings precedes the substantiation of the infallibility of its prophet. In intra-faith discussions, the infallibility of the prophets (a) in receiving and conveying the divine revelation is demonstrated through rational arguments. However, infallibility in other practical aspects of their lives is mostly demonstrated through arguments driven by authoritative texts. Analysis of the Concept Literal Meaning The word 'isma ( عصمة ) literally means immunity; , however, it has been used in different meanings such as: chastity , preventing oneself from sins, the means for abstinence or immunity . Technical Meaning Muslim intellectuals and scholars have presented different definitions for infallibility ('isma). The most famous of which is the definition which connects 'isma to the divine benevolence ( luṭf ). According to this explanation, God grants 'isma to some human beings, thereupon, they will be immune to committing sins or disregarding obligations, while they have the freewill and capability of committing sins. Ash'ari viewpoint: Ash'ari theologians, because they believed in predestination (jabr) –that Human beings have no freewill (ikhtiyar) in their actions and behavior- have defined infallibility as the state in which the sins are not created by God in one particular human being. [5] Imamiyya and Mu'tazila viewpoint: Imamiyya and Mu'tazila theologians, based on their belief that the inherent good and evil (Ḥusn va Qubḥ) of things are known by reason and the principle of benevolence ( Qa'ida al-Luṭf ), have defined 'isma as deliberate abstinence from committing sins, because of divine benevolence bestowed upon one particular person. [6] Al-'Allama al-Hilli defines 'isma as a hidden kindness of God for His servant, which leaves no motivation in the servant for disregarding obligations or committing sins, while he/she is capable of both. [7] Although this state seems similar to the state of piety (taqwa), it is much higher than taqwa, to the level that it prevents the person from committing any indecent act even as a thought [8] and gains the person the highest levels of people's trust. [9] Origin of Infallibility Most scholars and thinkers have pointed to the existence of general capability and freewill for abstinence from sins in the infallible person. Thereof, a question arises: what causes the infallible to deliberately abstain from committing sins or be far from mistakes and negligence? Simply put, what is the origin of 'isma? In response to this question, several opinions have been put forth: The four means of divine benevolence : a group of theologians who have interpreted 'isma as a kind of divine benevolence ( luṭf ), believe the combination of four elements constitutes the basis of this divine kindness: The infallible person has certain physical and spiritual features and characteristics which enable him to abstain from the sins. The infallible person has complete awareness of the burdensome consequences of sins and the value of God's obedience. With continued divine revelation or inspiration, this awareness expands and becomes more profound. Not only because of disregarding obligations, the infallible will also be questioned about disregarding the recommended priorities; therefore, he knows there's no negligence or leniency about his actions and behavior (because of the heavy responsibility he bears). [10] Knowledge and Awareness of the Consequences of Sins : some believe that infallibility originated from a kind of intuitive knowledge about the reality of sin and its burdensome consequences and the reality of acts of obedience and their pleasant results. This knowledge is so strong that the infallible vividly sees these realities and consequences; therefore, he or she never even thinks about committing sins or disregarding divine obligations. [11] Freewill and Choice : another theory about the origin of 'isma identifies it with some kind of strong and internalized piety. This internalization is the result of repeating good deeds and continued abstinence from sins. However, this internalization is much more intensified in the state of 'isma, in comparison to the general state of piety. Repetition of correct actions requires freewill and determination, therefore, the main element in possessing the state of 'isma originates from the choice and freewill of the infallible. According to this theory, even the aforementioned intuitive knowledge about the realities of different actions and the ugliness of sin is a result of this strong will and determination by the infallible. [12] Knowledge and Will : some Muslim thinkers identify the basis of 'isma in two elements: knowledge of the facts about perfection, and strong will in acquiring perfection. For in the case of ignorance, man does not know the difference between real or delusional perfection, and in the case of weak will, man will be controlled by his selfish and carnal desires and will not reach real perfection. [13] A combination of natural, personal, and divine elements : some contemporary thinkers believe that 'isma does not have a single cause, rather it is the result of the combination of different elements, natural element (that is: genetic endowment, environment and family), personal element (that is: consciousness and awareness, will power and choice, intellect, and internalized virtues) and the divine element which is the special divine grace for the person. [14] Infallibility of the Prophets Range The discussion about the infallibility of the prophets expands to different degrees and levels and at each level, various debates have taken place among thinkers and theologians. These discussions range from immunity from polytheism and disbelief ( Kufr ) to immunity from normal mistakes. Immunity from polytheism and disbelief : there is no disagreement among different Islamic denominations and theologians about the infallibility of the Prophets from polytheism and disbelief (Kufr). All Muslims believe that all the prophets, whether before their prophethood or after it, did not commit any form of polytheism and disbelief. [15] Infallibility in receiving, preserving and conveying the divine revelation : main figures among Shi'a and Sunni theologians believe that the prophets are immune from sin, deliberate dishonesty [16] or mistake [17] , in the process of receiving, preserving and conveying the divine revelation . Upon this level of infallibility, divine prophets declare to people what has been revealed to them, without any change or alteration. Out of Divine wisdom, God chooses a person for this mission who would not commit any form of dishonesty. Infallibility in following religious practical laws : according to the famous view among Shi'a theologians, prophets are immune from deliberate sins or accidental mistakes in practicing religious obligations or avoiding religious prohibitions. [18] Infallibility in specifying cases of different practical laws : the subject of religious practical law is the action about which a certain religious ruling has been issued. Like prayers that has been made obligatory, and backbiting that has been prohibited. What is meant in this level of 'isma is that prophets do not commit deliberate dishonesty in recognizing the subjects, but what about accidental mistakes? For instance, is it possible for a prophet to mistakenly miss one of his prayers? Shi'a and Sunni theologians disagree over the extension of infallibility to this level. Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite thinkers believe the Prophets can make mistakes in recognizing the subjects of religious practical laws or in their application. Among Imamiyya theologians too, al-Shaykh al-Saduq believes there's no infallibility at this level and regards the belief in prophet's Immunity from mistakes and Sahw (general negligence), as an exaggerative belief that is advocated by Ghulat and Mufawwida ; however the common view among Shi'a theologians is the existence of infallibility at this level. Infallibility from mistakes in usual daily affairs : in this context, \"daily affairs\" are cases which, have no connection to religion per se and there is no religious law –whether obligation or prohibition- concerning them. Except for a case where such mistakes lead to public distrust, there's no rational argument in favor of the infallibility of the prophets from all mistakes in daily affairs; actually, historical reports are found in traditional collections that narrate such mistakes in the lives of the prophets. Necessity Considering the extent of the infallibility of the prophets, the necessity of each level can be explained. The Infallibility pertaining to the process of revelation (receiving, preserving, and conveying the revelation) is essential for the main mission of a prophet, which is conveying the divine message to the public, which must be guaranteed and preserved from any deliberate or accidental change and alteration. Revelation has its proper function only when it is preserved and protected from any deliberate or accidental error and distortion, from the moment it is issued, till the moment it is declared to people. Otherwise, people lose their trust and God's purpose of sending messengers and establishing religions will remain unfulfilled. Similarly, the infallibility in other areas is to guarantee the general reliability of the prophets. The absence of such reliability results in general distrust toward the main divine message and the goal of sending messengers will be ruined. Proofs Muslim thinkers have different opinions regarding the proofs of the infallibility of the prophets. An essential aspect of this discussion is that each level of 'isma requires its specific reason. On certain levels, infallibility can be demonstrated through rational arguments –as mentioned above- on some other levels, it only can be inferred from authoritative texts (verses of the Holy Qur'an or Hadith ). Therefore, the proof for each level must be discussed separately. Infallibility concerning polytheism and disbelief even before prophethood: The argument for this degree of infallibility is that a prophet's words and claims can be trusted only if they were not polytheists or unbelievers even before their prophethood. Infallibility in receiving and conveying the revelations: This degree of infallibility is demonstrated by rational arguments, because even if there is a possibility of mistakes in receiving and conveying the revelations, then that will defeat God's purpose from sending prophets, and it is not possible for God to defeat His purpose. The Qur'an says in this regard: al-Haqqa 44-47. Infallibility in the detection of jurisprudential rulings: The argument for this is that rational persons do not trust someone who even makes unintentional mistakes; for example, they do not trust such people with their possessions and money. So, how can they trust such a person and receive their religious rulings from him? Infallibility concerning ordinary affairs: if the mistakes at this level are not to the extent that leads to people's distrust of the prophet, then there is no rational or transmission-based argument for the impossibility of such mistakes, and if such mistakes are to the extent that leads to people's distrust, then the above rational argument will apply here as well. Infallibility of the Imams Necessity Since Imam is the successor of the Prophet (s) and the authoritative source of religious knowledge, including practical laws, spiritual teachings of the religion, exegeses of the Qur'an , and Sunna of the Prophet (s), he must be immune from mistakes or sins so that people can trust him and his words. Otherwise, people would lose their trust in him and God's purpose in appointing an Imam for guidance will not be fulfilled. Extent The infallibility of the Imams includes two main areas: Practice and Knowledge 1- Infallibility in Practice: this includes Imam's actions and behavior and has two levels: a. The infallible never disregards an obligation, nor commits a prohibited action b. The infallible never disregards a recommendation nor commits a reprehensible action 2- Infallibility in Knowledge: this includes the knowledge of issues related to his duty as an Imam and it has three levels: a. He does not make mistakes in religious knowledge, for he is the guide of people. b. He is infallible in his social and political decisions. Also, his decisions in scholarly leadership are perfect and correct. c. He is infallible in the application of religious practical laws and does not make mistakes in this regard. For instance, in discerning whether a given liquid is water or wine, he does not make a mistake. Arguments Rational Arguments Infinite Regress: according to this argument, the existence of the Imam originates from divine benevolence; he is the guide to whom people refer to recognize the right path. If the Imam is not infallible and possibly makes errors, there must be another Imam to correct him, and if the chain does not end in an infallible person, the probability of mistake and error remains. [25] Preserving the religion and presenting its correct interpretation: this argument comprises several premises: Following Imam's order is obligatory upon Muslims. If the Imam is not infallible and orders Muslims to commit sins, they are left with two options: (neither is possible) neither of the above is possible, so Imam must be infallible. Arguments based on Authoritative Texts Holy Qur'an The Verse about the Trial of Ibrahim \"And when his Lord tested Ibrahim with certain words, and he fulfilled them, He said, 'I am making you the Imam of mankind.' Said he (Ibrahim), 'And from among my descendants?' He said, 'My pledge does not extend to the unjust.'\" (Qur'an 2:124) This verse relates to the time when Prophet Ibrahim (a) had fulfilled the divine tests successfully. In addition to his previous position as an Ulu l-'Azm Prophet , upon the fulfillment of these tests, he reached the position of Imama. The argument of Imamiyya theologians and interpreters is as follows: Whoever commits sins is an unjust person, for he has transgressed the bounds of God (disregarded religious laws): ... and whoever transgresses the bounds of Allah, it is they who are unjust. (Qur'an 2:229) an unjust person cannot be in the position of Imama: My pledge does not extend to the unjust. (Qur'an 2:124) in the context of the verse, injustice includes all forms of injustice, whether about oneself or others or injustice in issues pertaining to the divine law, it also includes those who have committed injustice only once in their lives. Hereupon, a person who is not infallible has committed injustice, and an unjust person cannot reach the position of Imama. [29] Uli l-Amr Verse \"O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority among you.\" (Qur'an 4:59) The argument based on this verse has two premises: 1- The conjunction used between the word 'Rasul' (Apostle) and the word 'Uli l-Amr' (those vested with authority) is 'waw' (Arabic: واو , and) which indicates that the obedience to Uli l-Amr -like the obedience to the Apostle- is unconditional. 2- Whenever God obligates unconditional obedience to a particular person, it postulates the infallibility of that person. For if that person is not infallible, he might issue wrong orders, in that case, people must both obey and refuse his command. They must obey him because God has made obligatory the absolute obedience to the Uli l-Amr; similarly, they must refuse because, according to the famous and Mutawatir narration from the Prophet (s), \"there's no obedience to the created (when it results) in disobedience to the Creator.\" Tathir Verse \"Indeed Allah desires to repel all impurity only from you, O Ahl al-Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification.\" (Qur'an 33:33) The argument based on this verse consists of six premises: God has willed to purify only the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , The Tashri'i divine will for purification is general, not particular, The divine will in the verse cannot be a Tshri'i divine will, since the will in the verse is restricted to one particular group, i.e. the Ahl al-Bayt (a) therefore it is a Takwini divine will , The Takwini divine will is inevitably fulfilled, The purification is stressed and unconditional, which means all sorts of impurities are repelled, Except for Shi'a, none of the other Muslim sects have ever claimed the infallibility of their leaders, in fact, there's no historical evidence that anyone has ever claimed to be the addressee of this verse, or used the title \"Ahl al-Bayt\" except for Lady Fatima al-Zahra (a) , her husband, Imam Ali (a) and their children. So Ahl al-Bayt (a) containing Imam 'Ali (a), Lady Fatima (a), Imam al-Hasan (a) , and Imam al-Husayn (a) and other Shi'a Imams are infallible. Hadith Hadith al-Thaqalayn The Holy Prophet (s) said: \"I have left among you two things, you will never go astray after me, should you hold onto them. These are two weighty things, the one which is greater than the other, is the Book of Allah , an extended rope from heaven to earth and my 'Itra, Ahl al-Bayt (household), be aware that they will not separate till the time they meet me near the al-Hawdh (pond).\" This Hadith proves the infallibility of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) from different perspectives: According to this narration, the Prophet (s) directs all Muslims to have unconditional obedience to the Holy Qur'an and his household. Unconditional obedience postulates infallibility, for it is impossible for God and his Apostle to introduce a fallible person, who might make mistakes and contradict the Holy Qur'an and the Sunna of the Prophet (s), as the guide for people. In this narration the inseparability between the Qur'an and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) has been emphasized. Committing a sin or making a mistake means separation from the Qur'an, while the Prophet (s) has confirmed the inseparable bond between the two, until the Day of Judgment . - In this Hadith, the Holy Qur'an and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are introduced as the guides who save their followers from deviation; this function is only possible when the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are infallible and immune from sins and mistakes. \"Ali is with the truth and truth is with Ali\" 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Sa'd has narrated from his father: we were sitting in a group of Muhajirun and Ansar near the house of the Prophet (s) when Ali (a) came. The Apostle of God (s) asked: do you want me to introduce to you the best among you? \"Yes,\" they replied. The Prophet (s) said: 'The best among you are those who keep their covenant and use perfume. God likes the pious servants.' At this very moment Ali b. Abi Talib (a) passed by us, the Apostle of God (s) said: he is with the truth and truth is with him. This Hadith is explicitly stating the infallibility of Imam Ali (a) , for infallibility means nothing but the continual companionship with the truth and righteousness, and immunity from mistakes and sins in words and deeds. The Apostle of God (s) testifies that Imam Ali (a) is always and in all situations with the truth and never separates from the truth. With this testimony, the absolute infallibility of Imam Ali (a) from any sin or mistake is demonstrated, for the actions and words of a fallible person are not always associated with the truth. So the belief in the infallibility of Imam Ali (a) is necessary; otherwise, it entails the rejection of the testimony of the Prophet of Islam (s). Narration about Imam Ali (a) and the Imams of his progeny The Prophet of Islam (s) said: whoever wishes to look at the red ruby stick which God has planted with His hands and hold onto it, he should have the Wilaya of 'Ali and the Imams from his progeny, for they are the chosen ones by God and the pure ones and the infallible from all sins and mistakes. This Hadith explicitly states the infallibility of Shi'a Imams. Infallibility of Angels ... over which (fire) are [assigned] angels, severe and mighty, who do not disobey whatever God has commanded them, and carry out what they are commanded. Holy Qur'an: 66:6 Angels are beings that are pure from any form of disobedience and sin . However, based on the general definition of 'isma, the term is accurately used for beings that have freewill and the ability to disobey God's commands, but refrain from committing sins, and are supported by the divine benevolence, they are immune to mistakes which entail mistrust. According to this definition, while angels are pure from disobedience, they do not have the position of 'isma in the proper sense of the term. However in the extended application of the term, i.e. purity from sins and mistakes (whether out of freewill or by nature) angels are infallible as well since they do not tend sins. They are engaged in everlasting glorification and praise of God and always obey divine commands.

{"title": "Legislative Guardianship", "text": "Al-Wilāyat al-tashrīʿīyya (Arabic: الولاية التَشريعِيَّة , lit: legislative authority or guardianship) refers to the power to enact religious rulings. According to the doctrine of legislative guardianship, God has granted the Prophet (s) and Imams of the Shi'a (a) the authority to legislate on their own. However, there is disagreement among Shi'a scholars regarding this doctrine, with some accepting it and others rejecting it. Those who reject it believe that legislation is an exclusive authority of God. In hadith sources, the concept of legislative guardianship is referred to as the \"delegation of religious affairs to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a).\" Legislative guardianship is used in another sense, which is endorsed by all Shi'a scholars. In this sense, the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) have authority over people’s lives and property, and their words must be obeyed. Two Senses of Legislative Guardianship Shi'a scholars use the term \"legislative guardianship\" in two distinct senses. The first sense pertains to the legislative right over people's lives and property. In this context, it means that God has granted the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) the authority to make decisions regarding the lives and property of people. For example, they may sell property as they see fit, and their decisions must be obeyed by the people. The second sense of legislative guardianship pertains to religious legislation. This means that the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) have the authority to enact religious rulings related to various aspects of life, such as acts of worship, economics, politics, judiciary, and more. In essence, they have the right to issue religious rulings that determine whether something is halal or haram . This concept is referred to as \"God's delegation of religious affairs to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a).\" The Controversial Problem in Legislative Guardianship All Shi'a scholars accept the first sense of legislative guardianship regarding the Prophet (s) and Imams (a). This means that they agree that the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) have authority over the lives and property of the people, and that all worldly and hereafter affairs of the people are under their administration. As such, they must be obeyed in all these affairs. It is the second sense of legislative guardianship that is controversial among Shi'a scholars. The question that arises is whether anyone, including the Prophet (s) and Imams (a), aside from God, has the right to legislate. The debate centers around whether God has delegated the legislative right in religious affairs to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) or not. Opponents and Proponents of Legislative Guardianship (in the Sense of Delegation) According to some Shi'a scholars, such as Ja'far Subhani and Safi Gulpayigani , no human being, including the Prophet (s) and Imams (a), has the right to legislate in Islam. They believe that this right is exclusive to God, who has not delegated it to anyone else. However, legislative guardianship is acceptable in limited cases as specified in hadiths, where God has allowed only the Prophet (s) to legislate. For example, according to a hadith, God had obliged daily prayers as two-rak'a prayers, but the Prophet added two rak'as to the noon , afternoon , and 'isha' prayers , and one rak'a to the evening prayer , and God approved his legislation. In contrast, scholars such as Gharawi Isfahani , Sayyid Ja'far Murtada 'Amili , and Husayni Tihrani believe that the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) have legislative authority over all religious affairs. Evidence adduced by the Opponents Some of the opponents of the delegation of religious affairs to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) have adduced the following pieces of evidence: The Quranic verse: \"Judgement belongs only to Allah.\" [11] The Quranic verse: \"Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down it is they who are the faithless.\" [12] The Verse: \"So judge between them by what Allah has sent down.\" [13] Imam al-Baqir (a) : \"There are two types of judgment: judgment of God and judgment of the ignorant (jahilis).\" [14] Evidence adduced by the Proponents Proponents of the legislative guardianship make recourse to hadiths in which religious affairs are said to have been delegated to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a). Sayyid Ja'far Murtada al-'Amili believes that these hadiths are frequently transmitted . The following are examples of such hadiths. Imam al-Sadiq (a) : God trained His apostle with His love and then said, \"and indeed you possess a great character.\" And then delegated the affair to him and said, \"he who obeys God’s apostle has obeyed God.\" The Prophet (s) then delegated the affair to 'Ali (a) and entrusted him. We (Imams of the Shi'a) are the intermediaries between you and God the Glorious. God has established no good for anyone in disobeying us. [16] Imam al-Sadiq (a): God the Glorious trained His apostle well, and having perfected his manners, God told him: \"and indeed you possess a great character.\" He then delegated the affairs of religion and ummah to him to administer His servants.\" [17] The Delegation in Sources of Hadiths In some sources of hadiths , certain sections are dedicated to the issue of delegation of religious affairs to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a). A case in point is al-Kulayni ’s al-Kafi , which involves a section on the \"delegation of the affair of religion to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a),\" in which ten relevant hadiths are cited. Moreover, two sections of al-Saffar al-Qummi ’s Basa'ir al-darajat are dedicated to this issue. Some scholars believe that delegation of religious affairs to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) amounts to legislative guardianship or the authority to make religious legislations. However, others interpret it as elaboration of the details of certain rulings that were already legislated by God and revealed to the Prophet (s).

{"title": "Major Occultation", "text": "The Major Occultation (Arabic: الغَيبَة الکُبرى ) is a term for the period of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) hidden life after the Minor Occultation . This period started from 329 /941 and continues until today. In this period, Shi'as are not in direct contact with the Imam (a). Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a) The disappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , the last and twelfth Shi'a Imam , is called the occultation of Imam Mahdi (a). According to Shi'a teachings, Imam al-Mahdi (a) has had two occultations: The Minor Occultation , which lasted sixty nine lunar years , and the Major Occultation, which continues to the present day. During the Minor Occultation, Imam al-Mahdi (a) communicated with the Shi'a through the four deputies , but during the Major Occultation this communication does not exits and the Shi'a must refer to the scholars for their religious needs. The Beginning of the Major Occultation From the beginning of his imamate in 260 /874, Imam al-Mahdi (a) limited his contacts with the Shi'a to the relations through his specific deputies , the last of whom was 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri who passed away in Sha'ban 15 , 329 / May 15 , 941 . He received the following letter from the Imam (a), one week before his death: \"O 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri! May God reward your brothers for [being patient about] your loss, because you will pass away after six days. So prepare yourself, and do not designate anyone as your successor after your death, because the absolute occultation has occurred. There will be no appearance until God gives permission, and that will be after a long time when the hearts are hardened and the world is filled with injustice. Some of my followers will claim to have seen me, but know that whoever claims to have seen me before the uprising of the al-Sufyani and the heavenly cry he is indeed a liar and a slanderer.\" In this way, after the demise of al-Samuri, contacts with the Imam (a) through specific deputies ended and a new phase of occultation started, which was called the Major Occultation in later sources. Most Shi'a sources mention 329/941 as the year in which the fourth deputy passed away, but al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Fadl b. al-Hasan al-Tabrisi have recorded the year 328 /940. The Role of the Imam in the Period of the Major Occultation According to Shi'i beliefs, although Imam Mahdi (a) is in occultation, the world is receiving the blessings of his existence. The world needs the Imam (a) as the Proof of God for the continuation of its being. The Imam (a) not only has legislative wilaya but also generative wilaya over the world. As 'Allama Tabataba'i explains, the Imam's tasks are not limited to interpreting Islamic teachings and instructing people, but more importantly include his spiritual guardianship (wilaya), that is, leading the people and their deeds towards God , for which task physical presence or absence is irrelevant. Meeting with the Imam During Major Occultation Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of the Major Occultation has been a challenging issue for Shi'a scholars. Some scholars, such as Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Nu'mani , al-Shaykh al-Mufid , Fayd Kashani and Kashif al-Ghita' believe that it is impossible to meet the Imam (a) during the Major Occultation. The most important evidence in this regard is the last letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to his Fourth Deputy according to which whoever claims to have met the Imam (a) is called a liar. Yet the interpretation of this letter has been a matter of discussion among the Shi'a , and there have been different viewpoints among them as to the possibility of meeting the Imam (a) during this occultation. Some people believe that this letter is restricted to those who claim that they met the Imam (a) along with being his deputy or representative. Therefore, a group of scholars such as al-Sharif al-Murtada , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , Muhammad b. 'Ali al-Karajuki and Mirza Husayn Nuri have considered meeting Imam al-Mahdi (a) to be possible during Major Occultation. Many Shiite scholars have also talked about their meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. Those Who Have Allegedly Met the Imam In different Shi'i sources, several stories have been recorded regarding the people who have been able to meet the Imam (a) in the period of the Major Occultation. Some of the most well-known stories include the stories of the meeting of al-'Allama al-Hilli , Bahr al-'Ulum , Isma'il Hirqali, Haj 'Ali al-Baghdadi , and 'Ali b. Ibrahim b. Mahziyar . These stories are narrated in Bihar al-anwar and Mafatih al-jinan and works like al-Najm al-thaqib . General Deputyship During Major Occultation After the demise of the fourth specific deputy in 329/941, Imam al-Mahdi (a) did not appoint any other specific deputies. In this way, all direct contacts between the Imam (a) and the people were cut. According to hadiths related to the occultation--including the one in which the Imam (a) refers people to religious scholars with regard to worldly and religious matters--religious scholars and jurists are generally introduced as the deputies of the Imam (a) in this period.

{"title": "Muftarad al-Ta'a", "text": "Muftaraḍ al-Ṭāʿa (Arabic: مُفْتَرَضُ الطاعَة ), a special status for the Imams of the Shi'a (a) , means someone towards whom full and unconditional obedience is compulsory . Citing some Qur'anic verses and Hadiths , like Ulu l-Amr verse , Hadith al-Thaqalayn , Hadith al-Safina and Hadith al-Manzila , Shi'a scholars consider Shi'a Imams (a) as Individuals whose obedience is obligatory. Some of the scholars, like al-Shaykh al-Tusi , argues for this status for the Commander of the faithful (a) , and then takes it as the basis to argue for his Imamate . In addition to the abovementioned Hadiths, there are accounts in Shi'a Hadith sources that explicitly designate this title for the Imams (a). In al-Kafi , seventeenth Hadiths have been narrated in a specific chapter dedicated to this title. However, in some accounts the Imams (a) have not recognized themselves as Muftarad al-Ta'a; and given the apparent conflict between two groups of Hadith, Shi'a scholars have not accepted the latter. Some researchers suggest these accounts have been issued in the context of Taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation). Concept Muftarad al-Ta'a is title given to someone towards whom full and unconditional obedience is compulsory. Shi'a scholars consider it as a unique and special status for Imams (a). Al-Allama al-Majlisi regards being Muftarad al-Ta'a as one of requisite for the state of Imamate and believes the Hadith al-Manzila proves this point. Some also have stated that the meaning of Imamate and divine vicegerency is essentially this very state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a. Arguments for Imams’ status as Muftarad al-Ta'a Basing their argument on different Qur'anic verses and Hadiths, Shi'a scholars considers Imams (a) as those towards whom obedience is obligatory. The verse of Ulu l-Amr , Hadith of al-Thaqalayn, Hadith al-Safina and Hadith al-Manzila are among the Qur'anic verses and Hadiths through which the state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) can be demonstrated. Additionally, there are some Hadith accounts that directly and explicitly mention the title Muftarad al-Ta'a for the Imams (a): The Verse of Ulu l-Amr According to the verse \"Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those who hold command from among you.\" The obedience to Ulu l-Amr (those who hold command) -along with and like the obedience to Allah and His Apostle- has been regarded as an absolute and unconditional obligation. As 'Allama Tabataba'i states, immediate conjunction of Ulu l-Amr to the Apostle without independently repeating the verb \"obey\", shows that like the obedience to the Apostle, the obedience to Ulu l-Amr is unconditionally obligatory. Based on exegetical Hadiths, Shi'a scholars take Ulu l-Amr as a reference to Twelve Imams (a) . Implicit mention of Muftarad al-Ta'a in Hadiths In Hadith al-Thaqalayn , Ahl al-Bayt (a) have been conjoined together. As following the holey Qur'an is obligatory upon Muslims , obedience to Ahl al-Bayt (a) is likewise obligatory. According to Abu al-Salah al-Halabi , Shi'a jurist and theologian in fourth/fifth or tenth/eleventh century, the unrestricted verbal expression in the prophetic Hadith of al-Thaqalayn, proves the unrestricted and unconditional obligation in following the Ahl al-Bayt (a). Therefore, Muslims should follow the Ahl al-Bayt (a) in all of their verbal and practical teachings. Also, Hadith al-Safina proves the obligation of obedience and and following the Ahl al-Bayt (a); because, based on the content of this Hadith, salvation is achieved by following them and perdition and misguidance are the results of disobeying them. As Mir Hamid Husayn states, based on this Hadith, obedience to Ahl al-Bayt (a) is absolutely and unconditionally compulsory. Some of the scholars, like al-Shaykh al-Tusi and Abu al-Salah al-Halabi argue for the state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imam Ali (a) through the Hadith al-Manzila and from there, demonstrates his Imamate. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi writes: in Hadith al-Manzila, the Prophet (s) introduces the relation of Imam Ali (a) to himself like that of Harun (a) to Moses (a) . Since Harun was Muftarad al-Ta'a because of his vicegerency from Moses (a), Imam 'Ali (a) too is Muftarad al-Ta'a and this very status proves his Imamate as well. Explicit mention of Muftarad al-Ta'a in Hadiths There are accounts in Hadith sources that explicitly state that the Imams (a) are Muftarad al-Ta'a. In al-Kafi and under the chapter entitled \"The Chapter on the Obligation of Obedience to the Imams\" al-Kulayni has documented seventeenth Hadith in this regard. In one of these Hadiths, Imam al-Sadiq (a) testifies to the status of Muftarad al-Ta'a for his previous Imams (a) and introduces them as Imams (a), whose obedience Allah has made compulsory. In another Hadith, Imam al-Sadiq (a) swears that there is no status on earth, higher than being Muftarad al-Ta'a, and even though Prophet Ibrahim (a) had been receiving divine revelation for a long time, he had not been Muftarad al-Ta'a until Allah appointed him as an Imam. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi in Bihar al-Anwar has narrated from Imam al-Rida (a) that this status (for Imams) had been announced to Muslims during the lifetime of the Prophet (s) and the covenant was confirmed on the day of Ghadir . Additionally, there are accounts in Hadith sources that different individuals in different occasions, testify to the Imams’ state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a in their presence and the Imams (a) receive their testimony. Apposite Hadiths In Shi'a Hadith sources, accounts can be found where Imams (a) of the Shi'a have denied their being Muftarad al-Ta'a. One such Hadith has been narrated by al-Shaykh al-Tusi . In this Hadith, two individuals come to Imam al-Sadiq (a) and one of them asks him: \"is the Muftarad al-Ta'a leader from among you?\" and Imam (a) replies: \"I don't know such a person among us.\" Then that individual continues: \"some people in Kufa believe that the Muftarad al-Ta'a leader is from among you.\" Imam (a) says: \"we have not ordered them to do this.\" Also, in his book al-Ikhtisas , al-Shaykh al-Mufid has narrated a Hadith in which Imam al-Kazim (a) regards the belief in the status of Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) as one of the Ghali (exaggerators') beliefs and rejects it. Opinion of Shi'a sholars about opposite Hadiths Shia scholars do not accept the Hadiths against the status of Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) and believe that Imams (a) of the Shi'a are Muftarad al-Ta'a. Al-Shaykh al-Saduq , al-Shaykh al-Mufid and al-Shaykh al-Tusi believe that as per the content of Hadith al-Manzila , Imams (a) are Muftarad al-Ta'a. Some researchers state that the Hadiths in which the Imams (a) have negated the state of being Muftarad al-Ta'a form themselves have been issued in the context of Taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation). According to this viewpoint, during the time of Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Kazim (a) the belief in the state of Muftarad al-Ta'a for Imams (a) had gained prevalence which, subsequently, raised the sensitivity of Abbasid caliphs , for they would clearly see this belief as a threat to their totalitarian political authority.

{"title": "Minor Occultation", "text": " The Minor Occultation (Arabic: الغيبة الصغرى ) refers to the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) led a hidden life, but was in contact with his followers through the four deputies . This period started from 260 /874 and ended in 329 /941. Beginning of the Minor Occultation Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) had very limited interactions with his followers, because the 'Abbasid caliph , al-Mu'tamid , had restricted the Imam's (a) contacts and activities and kept him under severe surveillance. As a result, most Shiites were deprived of being directly in touch with the Imam (a) and could only contact him through a few select individuals. Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) was eventually martyred in 260 /874. According to the Imamiyya viewpoint, the last Imam is the Twelfth Imam (a). According to early Imamiyya sources, Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) did not appoint his son as his successor openly; rather, he introduced him secretly as the next Imam to some of his close companions. The reason for this was that al-Mu'tamid was looking for the Imam's son to arrest him, since he was aware of Shi'a beliefs about him and their anticipation for his uprising. In Imamiyya hadith sources, the names and testimonies of several Shi'as who saw the son of Imam al-'Askari (a) are recorded. According to a hadith, reported by Muhammad b. 'Uthman , the second deputy of the twelfth Imam (a), Imam al-'Askari (a) gathered forty of his trusted followers and showed them his son. After the martyrdom of Imam al-'Askari (a) in 260/874, his son Imam al-Mahdi (a) performed the funeral prayer of his father. The Minor Occultation started on that day and continued until 329 /941. The Most Important Reason for the Minor Occultation Because of the social and political restrictions and security threats that the Imams (a) were increasingly facing after the 'Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun , according to Shi'a hadith sources, the eleventh Imam (a) strived to protect his son, Imam al-Mahdi (a), after his birth. This is why he could not announce the news of his son's birth publicly and only informed some of his close companions, such as Abu Hashim al-Ja'fari and Ahmad b. Ishaq , and his sisters, Lady Hakima and Lady Khadija, of the birth of the Twelfth Imam (a). The Imam's (a) relation with the Shi'a The persecutions that the Imams (a) faced led them to adopt a new system for their relations with their followers. In this system, the relation between the Imams (a) and the Shi'a was basically established through a network of deputies and representatives. According to Shi'a sources, Imam al-Sadiq (a) was the first Imam who invented this secret system. Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) , too, used this system and was in contact with his followers through his deputies. The same system was used by the twelfth Imam (a), who was in contact with the Shi'a during the Minor Occultation through the Four Deputies. The Four Deputies According to Shi'i hadiths, in the period of the Minor Occultation, the Twelfth Imam (a) was in contact with his followers through four deputies called \"sufara'\" (ambassadors). The first of these deputies was 'Uthman b. Sa'id al-'Amri , the second was his son Muhammad , the third al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti , and the fourth 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri . The Most important duty of these deputies was fulfilling the tasks that were previously done by the Imams (a) themselves, so that the Imams be protected against the persecutions of the Abbasids . The Imams (a) were under these persecutions since the time of al-Ma'mun , and the Twelfth Imam (s) faced the threat of persecutions more, because the belief of the majority of the Imamiyya was that the Twelfth Imam would destroy the rule of the oppressors. While not revealing the name of the Imam (a) or his place of residence to anyone, the deputies had to be witnesses of the existence of the Imam (a) for his trusted followers. This can be inferred from a hadith quoted by al-Kulayni , according to which, one day, 'Abd Allah b. Ja'far al-Himyari asked the first deputy, 'Uthman b. Sa'id , whether he had seen the successor of the eleventh Imam (a). 'Uthman testified that he had seen him, but he added that people were prohibited from asking about his name, because if the government discovered his name, they would certainly try to detain the Imam (a). The first deputy was able to make the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tamid think that the eleventh Imam (a) had passed away without leaving behind any successors. According to a report by al-Kulayni , this saved the Imamiyya from the persecution that they had long suffered from. The activities of the deputies with regard to proving the imamate of the twelfth Imam (a) resulted also in protecting Imamiyya Shi'ism from further fragmentation. They cited the sayings of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) that indicated that the number of the Imams (a) would be twelve, and that the twelfth Imam (a) would go into an occultation. The End of the Minor Occultation According to the consensus of the Shi'a, after the demise of 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri , the fourth deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a), the period of direct deputyship came to an end, and there will be no specific deputies until the reappearance of the Imam (a) . Thus, with the demise of the fourth deputy, the Minor Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a), which took seventy years, came to an end and the period of the Major Occultation started.

{"title": "Mawadda of Ahl al-Bayt (a)", "text": "Mawadda (Arabic: مَوَدَّة ) is an Arabic word which means \"love\", adopted from Mawadda verse . This verse and some other narrations such as hadith Bab Hitta and also the conduct of the Prophet (s) indicate that loving the Ahl al-Bayt (a) is incumbent upon Muslims. In the Mawadda Verse “ قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it except love of [my] relatives.' ” — Q,42:23 In the verse of Mawadda, the love of the progeny of the Prophet (s) has been considered as the reward for his mission. \"Relatives\" in the verse refers to those about whom the Tathir verse was revealed. According to al-Hakim al-Nishaburi , after the martyrdom of 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , al-Hasan b. 'Ali (a) gave a speech for people and introduced himself and said: \"I am one of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) to whom Gabriel descended; and I am from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) God repelled from them any evil. And I am from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) God made their love incumbent upon every Muslim and said, \"Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it except love of [my] relatives.' Whoever performs a good deed, We shall enhance for him its goodness.\" (42:23) To do goodness is the love of us the Ahl a-Bayt (a).\" As al-Khwarazmi narrated from Ibn 'Abbas , when the al-Mawadda verse was revealed, some people told the Prophet (s), \"who are these relatives of yours, whose love has been incumbent upon us? The Prophet (s) answered, \"'Ali (a), Fatima (a) , and their two sons.\" In Hadiths Al-Tabari narrated from Abu Daylam that when 'Ali b. al-Husayn (a) was brought into Damascus as captive , a man from Syria stood up and, filled with jubilation, spoke boldly about the murdering of Imam al-Husayn (a) , his companions, and the capturing of his family and children. Imam al-Sajjad (a) told him, \"Have you ever recited the al-Mawadda verse?\" the man said, \"Does 'Qurba' (relatives) refer to you? Imam (a) answered, \"yes\". Ibn 'Asakir narrated from Imam al-Husayn (a) saying, \"the relationship God has counted great and has made observing it incumbent upon people and regarded as reward for the Prophet's (s) mission, is our relationship.\" The Shafi'i hadith scholar, al-Hafiz Abu 'Abd Allah al-Ganji narrated from al-Tabarani that the Prophet (s) said, \"God created prophets (s) from different trees (different origins) and created me and 'Ali (a) from one tree (origin). I am the root of that tree and 'Ali (a) is a branch of it, Fatima (a) is its conception and al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) are its fruits. Anyone who hangs on to one of them will survive and anyone who turns away from them will fall. And if a person worships three thousand years between Safa and Marwa , while not having our love, God will throw him in the hell.\" He (s) then recited the Mawadda verse. About the reference of the hadith , Abu Abd Allah Ganji said, \"this hadith is highly good.\" Abu Nu'yim al-Isfahani narrated from Zadhan that 'Ali (a) said, \"About us, the people of HaMim (two Suras of Qur'an begin with HaMim), it is set that our love will not be observed except by the faithful and then he (a) recited al-Mawadda verse.\" After narrating narrations about incumbency of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , Ibn Hajar al-Makki said, \"From aforementioned hadiths, the incumbency of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and absolute prohibition of having hatred towards them were understood. Al-Bayhaqi, al-Baghawi and others have asserted on the incumbency of the love of them. Al-Shafi'i has also expressed that in some poems narrated from him.\" After narrating the hadith Bab Hitta , he has said, \"the resemblance of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) to Bab Hitta (Hitta door) is that God made entering with humbleness while repenting through it, which was in Ariha, to Jerusalem, forgiving for Israelites and the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) a cause of forgiveness for the Islamic Umma .\" Conduct of the Prophet (s) Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , the great Shafi'i commentator and theologian of the 6th/12th century has justified the incumbency of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) in the following way, \"there is no doubt that the Prophet (s) , loved 'Ali (a) , Fatima (a) , al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) ; thus, this is incumbent upon all the Umma, since God has said, 'and follow him so that you may be guided.' (Quran 7:158) and he (s) also said, 'If you love God, follow me so that God loves you.' (Quran 3:31) And elsewhere the Qur'an also states, 'In the Apostle of Allah there is certainly for you a good exemplar,' (Quran 33:21).\" Al-Razi interpreted Al Muhammad (family of Muhamamd) as 'Ali (a), Fatima (a), al-Hasan (a) and al-Husayn (a) and said, \"family of Muhamamd are those who are relatives of the Prophet (s); therefore, anyone who has a stronger and more complete relationship with the Prophet (s) would be considered his family. And there is no doubt that Fatima (a), 'Ali (a), Hasan (a) and Husayn (a) had strongest attachment with the Prophet (s). Therefore, they (a) are family of the Prophet (s).\" He then brings a reference from a hadith narrated by Zamakhshari that when the Mawadda verse descended, people asked the Prophet (s), \"who are those relatives of yours, whose love is incumbent upon us?\" The Prophet (s) said, \"Ali (a), Fatima (a) and their two sons (a).\" Why the Prophet (s) Asked for a Reward Question: In different verses of the Qur'an , it is stressed that divine prophets (a) did not ask for a reward, and this is one of the characteristics of prophets (a). They emphasized that their reward is upon God and no one else (\"Surely, my reward is upon no one but God\", [11:29, 26:127, ...]). Thus, how can the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) be considered as the reward of Prophet's (s) mission? Answer: From related verses, it can be understood that the Prophet (s) did not ask any material or non-material reward from Muslims for himself, \"Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it, and I am no impostor.\" (38:86) and that he (s) asked the love of his Ahl al-Bayt (a) as the reward for his mission, it would be for their own benefit. \"Say, 'Whatever reward I may have asked you is for your own good. My [true] reward lies only with Allah.'\" (Quran 34:47) The reward the Prophet (s) asked people and is in fact for their own benefit is that they would accept his religion and act upon it, since his religion is the path to God and choosing the path to God is the cause of human's happiness. \"Say, 'I do not ask you any reward for it, except that anyone who wishes should take the way to his Lord.'\" (Quran 25:57) However, going on the way toward God requires knowing it which needs guides who know the way well and steadfast in passing through it. These guides are the infallible Ahl al-Bayt (s) of the Prophet (s). It is obvious that if anyone wants to fully benefit from their guidance, he would need to love them in advance, admires and dignifies them so that their personalities would be attractive to him. This is mentioned in the Mawadda verse. Notes References Events Books Related"}
{"title": "Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "The Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (Arabic: غيبة الإمام المهدي ) refers to the belief that the last and twelfth Shi'a Imam, Imam al-Mahdi (a) , was disappeared. The occultation was conducted at the permission and will of God and is one of the basic and mandatory teachings of the Twelver Shi'a sect. In Hadiths that have discussed the motives behind occultation, the idea of putting the Shi'a to test has been cited. According to Shi'a teachings, Imam al-Mahdi (a) has had two occultations: The Minor Occultation , which lasted sixty nine lunar years , and the Major Occultation , which continues to the present day. During the Minor Occultation, Imam al-Mahdi (a) communicated with the Shi'a through the four deputies , but during the Major Occultation this communication does not exist and the Shi'a must refer to the scholars for their religious needs. In order to explain occultation, Shi'a researchers have written numerous books on the issue, the most famous of which are al-Nu'mani's book on occultation ( Al-Ghayba ) and al-Shaykh al-Tusi 's Book on occultation ( Kitab al-Ghayba ). Defining the Topic According to Shi'a belief, God never leaves the earth without His deputy, the ultimatum, and infallible Imam. After the martyrdom of the eleventh Imam (a) in 260 /874, the twelfth Imam, Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-'Askari (a), who was born in 255 /869, inherited the position. By God's knowledge and will, the twelfth Imam disappeared from sight in 260 /874, although he is still alive and shall reappear one day to free the world from the violence and injustice that fills it, in order to place justice and fairness instead. Lexical Definition The word ghayba ( غَيْبَة , occultation) is derived from the root \"gh-y-b\" ( غ ی ب ). Its definition is opposite to presence and is used to convey disappearance from sight and camouflage . Minor Occultation The Minor Occultation is the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) was in occultation after his father's martyrdom, in 260/874, to 329/941. The Imam (a) helped his followers spiritually, and guided them through his deputies, who are called the Four Deputies . Major Occultation The Major Occultation is the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) went into the second phase of his occultation after the death of his fourth deputy, 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri . There is no interval between Minor Occultation and Major Occultation, and the only difference is that contrary to the period of Minor Occultation, in this period, Imam (a) has no specific deputy, and Shi'a people should refer to the scholars for their religious affairs. The Occultation is divided into two periods to show the lack of connection with Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the second period. According to Shi'a belief, although the Imam is in occultation, the world and those in it all benefit from the blessing of his existence. In other words, the world needs an Imam who has been chosen by God in order to exist. This Imam does not just hold the legislative wilaya (al-wilaya al-tashri'iyya) of this world, but also has the generative wilaya (al-wilaya al-takwiniyya) as well . Therefore, some of the dominant Shi'a sources have a chapter on انَّ الْأَئِمَّةَ هُمْ أَرْكَانُ الْأَرْضِ which means, the Imams are the pillars of earth . Representatives at the Age of Occultation According to Shi'a teachings, it is obligatory that God appoints an Imam. This belief results from two principles; Rational good and badness and the Principle of Grace . This is why the Imam , who has the duty to lead the worldly and religious lives of the human beings, must be chosen by God. At the era when the infallible and chosen Imam is not present in the community, the duty is put on the shoulders of the scholars whom have the conditions for this position to represent him. Leading the human race, according to the Shi'a , is a divine covenant and command, therefore, authority should be established from God, His Prophet, and the infallible successors who have been chosen by God. Reasons and Philosophy of Occultation Shi'a researchers believe that all the reasons and secrets for the occultation are not known, but the hadith emphasize on three things: 1. To Test the Faithful Based on Islamic sources, testing the creation and choosing the righteous ones of them, is one of the constant traditions of God. Life is full of tests for the pious whom use it to nurture their faith , patience and obeying of God's commands and reach perfection by flourishing their talents and abilities. Imam al-Mahdi's (a) occultation is a means to test; as the facade falls from the people with unstable belief, their doubts and uncertainty shall take over, while those whose belief have rooted into their hearts, shall become more experienced and worthy in faith and reach higher levels of piety and divine reward , as they bear through the troubles of time, awaiting the Imam. A narration from Imam Musa b. Ja'far (a) clearly expresses that God tests his creatures, by occultation . The narrations declared that testing people in the time of occultation is of the most difficult testings. The troubles of this test are for two reasons: First: When the period of occultation becomes lengthy, many people will face doubts and uncertainties. Some will doubt his birth, while others question whether he is still alive, but only the honest who have already passed their previous tests and have reached deep understanding will preserve their belief about the Imam. In a long hadith, the Prophet (s) mentions this issue and says, \"Al-Mahdi shall disappear from the sight of the Shi'a and his followers, and no one shall stay stable on their belief, except those who God has put their hearts on the path of faith, and made it worthy.\" Second: The troubles and pressures of the end of times will change the people to the extent that preserving faith and religion shall be a hard objective to achieve. The faith which the people hold will be seriously in danger . 2. To Save the Imam's Life A loot into some narrations suggests that God saved the Imam from the danger of being killed, by occultation, for had he appeared from the very beginning of his life, he would have been killed. Based on the same logic, if he appears before the time is right, his life will be in danger and shall fail to fulfill his Godly objectives and the great reformations he was created to make . 3. Being Free from Accepting the Leadership of the Illegitimate Ruler According to some narrations, the twelfth Imam shall not recognize any oppressive government, even as a dissimulation. He is not obliged to perform Taqiyya ( precautionary dissimulation) for any leader or king, and shall not live under the flag of any oppressor. He will perform God's rulings with no compromise, concern, or secrecy. In other words, he will be in occultation until he rises and thus be free from allegiance or loyalty to any leader or government.

{"title": "Life in Barzakh", "text": "Life in Barzakh refers to the life of souls in Barzakh which is required for an account of some religious facts such as dead ones' hearing and tawassul . For the proof of life in Barzakh, appeals are made to certain Qur'anic verses referring to the life of some groups of dead people, such as martyrs as well as some hadiths . Definition \"Life in Barzakh\" refers to the life of the dead in the inter-world or the Barzakh. According to some Qur'anic verses and hadiths, the souls of the dead enjoy life in the Barzakh and can make certain communications with people in this world. They hear the voices of people in this world and can respond to them. Barzakh Body The human body in the Barzakh is referred to as the Barzakh body or \"Mithali body\" (analogical body) to which the soul is attached after death. The Barzakh body is said not to be material, although it has certain material properties and features, such as shape and size. In Qur'an There are about 10 Qur'anic verses to which it is appealed to prove the life in Barzakh , such as verses referring to the postmortem life of certain groups of the dead, such as martyrs . There are also Qur'anic verses referring to conversations between the angels and the dead, a Heaven and a Hell in Barzakh, as well as verses referring to the life of the prophets in Barzakh. The Shi'as appeal to the verse Qur'an 9 :105 to show that the Prophet (s) and certain believers (that is, the Imams (a) ) are aware of people in this world. Thus, they appeal to this verse to show the life in Barzakh. In Hadith There are hadiths referring to the life of the prophets in Barzakh. Al-Bayhaqi has collected some such hadiths in his book, Hayat al-anbiya' ba'd wafatihim (the life of the prophets after their death). According to a hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (s) met the Prophet Moses (a) in the night of Mi'raj in his grave while he was saying prayers. Some Sunni scholars have explicitly maintained the life of the prophets in Barzakh. Al-Alusi takes the life of the prophets in Barzakh to be superior to that of the martyrs, saying that the life of prophets in Barzakh can be proved by reliable hadiths. The Shi'as have also appealed to certain hadiths, some of which are collected in the section, \"a section on the issue that the Imams (a) are witnesses of God, the Exalted, on His creatures,\" of the book, al-kafi , showing that the Imams (a) are aware of people in this world with the permission of God. They take these hadiths to show life in Barzakh. Wahhabi View Some Salafids , such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim, have accepted the life in Barzakh. But some Wahhabis have a specific view of the life in Barzakh according to which the souls of the dead cannot communicate with people in this world and hear their voices. But, proponents of the life in Barzakh believe that the denial of the life in Barzakh is not compatible with Qur'anic verses referring to the postmortem life, such as the ones according to which the prophets and friends of God enjoy life in the World of Barzakh, just as the Qur'an has explicitly referred to the postmortem life of the martyrs. Also, according to Islam, death does not amount to one's annihilation; rather it is a transfer from one world to another, and it is possible for people in this world to communicate with the souls in the world of Barzakh. Moreover, they argue that if the life in Barzakh, and in particular, the life of the prophets in Barzakh, is not accepted, then certain Qur'anic addresses, such as salutations on the prophets , God's command to the Prophet Muhammad (s) to talk with previous prophets , and the Qur'an's order to the believers to send regards to the Prophet (s) , will not make sense. They take as evidence for their claim the speeches of Salih (a) and Shu'ayb (a) addressing their punished and perished peoples, the Prophet's (s) speech to the killed polytheists after the Battle of Badr , and the speech of Imam 'Ali (a) to people who were killed in the Battle of Jamal .

{"title": "Qiyamat Sughra", "text": "Al-Qiyamah al-Ṣughra (the Lesser Resurrection) (Arabic: القیامة الصغری ) refers to the period between death and al-Qiyamah al-Kubra (the greater Resurrection). Referring to this hadith of the Prophet (s) saying, \"When a person dies, his resurrection will begin\" , some scholars of theology believe that every person has two resurrections: A lesser resurrection and a greater resurrection . The lesser resurrection of a person begins with his death and continues until the greater resurrection. Some theological books use the expression \"al-Qiayamah al-Sughra\" to refer to Barzakh . According to verses of the noble Qur'an , the time of the greater resurrection is unknown and only God knows about it. Fayd Kashani said that as soon as all humans die, the lesser resurrection will end and the greater resurrection will begin; but, the time when all people would die is known only by God. According to hadiths, the lesser resurrection is peculiar to humans, while in the greater resurrection, all beings will be present. In some hadiths and Shi'a books, Raj'a is referred to as the lesser resurrection. In the terminology of Islamic mysticism , the volitional death is referred to as the lesser resurrection.

{"title": "Principles of the Shi'a denomination", "text": " Principles of the Shi'a denomination are the fundamental beliefs in Shi'a Islam , including monotheism , prophethood , resurrection , divine justice , and imamate . According to the Shias, denial of any of the first three principles (monotheism, prophethood, and resurrection), which are the principles of the religion , amounts to disbelief in (and excommunication from) Islam, but the denial of divine justice or imamate only amounts to excommunication from the Shi'a denominations, and not Islam. What distinguishes Shias from other Islamic sects is that they view Imamate as fundamental to religion, which is why they are called \" Imamiyya .\" Moreover, the belief in the principle of divine justice distinguishes Mu'tazila and Shia from Ash'arites , which is why the Shia and Mu'tazila are called \" 'Adliyya .\" Place The principles of the Shi'a denomination are the five principles (monotheism, prophethood, resurrection, imamate, and divine justice), which constitute the foundation of the Shi'a denomination. The belief in all of these principles makes one a Shi'a, and the disbelief in any of them means that the person is not a Shi'a. The first three principles (monotheism, prophethood, and resurrection) are the Principles of the religion (Islam), the disbelief in which amounts to one's excommunication from Islam . Exclusively Shi'a Principles Imamate and divine justice are the exclusive principles of the Shi'a denomination. Imamate Imamate is the belief that imamate (leadership of the Islamic society and the succession of Prophet Muhammad (s) ) is a divine position. On this doctrine, God has appointed twelve persons from the descendants of the Prophet (s) as Imams. Here are the twelve Imams in order: Imam 'Ali (a) , Imam al-Hasan (a) , Imam al-Husayn (a) , Imam al-Sajjad (a) , Imam al-Baqir (a) , Imam al-Sadiq (a) , Imam al-Kazim (a) , Imam al-Rida (a) , Imam al-Jawad (a) , Imam al-Hadi (a) , Imam al-'Askari (a) , and Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Why is Imamate a Principle of the Denomination? According to Muhammad Husayn Kashif al-Ghita' in his Asl al-Shi'a wa usulu-ha , Shiism is distinguished from other Islamic sects by its belief in imamate. It is because of their belief in the imamate of the twelve Imams that they are called' \" Imamiyya .\" Thus, imamate is a principle of the Shi'a denomination, the denial of which amounts to excommunication from Shiism. Divine Justice This is the belief that God justly acts in the existential and legislative systems, and never does any injustice. 'Adliyya (that is, Shia and Mu'tazila who believe in divine justice) believe that the goodness and badness of things are rational. In this way, to say that God is just is to say that He acts in accordance with the goodness of things and does not do injustice because of its badness. In contrast, Ash'arites believe that the criterion for justice is God's act; that is, whatever He does is just and good, even if it counts as unjust from the human perspective. Why is Divine Justice a Principle of the Denomination? According to Misbah Yazdi , a Shi'a philosopher (d. 2021), divine justice counts as the principle of Shiism and Mu'tazilism because of its significance in theology . Moreover, Murtada Mutahhari , a Shi'a intellectual (d. 1979), believes that divine justice is among the principles of the Shi'a denomination because ideas such as the denial of human free will had become common among Muslims, which implied that it was unjust for God to punish sinful people because they had no free will and their acts were compulsory. The Shi'a and Mu'tazila believed that it was incompatible with divine justice to punish people without free will, which is why they came to be known as 'Adliyya (believes in divine justice). The Common Principles Monotheism : the belief in God's existence and oneness, and the belief that He has no partner. [18] Prophethood : the belief that God appointed certain people as prophets to guide people. [19] The first prophet was Adam (a) , [20] and the last prophet was Muhammad (s) . [21] Resurrection : the belief that humans come back to life after their death and their good or bad acts will be judged.

{"title": "Raj'a", "text": " Rajʿa (Arabic: الرَّجعَة ), is the belief that a group of people who have died will return to the Earth shortly after the reappearance of the twelfth Shi'a Imam, al-Mahdi (a) . It is a belief particular to the Shi'a Muslims. The Qur'an has mentioned the story of some people who have been resurrected after death. Based on some hadiths , a number of perfect believers as well as a number of complete infidels will return to this world. The return of Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) has been especially emphasized. Since there are mutawatir hadiths about raj'a, it is a certain fact. However, details about raj'a are not as certain. Etymology The word \"raj'a\" literally means 'to return'. In the Qur'an and narrations different terms have been used to refer to this doctrinal principle such as raj'a, karra, radd, hashr. However, raj'a is the most popular term. This form of Arabic infinitive (masdar al-marra) for raj'a translates into 'returning once, or to return once'. In Shi'a Beliefs As a technical term used in Islamic discourse and science, raj'a has been coined to represent the belief that at the time of Imam al-Mahdi's reappearance , God will bring back to life a number the deceased to the world with their worldly body. Creating an opportunity for the believers to reach their ultimate perfection is mentioned among the reasons behind raj'a. According to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) , those believers who do not achieve the blessing of martyrdom will achieve it during their raj'a. The purpose of this returning to life is for the Shi'as to aid and help the Imam (a) in his mission and for them to witness the establishment of his righteous government. Similarly, God will also bring back to life a number of the Imam's enemies so that they may taste the punishment of this world and witness, much to their regret, the glory and power of Imam al-Mahdi (a) 's government . Raj'a is considered one of the necessary components of the Shi'a belief system. Al-Sharif al-Murtada , a Shi'a scholar and theologian , says, \"The Twelver Shi'as are of the belief that at the time of Imam al-Mahdi's reappearance, God will bring back to a life a group among the believers, so that they may benefit from the righteous government of al-Mahdi (a), and gain the rewards of helping him and aiding him in establishing this government. A group from among the enemies will also be brought back to life, so that revenge can be taken on them.\" 'Allama Tabataba'i writes in al-Mizan , \"Although the non-Shi'a denominations, accept the belief in the reappearance of al-Mahdi (a), and have widely reported ( mutawatir ) narrations from the Prophet (s) in this regard, they reject the issue of raj'a, and see this to be a belief particular to the Shi'as.\" In Qur'an According to Shi'a theologians and Qur'anic commentators, there are verses in the Qur'an that speak about raj'a. Five verses refer to the resurrection of the dead in the past, these verses confirm the possibility of raj'a. Raising of the seventy companions of Prophet Musa (a) [1] Resurrection of 'Uzayr after one hundred years [2] Revival of a murdered person from the Israelites [3] Revival of thousands of people [4] Raising the dead by Jesus (a) [5] Some verses speak about the happening of raj'a in the future: The Qur'an 27 :83 is about a day in which a group from every nation will be resurrected, the verse is not about the Day of Judgement as on the Day of Judgement all people will be resurrected not just certain groups of them [6] The Qur'an 40 :11 quotes from the faithless in the Day of Judgement that they had died twice and had been revived twice. The two deaths and revivals show that they had experienced raj'a before the Day of Judgement [7] In Hadiths In his Bihar al-anwar , al-'Allama al-Majlisi mentions over one-hundred and sixty verses and narrations on the topic of raj'a. After quoting these hadiths, he says, \"For those who have faith in the words of the Imams (a), no room for doubt remains that raj'a is a true concept. The reason being, that the reports that have been collated from the Imams (a) on this matter are at the level of tawatur .The author of the Qur'anic exegesis Al-Mizan , 'Allama Tabataba'i , believes that these reports have reached a level of tawatur in meaning. So much so that even if a few of these reports were to be problematic or unclear, it would not affect the tawatur of the reports. Furthermore, the idea of raj'a appears in many of the recorded Ziyarahs and supplications, including the Al-Ziyara al-Jami'a al-Kabira , Ziyara Warith , Ziyara Arba'in , Ziyara Al Yasin , and Ziyara Rajabiyya , also the supplications of Wida' and 'Ahd . It is noteworthy to say that while Shi'as believe in raj'a, they do not consider the rejecters of raj'a as non-Muslim ( Kafir ), since raj'a is a necessary belief to be Shi'a, not Muslim, meaning the rejecter will still be in the fold of Islam. It is understood from a number of reports that belief in raj'a is a condition for perfect faith and true Islam. The Time of Raj'a About the time of raj'a, there are three possibilities: shortly before the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam (a); simultaneously with his reappearance; shortly after the reappearance. In some hadiths, whose chains of transmitters are weak, the time of raj'a is alluded to by the quite famous saying \"All wonders [take place] between Jumada and Rajab \" ( اَلْعَجَبُ كُلُّ الْعَجَبِ بَینَ جُمَادَی وَ رَجَب ). However, it is not possible to ascertain the exact time of, and the order of the events related to, raj'a. Those Who Will Experience Raj'a Although there is no doubt that raj'a will take place, as it is backed by widely transmitted hadiths, its details, including the number and identity of those who will return, are not certain. However, the majority of scholars maintain that during raj'a, only the Prophet (s) , the Imams (a) , and the pure believers and unbelievers will return. Prophets and Believers before the Advent of Islam According to some hadiths, Daniel (a) (Daniyal), Joshua (a) (Yusha'), Jesus (a) ('Isa), and Khidr are among those who will return. Also, it is mentioned that some believers and followers of the previous religions, such as the People of the Cave , will return. Return of Jesus Both Shi'a and Sunni sources state that the Jesus (a) will return at the time of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It can be understood from the traditions with certainty that Jesus (a) will return after the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and will pray behind him. According to some traditions, the Imam (a) will give Jesus (a) the leadership and governance of a part of the world. Sunni sources indicate that the duration of the return of Jesus (a) will be forty years. According to some hadiths, Qur'an 4 :159, \"There is none among the People of the Book but will surely believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them.\" is related to the return of Jesus (a). The Prophet (s), Ahl al-bayt (a), and Their Companions The Prophet (s) will return together with Imam Ali (a) . According to some hadiths, all the Imams (a) and some of their companions, such as Salman , Miqdad , Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari , Malik al-Ashtar , al-Mufaddal b. 'Umar , Humran b. A'yan , Muyassir b. 'Abd al-Aziz , and the companions of Imam al-Husayn (a) , will return. Some other hadiths state that pure believers and unbelievers will return, without giving any specific names. Several Returns of Imam Ali (a) According to sixs hadiths, which do not have reliable chains of transmitters, Imam Ali (a) will return several times. And after punishing the enemies, he will rule the earth. The First Returners In Tafsir al-'Ayyashi , the first returners are said to be Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions. A hadith in Bihar al-Anwar , which reports the conversation between Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions on the eve of Ashura , includes a description of what will happen at the time of raj'a. In another hadith, Imam al-Husayn (a) is with Imam al-Mahdi (a) when the latter passes away; Imam al-Husayn (a) perforsm burial rituals for him and then continues his rule for forty years. However, according to some other hadiths, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will be the last ruler. In some other hadiths, the first returner is said to be Imam Ali (a), but considering the hadiths that talk about several returns for Imam Ali (a), it is possible to infer that Imam Ali (a) will be the first returner before the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) will be the first returner after the reappearance. History in Shi'a Denominations In some reports, it has been recorded that shortly after the martyrdom of Imam 'Ali (a) , a group of people from Iraq developed the belief that Imam Ali (a) would return to this world before the final resurrection. Similar beliefs developed in different Shi'a denominations after the death or martyrdoms of personalities like Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya , Imam al-Kazim (a) , and Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) . In Other Religions The concept of raj'a can be found in the Old Testament . The Book of Ezekiel for instance, points towards the coming back to life of the Israelites and the rule of David (a) in the end of times . In the Book of Daniel, it is reported that 'In the end of times, many of those who are asleep within the earth will be awoken' . The New Testament also speaks about the returning to life of the righteous people and the establishment of the Messiah 's rule in the first resurrection, before the coming of the second resurrection . Related Works Due to the great importance of raj'a in the Shiite theological belief system, Shi'a scholars and narrators have written numerous books and treatises on the topic. Unfortunately, many of these works are no longer available to us, and have been lost. Now, only their names remain in the books of rijal and fihrist (lists of authors and their works). Aqa Buzurg Tihrani introduces thirty works written on this topic. Some of the most important ones that have been published are as follows: Al-Raj'a ; Mirza Muhammad Mu'min b. Dust Muhammad Husayni Astarabadi (annotated by Faris Hassun Karim and published by Anwar al-Huda Publications, 1417 /1996-7). Mirza Muhammad Mu'min was martyred in Mecca in the year 1088 /1677-8). In this work, after a short introduction regarding the necessity of turning to the Infallible Imams (a) in all affairs, and submitting to their words, Mirza Muhammad presents more than a hundred narrations on the topic of raj'a. Al-Iqaz min al-haj'a bi l-burhan 'ala l-raj'a ; Shaykh Muhammad b. Hasan al-Hurr al-'Amili (d. 1104 /1692-3). This book was authored in 1075 /1664-5; it contains over one-hundred and seventy narrations, including tens of verses and other proofs to establish the concept of raj'a. Raj'at ; Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi (d. 1111 /1699-700). This book was written in Persian. It contains fourteen narrations pertaining to the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam , al-Mahdi (a), and the topic of raj'a. It is worth noting that al-'Allama al-Majlisi has addressed in detail the issue of raj'a within his other famous work Bihar al-anwar . He presents approximately two-hundred narrations that have been reported on this topic . Al-Shi'a wa l-raj'a ; Muhammad Rida Tabasi Najafi (d. 1405 /1984-1985). This book was published in the year 1378 /1958-9 by al-Matba'a al-Haydariyya Publishers, Najaf . The book consists of theoretical, historical, linguistical, and ethical discussions, with research and analysis. In this book, the status of raj'a in the Qur'an , reported supplications, reported salutations ( Ziyarah ), the consensus of the scholars and the view of reputable figures, has been analyzed and reviewed. In the first chapter of this book, one-hundred and seventy-four verses of the Qur'an that have been interpreted as referring to raj'a according to the narrations, have been mentioned alongside the relevant narrations.

{"title": "Shafa'a", "text": " Shafāʿa (Arabic: الشفاعة , intercession) is a religious act, all Muslims and followers of divine religions believe in. Shafa'a means that on the Day of Judgment , friends of God and some holy entities such as the Qur'an , with some conditions, intercede for some wrong-doers and rescue them from hellfire or cause the promotion of some people. According to Shiite beliefs, Shafa'a completely belongs to God and nobody can intercede without His permission. If God is satisfied with one's faith , He will permit others to intercede for one. Shafa'a has been explicitly mentioned in Sunni sources stipulating the intercession of the Prophet (s) for believers. Among Muslims, Wahhabis believe that only God can be asked for Shafa'a and if someone asks others for Shafa'a (especially after their demise), he is a polytheist . Belief in Shafa'a has a special position among Shi'a . Definition The word of Shafa'a is derived from the root of \" ش ف ع \" meaning \"to append or join something to another\". Shafi' (intercessor) is called so because they join one to themselves and provide one with what one lacks and thus rescue one. Shafa'a in religious terminology means \"a creature's mediation between God and another creature in delivering the good or driving away the evil whether in this world or in the hereafter.\" Shafa'a means to make a change in the sinner so that the sinner no longer deserves to be punished and exclude one from the law of punishment; like repentance makes a wrongdoer no longer deserve the punishment and makes one deserve receiving God's forgiveness, as Imam 'Ali (a) has said: \"There is no Shafi' (intercessor) more rescuing than repentance.\" Shafi' (intercessor) is called so because this person tries to adjoin someone else to himself and recompense the person's sins. Shafa'a has a close relation with Tawassul (entreaty): Tawassul is the act of one who takes refuge to a person and asks for intercession and thus Shafa'a is the act of the person asking God to forgive that wrongdoer. The belief in Shafa'a also exists in other divine religions such as Judaism and Christianity . In the Qur'an Shafa'a has been clearly stated in the Qur'an in 24 verses many of which negates the pagans' belief in the intercession of idols. \"They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you inform Allah about something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?’ Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]!\" ( Qur'an 10 :18) Although the Qur'an denies the intercession of the idols, it has acknowledged the intercession of some figures such as the Prophet (s) with some conditions. Therefore, Muslims have no disagreement on the principle of Shafa'a in general and disagree only on its rulings and position. For example, in the verse \"And keep vigil for a part of the night, as a supererogatory [devotion] for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to a praiseworthy station.\" ( Qur'an 17 :79) Shi'a and Sunni exegetes agree that by \"a praiseworthy station\", the position of Shafa'a is meant which God has promised to His Messenger (s). The verses mentioned in the Qur'an about Shafa'a can be categorized in some groups, Some of them totally reject Shafa'a in the hereafter, [5] Some regard Shafa'a exclusive to God, [6] Some regard Shafa'a conditioned to the permission and order of God, [7] Some reject Shafa'a about some people. Studying all the verses of Shafa'a, it can be inferred that the Qur'an approves of a kind of Shafa'a and disapproves and rejects other kinds of Shafa'a. The verses which reject Shafa'a imply that no one other than God has such a right and those verses which support Shafa'a imply that Shafa'a belongs to God and others can do Shafa'a only by His permission. “ Intercession is of no avail with Him except for those whom He permits. ” — Quran, 34:23 In Hadiths In hadiths narrated from the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , the truth of Shafa'a has clearly been approved and explained. The Prophet (s) stated, \" God blessed me with five privileges… one of which is [the right to make] Shafa'a and I have secured it for my people. Shafa'a will be for those who do not commit polytheism .\" [8] The Prophet (s) also said, \"three groups make Shafa'a for sinners before God and their Shafa'a will be accepted: Prophets (a) , scholars of religion, and the martyrs .\" [9] The hadiths of Shafa'a are in three groups: Hadiths which say that Shafa'a will make a sinner be forgiven from going to the hell . Hadiths which say that some sinners after a while staying in the hell will enjoy Shafa'a and rescued from punishment . Hadiths which say that some people will never enjoy Shafa'a and will eternally remain in hell. Therefore, those hadiths which say that anyone having a particle of faith will enjoy Shafa'a do not disagree those hadiths which say one who does some very wrong acts such as he takes the prayer of little importance will not enjoy Shafa'a, because anyone who believes in God will once enjoy Shafa'a but he will be long left in hell so that some of his impurities will be cleansed and deserve Shafa'a. In the View of Intellect From the point of hadiths, validity of Shafa'a is definite and its rulings are clear; however, Muslim thinkers have mentioned rational justifications as well. Morteza Motahhari wrote, \"Even if there was no traditional justification for Shafa'a, we had to justify it using intellect and rational arguments such as the argument of Imkan Ashraf (the Possibility of the Superior) and the nature of organizational creation. When a person accepts the existence of God 's forgiveness, definite rational principles make him say that forgiveness needs to flow through a total intellect or soul, i.e. the intellect and soul of one who has the position of total divine Wilaya ; and it is not possible that God's mercy reaches creation without order.\" From intellectual point of view, Shafa'a is flowing in the creation and is the requirement of the system of causality . Rational justification is based on two criteria: The general mercy of God : God's mercy is general and reaches all creatures. And if a creature receives a smaller proportion of divine mercy, it would only be due to his own incompetence. Basically, no creature can ever reach happiness and success alone without divine mercy or rescues punishment. Organizational nature of world: from rational viewpoint, the world has an organization and hierarchy. This system of hierarchy is the very same system of causality. Material needs of human beings are fulfilled through a chain of natural causes which all effect by the permission of God. [11] Even though mercy and forgiveness of God is general but it is not excluded from this law and they are impossible to reach the creation without means and this is true about all kinds of divine mercy. For example, revelation which is an instance of God's guidance and mercy is not received by all human beings, but only certain people receive it and other people benefit from it through these people; because no one other than prophets (a) has such a competence to be directly addressed by God. And this is that very hierarchical system of creation. Or for another example, when Istisqa prayer (prayer requesting rain) is made, it is not that it rains without any change in the weather; but due to the Istisqa prayer, God provides all the causes and means of raining including the wind and condensation of clouds. The same way as the Istisqa prayer causes that the requirements for raining are provided, Shafa'a, repentance , and such cause a change in the states of the sinner so that he acquires the competence for forgiveness, decrease of punishment or promotion. The position of Shafa'a in this system is that it promotes a person's competence so that he can more benefit from God's general mercy. It is due to this rationality that if a one lacks perfection, it needs to acquire that perfection from a source of perfection and if it does not have the competence to receive perfection, it needs to develop its competence to necessary level. Such an action not only breaks no rule but it is in fact what rationality requires. Therefore, Shafa'a about a person does not imply that while he is incompetent and lacks the requirements, making Shafa'a will be accepted about him; also, Shafa'a in legislation does not mean to cancel the law and not applying the law about that wrongdoer who is deserved to be punished; rather, Shafa'a means to make such a change in that person so that he would not deserve punishment anymore and he will be excluded from that law of punishment, the same way repentance rescues a person from punishment and makes him deserved of God's forgiveness. Therefore, it is mentioned in hadiths that Shafa'a is the best of Shafi' (intercessor). In other words, the essential difference between the true Shafa'a with a false one is that true Shafa'a initiates from God and ends with the sinner and intercessor is only the means of delivering God's mercy to lower levels; however, in false Shafa'a, like favoring someone, the wrongdoer without having the required competence and only through relation requests for something. Types In Creation and Legislation Shafa'a in creation means that the origin of any action or effect is God and all other causes and means are only means through which God's mercy is delivered to lower levels by His permission. This way, all the causes in the world are intercessors of their effects since they deliver God's mercy to lower levels. For example, the sun is the intercessor of the wheat grain to make it grow. In the Qur'an we read, “ To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that may intercede with Him except with His permission? ” — Qur'an, 2:255 Shafa'a in legislation means that God, out of His mercy, has sent laws for people which guide them and in fact intercede them to enter the paradise . All religious rulings are of this type. False Intercession False Shafa'a is that the wrongdoer acts against the law and influences the will of the lawmaker through an illegal way. Such kind of Shafa'a in this world is an act of oppression and it is impossible in the hereafter . The objections to Shafa'a are mostly of this kind and this is rejected in the Qur'an as well. The false Shafa'a originates from the belief in Tafwid (unrestricted human delegation) which is a wrong belief meaning that after creating the world, God delegated its management to others and He has no role in it and thus people would be able to make Shafa'a independently and if one can attract the intercessors' favor, he would not need God. True Intercession True Shafa'a as mentioned in the Qur'an which is believed by Shi'a and supported by Imams (a) is that Shafa'a in its wholeness belongs to God and no one can make Shafa'a without His permission. Prophets (a) and Imams' (a) Shafa'a never means that they have an independent role or that to be privileged by their Shafa'a, one would need to do anything other than what God has ordered. On the contrary, they would only make Shafa'a for someone, God would be pleased with, “ …and they do not intercede except for someone He approves of,… ” — 21:28, Qur'an For Forgiveness and for Propmotion Sometimes, Shafa'a is for promotion which is accepted by all Islamic schools and sometimes, it is for forgiveness of the sins which some schools such as Mu'tazilites and Kharijites reject. These two schools do not accept that Shafa'a would be made about those who commit capital sins and those who have entered the hell. They say that, \"one who has entered the hell would not exit it.\" Sometimes, Shafa'a is about issues in the hereafter, such as the Shafa'a of the Prophet (s) for the sinners on the Day of Judgment and it is sometimes about issues of this world. If some actions are good, Shafa'a for them is also good, and if it is about sins, it is not only bad but also the intercessor needs to take the responsibility for a part of it. Requirements Due to the educational purpose and avoiding people from being bold in committing sins, the Qur'an and hadiths have not mentioned all the details and requirements for one to be interceded for; however, they have mentioned some necessary requirements. The most important requirement for one to be interceded for is that God approves of him. From the verse of the Qur'an, two requirements can be understood for those who are going to be interceded for: To have taken a covenant with God [18] To be witness to the truth [19] It is obvious that one who needs Shafa'a of forgiveness because of some sins, God does not approve his act; rather, it means that God approves of that person's religion and beliefs. In other words, the one who is going to be interceded for even if is a sinner and has committed greater sins, he must have not cut his relation with God and leaders of religion. Obstacles of Shafa'a From the Qur'an, it can be understood that some issues are obstacles for benefiting from Shafa'a. Some groups who are deprived of Shafa'a are as follows: Disbelievers and polytheists Traitors Hypocrites Oppressors Enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) (Nasibis) Deniers of the Wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) and other Imams (a) Those who harassed the progeny and children of the Prophet (s) Deniers of Shafa'a Those who do not take prayer seriously Those who abandon prayer Intercessors Shafa'a in creation as the influence of causes exists in whole creation. Therefore, in hadiths, the right to make Shafa'a is also mentioned for some places as well as for people and groups and it refers to the effect of such issues in the guidance of people. In Shafa'a of legislation, intercessors are either among the righteous acts of a person, prophets (s), friends of God or other issues. God the Almighty: Since God is All-merciful, after that intercessors make Shafa'a for people on the Day of Judgment, many people who will be deprived of all intercessors' Shafa'a will receive God's Sahfa'a and mercy. [21] The Prophet (s) : the Prophet's (s) Shafa'a is called Shafa'a al-Kubra (great intercession). In different hadiths, it is mentioned that his Shafa'a will include those believers who have committed greater sins . Imam 'Ali (a) Lady Fatima (a) Imams (a) The Qur'an Prophets (a) and friends of God . [22] Angels [23] Repentance : The superiority of the intercession of the prophets (a) and angels over repentance is that their Shafa'a is effective also on the Day of Judgment ; while, repentance is only for this world. Religious scholars [24] Martyrs Effects The nature of Shafa'a is neither encouraging to sin , nor a green light for sinners. It is not a cause of staying behind or mediation either; rather, it is an important educational issue which has constructive effects, some of which are mentioned below: Raising hope: Usually, the power of the self and lowly desires leads to committing great sins and following it, a spirit of disappointment takes over the person and this disappointment leads the person to more corruption. On the contrary, being hopeful in Sahfa'a of the friends of God, as a preventive factor, gives people hope that if they correct themselves, their bad past could be compensated through Shafa'a of the righteous and the pure. Establishing spiritual connection with friends of God: Obviously, someone who hopes in Shafa'a, tries to establish such a relation and does something which pleases them and does not break his cord of love with them, which can lead to doing more good deeds. Trying to Acquire the Prerequisites of Sahafa'a: The hopeful in Shafa'a need to review their deeds in the past and make better decisions about the future for Sahfa'a would not happen without proper background; and that is because Shafa'a is a kind of bestowing mercy which actualizes due to the proper background of the one who is interceded for and also because of the honor, dignity and righteous deeds of the intercessor. [25] Wahhabis and Shafa'a All Sunnis including Wahhabis believe in Shafa'a. The leader of Wahhabis, Ibn Taymiyya said, \"Hadiths about Shafa'a are many and frequently narrated in Sahih Muslim and Sahih al-Bukhari and many of them also exist in Sunan and Masanid.\" Elsewhere he said, \"The Prophet (s) will have three kinds of Shafa'a on the Day of Judgment … The third type of Shafa'a is for those who deserve the hellfire. Shafa'a of the Prophet (s), other prophets (a), the righteous and others is so that a person who deserves the hellfire, will not enter it and it is also for the one who has entered the hellfire (to be rescued).\" They believe in the request of Shafa'a from prophets (a) and the righteous in this world during the lifetime of the intercessors and also on the Day of Judgment. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Hasan b. Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1285/1869) said, \"Asking for Shafa'a from the Prophet (s) during his lifetime is because of his du'a and his du'a is accepted, but after his demise, asking Shafa'a from him is impermissible.\" The disagreement between Wahhabis and other Muslims is over requesting Shafa'a from prophets (a) and friends of God during Barzakh (the Middle World), about which, since Wahhabis do not believe in the life in Barzakh, they regard this kind of Shafa'a impermissible and even consider it an example of polytheism . 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab said, \"We approve of Shafa'a for our prophet (s) on the Day of Judgment according to hadiths. We also approve of it for other prophets (a), angels, friends of God and children due to the reports we have received, but we seek Shafa'a from its owner (God)… Shafa'a needs to be requested from God not intercessors, e.g. one should not say, \"O the Messenger of God! O the friend of God! I ask you Shafa'a or its means. … or similar expressions, which no one other than God has the power upon them. Request for Shafa'a from the intercessors while they are in Barzakh is a kind of polytheism.\" Criticisms of Wahhabis The most important criticisms mentioned by Wahhabis are: Polytheism Asking Shafa'a from the intercessor means to call anyone other than God and this is polytheism in worshiping, because God says, “ \"so do not invoke anyone along with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 72:18 Answer The above criticism comes from Wahhabis' misunderstanding of the meaning of unity of God and polytheism. The true understanding of polytheism and unity of God implies that invoking anyone other than God does not mean polytheism in itself and it is not even forbidden since polytheism refers to cases in which one believes an independent divinity and lordship other than God and Shi'a never believe as such neither about their Imams (a) nor any other beings but for Allah alone. Undoubtedly, invoking Muslims and requesting them for help is a permissible action and they need to help such an invoker as much as they can. On the other hand, when an action is permissible for a person, asking him to do that is permissible as well. When Shafa'a would be permissible for the Prophet (s) and other intercessors, asking Shafa'a from them would also be permissible. Asking people for making du'a for one is permissible in the view of all Muslims such as that we ask someone, \"make du'a for me\"; therefore, asking Shafa'a from a person who has permission for that from God , such as he is asked, \"make Shafa'a for me before God\" is also permissible. To forgive sins, God invites people to ask the Prophet (s) to make du'a for their forgiveness, “ \"Had they, when they wronged themselves, come to you and pleaded to Allah for forgiveness, and the Apostle had pleaded for forgiveness for them, they would have surely found Allah all-clement, all-merciful.\" ” — Qur'an, 4:64 Some tried to explain the meaning of this verse so that, people who have harassed the Prophet (s) needed to ask him for forgiveness; but through a more careful look into the verse, wrongness of this interpretation can be understood so that, if the Prophet (s) was about to forgive people's sin about his own rights, the verse needed to say \"and the Apostle had forgave them\" while the verse says, \"the Apostle had pleaded for them\". Moreover, the above mentioned verse Wahhabis refer to ( Qur'an 72 :18) prohibits Muslims from partnership and association, i.e. that Muslims do not consider anyone at similar level with God. The verse actually addresses polytheists who regarded the means independently. Also, if asking anyone other than God is a polytheistic act, there would be no difference between the life and after death of people and thus no one should ever ask the Prophet (s) or another even during their lifetimes. In authentic Sunni hadiths, it is mentioned that al-Tirmidhi quoted from Anas b. Malik that he asked the Prophet (s) to make Shafa'a for him on the Day of Judgment . He is quoted as saying, \"I asked the Prophet (s) to make Shafa'a for me on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet (s) said, 'I will.' I said, 'where should I look for you then?' He (s) said, 'first near al-Sirat Bridge .'\" Excluding Shafa'a to God The Qur'an considers the right to make Shafa'a exclusive to God, “ \"Say, All intercession rests with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 39:44 Therefore, Shafa'a need to be requested from God alone. Answer Shafa'a from this aspect that it is a kind of making influence in the creation, is among the manifestations of God's Lordship and thus it belongs to Him; however, this does not contradict with believing in the rights of Shafa'a for prophets (a) and the righteous; because, their Shafa'a is not independent but depending on the permission of God while it is the same in other issues. In the Qur'an God says, “ …that power, altogether, belongs to Allah… ” — 2:165, Qur'an which means that all the powers in the world belongs to God and all the creatures gain power by His permission and will and to the extent that He wishes and after God gives a being power, then that being can be asked for help. Also, the verse “ \"Say, 'All intercession rests with Allah\" ” — Qur'an, 39:44 means that if God sees it appropriate and gives the right to make Shafa'a to a being, then that being can be requested to use the permission God has given him for the one requesting. Resembling Polytheists In the Qur'an, God considers the polytheists of the time of the Prophet (s) polytheist because they ask Shafa'a from other than God, “ They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.' ” — Qur'an, 10:18 Answer There is no doubt that polytheists of the time of the Prophet (s) considered the rights to ask their idols and gods for Shafa'a, but this verse implies that they worshiped idols and also considered the rights of Shafa'a for them and thus believing in their Shafa'a together with worshiping them led to their criticism. Polytheists considered unconditional rights of Shafa'a for their idols which God never had given them such position. Also, they believed in their divinity and worshiped them; while if one believes in someone's rights of Shafa'a God has given him and that using such rights is by the permission of God, then there would be no problem. On the other hand, no Muslim considers the position of divinity for intercessors to worship them so that his act resembles the acts of the polytheists. It is obvious that only showing respect and kissing Darih in holy shrines without believing in divinity would not be considered as worship; for if it was considered so, then respecting and kissing the hands of parents would also be considered as worshiping them. Another point is that idols made of stone and wood had no permission to harm or benefit and it was only the claim of idol-worshipers who believed in the effects of those stone and wood and their beliefs are different from the effects believed to exist in the Shafa'a of the intercessors by the permission of God. In the above mentioned verse, God addresses the idol-worshipers that, \"you believe in positions for idols I have not given to them. Do you want to give news to God about what (idols' effects) He does not have news about?\" and this is different with asking the friends of God for Shafa'a. This verse has not mentioned anything about asking for Shafa'a; rather it addresses believing in the Shafa'a of idols, \"they say, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.'\" and it has not said, \"they say, make intercession for us before Allah.'\" Therefore, if Wahhabi's reasoning is right, then believing in Shafa'a would be totally polytheistic and this includes Wahhabis as well, because they believe in Shafa'a in general. Hadith Rejecting the Request for Shafa'a from People It is narrated from Imam 'Ali (a) in Nahj al-Balagha saying, \"Know that He Who owns the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth has permitted you to pray to Him and has promised you acceptance of the prayer. He has commanded you to beg from Him in order that He may give you and to seek His mercy in order that He may have mercy on you. He has not placed anything between you and Him that may veil Him from you. He has not required you to get a mediator for you to Him, and if you err, He has not prevented you from repentance.\" Answer Firstly, Shafa'a is among the issues which all of Muslims, even Wahhabis , have accepted and it is mentioned the Qur'an and hadiths . Secondly, by the sentence \"He has not required you to get a mediator for you to Him\", Imam 'Ali (a) meant that God's mercy upon people is not like people's so that when they do not know some people, they refer to some people to introduce them to those people so that they can reach their wishes; because God is the Knower of secrets and the Unseen and knows all humans and their requests directly; but He refers people to the means due to His wisdom and because the causal system in the world of nature and spirituality requires. God Almighty has not made human distressed so that he needs to refer to a mediator or an intercessor; because the need for a mediator is when there is no access to the main person either due to his meanness or ignorance about the rights of the one who requests; while God has no meanness or restriction of access contrary to the opinions of the Christians and polytheists who believe that there needs to be means between God and human beings. Request from Those who have Passed away Wahhabis say that asking Shafa'a from intercessors after their demise is impermissible since it is a polytheistic act and the dead cannot hear the living. Answer If some action are polytheistic, it would be polytheistic both in this world and the hereafter and there would be no difference. Moreover, death is about body, while soul is living and hearing du'as and Shafa'a and answering it is related with the soul not the body. There are many Sunni hadiths about reciting Salawat upon the Prophet (s) and saying Salam (salutation) to him from far or near and it is clarified that the Prophet (s) hears these Salams and praises and answers to them. We Have No Rights to Ask Them Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab says, \"If one says that, 'the Prophet (s) is given the rights to make Shafa'a and I ask him about what God has given to him'; the answer would be that God has given him the rights to make Shafa'a, but He has prohibited you from asking him and has said that, 'so do not invoke anyone along with Allah . (72:18)'\" Answer Firstly, the above verse has no relation with asking for Shafa'a; and it is about the polytheists who considered independent partners for God and asked them their requests and thus such verses cannot be identified with believers. Secondly, as it is mentioned above, the meaning of this verse and other such verses which have come with \" مع \" [with] is that no being should ever be considered at the same level with God, but if one believes that God has given permission to a means or mediator to do something while he considers anything done by the order of God; this would not be an act of polytheism, and it is along with monotheism, the same as when in the Qur'an , Prophet Jesus (a) attributes healing the sick, reviving the dead, and even creating a bird from mud to himself but depending on the permission of God. Deniers of Shafa'a Those who have basically denied Shafa'a have mentioned some reasons: Boldness over Sinning Some believe that believing in Shafa'a causes boldness over sinning in people and revives the spirit of transgression in sinners and criminals; thus, believing in it is not compatible with the spirit of the Islamic law and other laws. Answer Firstly, if it is so, repentance which brings the forgiveness of sins can be considered as encouraging people to sin again; while, repentance is an original Islamic belief and agreed by all Muslims. Secondly, Shafa'a would lead to transgression only if includes all criminals in general; but, if it becomes ambiguous that for what sins and sinners and when on the Day of Judgment , Sahfa'a would be used, then it would not lead to encouragement of sinning. There is No Need for a Mediator God is closer to human beings than their veins and more merciful than anyone to His creation, thus why would we go to anyone other than Him for any request. Answer It is true that God is closer to us than our vein, but the wisdom of creation of human being on earth has required that God sends His messengers to guide people than speaking directly to them and that wisdom also required that the position of these messengers would be high before people so that the guidance would be accomplished in a better way, therefore God granted them infallibility from sinning and error, so that human being would follow them confidently and gave them positions in appearance so that their great positions before God is better known to people and attracted people's hearts to them. In the Qur'an, God mentions some cases and tells people to take these people as mediator in order to reach better results, cases such as the brothers of Prophet Joseph (a) who asked their father to intercede for them and ask God for their forgiveness , or elsewhere introduced the Last Prophet's (s) asking for forgiveness more effective than people's own supplication or mentioned that people referred to prophet Jesus (s) as the divine proof of their time to heal their sick ones and solve their problems. If it was wrong to take a mediator while knowing the closeness of God, it must have been criticized in the Qur'an, not introducing it to people as a recommended act. Justice or Oppression Shafa'a removes the punishment, which is either justice or oppression. If it is justice, then punishment has been God's oppression (God forbids), and if it's not and punishment is justice, then Sahfa'a of intercessors and their action in removing the punishment is oppression. Answer Removing the punishment can be mercy and neither labels of justice or punishment applies about it. In other words, removing punishment is mercy and above justice. God, the Immaculate has determined punishment for wrongdoers according to His justice, but removing punishment due to Shafa'a is mercy and kindness. God has taught His servants to be just and ordered them to try to reach the level higher than justice which is kindness, “ \"Indeed Allah enjoins justice and kindness,…\" ” — Qur'an, 19:90 He also taught His servants that if one did wrong about you, you can punish one due to justice, however it would be better if you forgive one due to patience and kindness.

{"title": "Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": " Ẓuhūr (Arabic: الظُهُور , Reappearance) in the terminology of Twelver Shiites means the rise and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) after his Major Occultation in order to establish a just world government. Literal Meaning The word \"Zuhur\" literally means the appearance or manifestation of something hidden. The word seems to imply an intense manifestation after being hidden or unseen. Stages The period of Zuhur can be divided into the following stages: The reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) which is only decided by the divine volition and knowledge. The rise and movement of Imam al-Mahdi (a) against the enemies and cruel governments of the world. The establishment of the world government. First Stage (Reappearance) Zurara b. A'yan quoted Imam al-Baqir (a) as saying that \" al-Qa'im [that is, Imam al-Mahdi (a)] has an occultation before his reappearance\". Imam al-Sadiq (a) said that \"when God wills to uncover his (that is, Imam al-Mahdi (a)'s) status, He will inspire it in his heart, and then he reappears and undertakes the divine task\". It is worth mentioning that the stage of rising (such as undertaking tasks) is later than the stage of reappearance. That is, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will first reappear, and after his companions gather around him and other conditions are met, he will rise against cruel governments. Second Stage (Rising) Imam al-Sajjad (a) is quoted as saying that \"when our al-Qa'im rises, God will remove fear from the hearts of our Shiites \". Imam al-Sadiq (a) said: \"al-Qa'im will rise when he is not under the pledge of allegiance with anyone\". It is not the case that all hadiths using the word \"Qiyam\" (rising) and its cognates about Imam al-Mahdi (a) are concerned with the stage of rising; there are some hadiths in which the word is used for the stage of reappearance. However, it remains true that most of such hadiths concern the stage after the reappearance. The Prophet (s) is quoted as saying that \"the resurrection will not arrive until \"al-Qa'im\" rises for the rights of our household\". Imam al-Baqir (a) is quoted as saying that \"when our al-Qa'im rises, God will put His hand on the heads of people, so that they can focus their thoughts\". The conflicts among some hadiths about the time of reappearance might be resolved by saying that some are concerned with the time of Zuhur or reappearance and some are concerned with the time of uprising. It is worth saying that some hadiths have talked about Imam al-Mahdi (a) 's reappearance and uprising as \"Khurūj\" (rising against the government). According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a): \"al-Qa'im's Khuruj (uprising) is certain\". Third stage (Imam al-Mahdi (a)'s Government) According to a hadith from the Prophet (s): \"the world does not come to an end until a man from my household will rise and govern like the household of Dawud \". According to another hadith from the Prophet (s): \"I give you good news about al-Mahdi , a man from Quraysh , by whose rule all the inhabitants of the heaven and the Earth are satisfied\". And in another hadith he is quoted as saying that \"a man from my people will rise and all people in the heaven and the Earth will love him\". Signs Signs of Reappearance ( علائم الظهور ) are those events which have been predicted by the Infallibles (a) to happen before or on the verge of the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the happening of each of them is considered a good news for approaching his uprising in the world; so that, he (a) will rise after the last in the series of these signs happen. The Siren , rising of Sufyani , etc. are among these signs. Time One question with which many people are concerned is when Imam al-Mahdi (a) will reappear and whether there is any specific time for his reappearance. According to hadiths from Imams (a), the time of his reappearance or Zuhur is unknown to people. Imam al-Sadiq (a) is quoted as saying that \"we never determined a time for the reappearance in the past, nor will we do so in the future\". Therefore, as emphasized in some hadiths, people who predict certain times for the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are imposters and liars. Imam al-Baqir (a) told one of his companions who asked him about the time of reappearance: \"people who determine times for the reappearance are liars; they lie, they lie\". These hadiths clarify that there were always people, with diabolical motivations, who determined times for Imam al-Mahdi (a)'s reappearance, as there will be such people in the future. Therefore, Imams (a) asked Shiites not to be indifferent to these people; rather they should reject and deny them. Imam al-Sadiq (a) told one of his companions: \"do not be afraid of rejecting a person who determines a time for the reappearance, since we have never determined a time for this\".

{"title": "Tabarruk", "text": " Tabarruk (Arabic: التَبَرُّک , to bless) is the religious practice of asking for blessing and a request for favor and grace from God and holy beings. The subject of tabarruk can be human beings such as prophets (a) and Imams (a) or things such as the Qur'an or places such as Ka'ba . In addition to having references in the Qur'an, hadiths and the conduct of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a), tabarruk is justifiable and valid according to theological and psychological principles. According to verses of the Qur'an, tabarruk has been practiced by other prophets (a) as well. Admissibility and legitimacy of tabarruk is accepted by all Islamic sects and only Wahhabis rejecte its admissibility and consider it an example of polytheism . Definition Terminology In the terminology of religious texts, tabarruk means seeking divine blessing and grace from a person or thing God has given privilege; whether a worldly blessing such as the increase of income or a blessing for the hereafter such as the spiritual promotion. Through seeking tabarruk, one tries to benefit from divine grace and power out of blessings. Blessings are divine gifts bestowed upon people, nature and things and consists of worldly or spiritual benefits which origin from divine mercy . This way, it can be interpreted as a transfer of a holy and efficient power emanated from the supernatural world and gives the receiver a new quality. Some scholars believe that in the process of blessing, a favorable effect from a holy and exalted being granted upon non-holy beings and accompanies an emanation of the holiness in a merciful manner. In this process, three things happen: Establishment of connection with the supernatural world Transfer of the holy power to another being or thing Existential promotion of the blessed being or thing [3] Connection through Tawassul [Entreaty] Tabarruk and tawassul have many points of similarity regarding their concepts and features, especially in those cases when through tabarruk people seek to achieve a spiritual blessing. Some scholars believe that since the reality of tabarruk is tawassul, there is no difference between them. However, these two concepts have differences in that tawassul is to ask religious nobilities to ask God for something and tabarruk is asking for a worldly or spiritual blessing which God has trusted some people or things with. In the Qur'an and Hadiths The word \"tabarruk\" is not used in the Qur'an , but other derivatives from its root are mentioned 34 times including the words, \"barak-a\", \"barakna\", \"burik-a\", \"tabarak-a\", \"barakat\", \"barakatuh\", \"mubarak\", \"mubarak-an\", and \"mubaraka\". In the Qur'an, The word \"Mubarak\" [blessed] is used to describe certain people, beings, places, and times. Blessed Beings Prophet Noah (a) and his companions, \"It was said, 'O Noah! Disembark in peace from Us and with [Our] blessings upon you and upon nations [to descend] from those who are with you, and nations whom We shall provide for, then a painful punishment from Us shall befall them.'\" [5] Prophets Abraham (a) and Isaac (a) , \"And We blessed him and Isaac.\" [6] Prophet Moses (a) and Angels , \"So when he came to it, he was called: 'Blessed is He who is in the fire and who is [as well] around it, …\" [7] Prophet Jesus (a) , \"He has made me blessed, wherever I may be,\" [8] Family of Abraham (a), \"…[That is] Allah's mercy and His blessings upon you, members of the household.\" [9] The Glorious Qur'an , \"And this Book that We have sent down is a blessed one….\" [10] Rain Water, \"And We send down from the sky salubrious water, …\" [11] Olive Tree, \"… from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western,…\" [12] Blessed Places Ka'ba [13] and al-Masjid al-Haram , \"Indeed the first house to be set up for mankind is the one at Bakkah blessed...\" [14] Al-Masjid al-Nabawi [15] Medina [16] The holy land of Tur, \"When he (Moses) approached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley at the blessed spot …\" [17] Palestine [18] Al-Aqsa Mosque and around it, \"Al-Aqsa Mosque whose environs We have blessed, …\" [19] Egypt [20] and Syria [21] [Levant], \"We made the people who were abased the heirs to the east and west of the land which We had blessed, …\" [22] Yemen [23] Lands between Euphrates , Palestine to al-Arish region of Egypt. This area is blessed with material blessings [24] as well as being spiritually blessed by being the origin of most prophets, spread of religions and Divine Books, [25] residence of prophets [26] and graves of prophets such as prophets Abraham (a) , Isaac (a) , Jacob (a) and righteous people. [27] In the Bible A historical background of tabarruk is given in religious scriptures: In the Old Testament, tabarruk is mentioned in what happened to Prophets Jacob (a) and Joseph (a) . By reciting prayer on their food, Jews bless it and then they have it. In the gospel of Mark, Jesus (a) is considered blessed. In the gospel of Barnabas, it is mentioned that creatures were blessed by the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Early Jews had a custom to bless themselves by applying a blessed ointment to their bodies It is said that the reason for calling Jesus as Christ was because he was blessed by the mentioned blessed ointment. Permissibility of Tabarruk According to common opinion of Muslims , from ideological and theological perspective, visiting the graves of the friends of God and seeking blessings from what is attributed to them has been a good act. Divine blessings and forgiveness bestows upon people through some means including prophets and friends of God. In this process, the means are assigned by God and the origin of blessings is God Himself and means from which Muslims seek blessing do not have any position independent from God and thus seeking tabarruk from them does not signify polytheism . Shi'a Authorities In the views of Shi'a authorities , seeking blessings from what is holy and pure in Islam is permissible and even recommended. In their view, seeking tabarruk from the names of Imams (a) by writing them on the shroud, naming children after their names, seeking tabarruk from holy shrines and the soil of the graves of the infallible (a) for example by putting it in the grave, seeking tabarruk from the Qur'an by writing it on the shroud and touching its words and letters are recommended. Shi'a bring evidence for permissibility of seeking tabarruk from the Qur'an and the conduct of the Prophet (s) and Muslims. Moreover, the principle of ibaha [primary intellectual judgment] and the permission for cases for which seeking tabarruk is questionable or are not definitely admissible can solve the issue of permissibility. Sunni Authorities Sunni authorities and scholars have disagreements over recommendation or kiraha of seeking tabarruk from the Prophet's (a) grave. However, according to their wordings, their opinion suggesting dislike seems to be out of fear for approaching the grave and touching the body to it for observing manner before God. Hanbalis and Hanafis Ahmad b. Hanbal regards it permissible to seek tabarruk from the pulpit and the grave of the Prophet (s) and kissing them. Also, Shihab al-Din al-Khafaji who is one of the Hanafi scholars considers it permissible to touch and kiss the grave of the Prophet (s), however regard it disliked (makruh). Shafi'is Some Shafi'i scholars such as al-Ramli al-Shafi'i consider it permissible to touch the graves of the Prophet (s), friends of God and Islamic scholars and also kissing the entrance gates to graves of the friends of God with the intention of seeking tabarruk. Also Muhib al-Din al-Tabari considered it permissible to touch the grave and kiss it and regarded it in agreement with the conduct of the scholars and righteous people. Malikis Al-Zarqani al-Maliki believes that there is no problem in kissing the grave of the Prophet (s) with the intention of seeking tabarruk. Wahhabis Wahhabis do not consider it permissible to seek tabarruk of any kind. Accordingly, they have issued some opinions and reasons as following: First Opinion Some of them say that although at the time of the Prophet (s) , Companions used to seek tabarruk from the Prophet (s) and thus it was permissible at that time, but after he (a) passed away, seeking tabarruk from him would only be possible through what has touched his body. These people have mentioned two reasons to justify their opinion: Tabarruk signifies polytheism and is similar to the acts of idol-worshippers and an example of polytheism. On the other hand, there is no support for its admissibility in the tradition. [44] This kind of tabarruk is making bid'a : because tabarruk is an act of worship and it is a rule that acts of worship are exclusiveness; therefore, naming an act as an act of worship, without having any background in the conduct of the companions of the Prophet (s) is regarded as bid'a [unauthentic new practice] and bid'a is haram . [45] Therefore, touching and seeking tabarruk from the doors and walls of al-Masjid al-Nabawi , [46] al-Masjid al-Haram , the two rukns of Ka'ba , Hajar al-Aswad , walls of Ka'ba, and Maqam Ibrahim (a) (Abraham's (a) Station), the Rock in Jerusalem , and the graves of prophets and righteous people. [47] Second Opinion Some others believe that seeking tabarruk has only been permissible about the Prophet (s) and only when he (s) was alive and thus after he (s) passed away, seeking tabarruk is not permissible even to parts of his body whatever belonged to him. These people say that companions ' seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) has been because God assigned him as the Wali (guardian) over believers and since his guardianship is limited to when he was alive and after he (s) passed away, there was no guardianship then seeking tabarruk is not allowed anymore. Third Opinion Some others believe that seeking tabarruk has only been permissible from the Prophet (s) and God has only bestowed blessings in the Prophet's (a) body, then seeking tabarruk from people other than him is not permissible at all. These people say that Sahaba and Tabi'un avoided seeking tabarruk from anyone or anything other than the Prophet (s) and his belongings, since they wanted to avoid involving in polytheism or exaggeration . Criticism and Analysis of Wahhabis' Opinion Discussing the First Opinion Analyzing the first reason: there are several weak points and problems about considering tabarruk as an act of polytheism. Acts of worship are practices performed intended to worship God; but, when a person seeks tabarruk from what belongs to great people in religion , he never means to consider a divine position for them and has no intention of worship in seeking tabarruk; therefore, his act is not an act of worship to have disagreement with monotheism in worship or to be exaggerating . The proof for this claim is that it was practiced several times before the Prophet (s) and he neither prohibited that, nor called it polytheistic, while he did prohibit anyone who said something exaggerating or polytheistic. Revering prophets and friends of God and what belongs to them is an example of venerating signs of the Divine and has been admired by the Qur'an and the companions' prudence in cases of seeking tabarruk shows that they also wanted to revere that person as well; cases such as putting the soil of the Prophet's (a) grave on the eye or his hair by Ahmad b. Hanbal and also al-Shafi'i 's prohibition of people riding horses on the ground of Medina which is where the Prophet (s) walked, proves the mentioned claim. Not only there is no prohibition ever mentioned for venerating graves of the Prophet (s) and friends of God, even there are some permissions mentioned for it. Ahmad b. Hanbal's fatwa [52] which Ibn Taymiyya has also been aware of [53] and the conduct of great Shi'a and Sunni scholars in permitting veneration of the Prophet's (a) grave, al-Rawdat al-Nabawi and his pulpit and seeking tabarruk form them proves the wrongness of any prohibition in that regard. Also, wills of the First and Second Caliphs for burying them beside the Prophet's (a) grave [54] has only been out of seeking tabarruk from his grave [55] and this is another reason for permissibility of seeking tabarruk from the Prophet's (s) grave. There have been issued some problems considering tabarruk as Bid'a for which the following answers are given: With several reasons mentioned for permissibility of this act, it cannot be considered as signifying an act of Bid'a. If this act or any certain type of it is considered a new act which has no history at the time of the Prophet (s), still not any new act is bad and forbidden while bid'a is actually a new act which is introduced in religion and we have no reason for its legitimacy. On the contrary, tabarruk cannot be considered bid'a since there are several reasons and evidences for the conduct of Muslims to support it; and even according to al-Shafi'i, it is a recommended practice. Also, in those cases for which there is no clearly mentioned permission for it, the principle of Ibaha can be referred to according to which whatever action for which we have no reason for its prohibition is permissible and legitimate. Discussing the Second Opinion It is not right since: The Prophet (s) has been living in barzakh (the world after this world and before the hereafter ) [56] and thus his Wilaya (guardianship) is not limited to his life in this world and has continued after his life in this world. [57] Historical evidences show that seeking tabarruk has always been practiced by his companions and the followers after he (s) passed on. [58] Discussing the Third Opinion This opinion is not right either since: Seeking tabarruk has not been practiced only about the Prophet (s) and it is permissible to be practiced about righteous people as well; some cases of which practiced about companions and followers will be mentioned later. That the Prophet (s) or his companions did not do an action, it is not a reason for prohibition of that. Reasons and Evidences for Permissibility of Tabarruk In Qur'an The Glorious Qur'an has referred to tabarruk in some verses and has not mentioned it either prohibited or permissible. Moreover, some these cases are practiced either by prophets themselves or at their presence which clearly shows its permissibility. Prophet Jacob (a) sought tabarruk from Joseph's (a) shirt which is mentioned in the Qur'an. When Joseph (a) told his brothers to put his shirt on the eyes of their father, \"Take this shirt of mine, and cast it upon my father's face; he will regain his sight…\" ( Qur'an 12 :93) then God's mercy flew from Joseph's shirt to the eyes of Jacob (a) [59] and he sought tabarruk from it and regained his sight. Another example is that people of Moses (a) sought tabarruk from ark of covenant , which held belongings of the family of Moses (a) and Aaron (a) and the holy Tablets which were descended to Moses (a) and he trusted them to Joshua b. Nun . [60] People of Moses (a) regarded the ark of covenant very holy and carried it with themselves in wars with idol-worshippers and it was bearing tranquility for them. [61] It is mentioned in Qur'an, \"Their prophet said to them, 'Indeed the sign of his kingship shall be that the Ark will come to you, bearing tranquility from your Lord and the relics left behind by the House of Moses (a) and the House of Aaron(a), borne by the angels …\" ( Qur'an 2 :248) and they sought tabarruk from it. [62] Beside tabarruk, this act can also be an example of veneration which does not have any conflict with tabarruk; while actually, carrying the ark of covenant especially at the time of war could not have any purpose other than seeking tabarruk and help from it. [63] Maqam Ibrahim (a) (Station of Abraham) near Ka'ba , on which footprint of Abraham (a) can be seen, has been chosen for the place people pray, [64] \"And [remember] when We made the House a place of reward for mankind and a sanctuary, [declaring], 'Take the venue of prayer from Abraham's Station.' …\" ( Qur'an 2 :125) and people seek tabarruk from that stone because of that footprint [65] and therefore, seeking tabarruk from the seat of the Prophet (s) and the place of his prayer are permissible. [66] In a hadith, the place between al-Hajar al-Aswad and Abraham's (a) station has been introduced as the place many prophets have been buried and therefore it is blessed. [67] Conduct of the Prophet (s) Conduct of the Prophet (s) is a support for permissibility of seeking tabarruk. Some hadiths suggest that he (s) used to encourage his companions to seek tabarruk from him. Shi'a and Sunni historical and hadith texts have mentioned many such cases. For example, it is mentioned that he (s) told his companions to seek tabarruk from the well of the She-Camel of prophet Salih (a) and this is a permission for seeking tabarruk from whatever belongs or is attributed to prophets and righteous people even if they have passed on. On the night of Lady Fatima's (a) marriage, the noble Prophet (s) performed wudu and sprinkled the rest of the water of his wudu on the faces of Lady Fatima (a) and 'Ali (a) and asked God to bless them and their progeny. In a hadith, Imam 'Ali (a) says that for the blessings of the Prophet's (a) touch on his eyes which were very much in pain in the Battle of Khaybar , he (a) never felt sore eyes again. In another narration, it is mentioned that the Prophet (s) sprinkled the water of his wudu on a sick person and he was healed. In some narrations, it is mentioned that after performing hajj rituals , he (s) cut his hair ( Taqsir ) and Muslims shared out his hair among themselves. On the Night of Mi'raj , the Prophet (s) prayed where other prophets had prayed. Those prayers could not have any purpose other than that those places had been blessed by those prophets. In the process of burying Fatima bt. Asad , Imam 'Ali's (a) mother, the Prophet (s) shrouded her with his own clothes and before burying her, he laid in her grave for some moments so that the hardships of the grave become easy for her. 'Abd Allah b. Ubay asked the Prophet (s) to be buried in the Prophet's (a) clothes and this way he sought tabarruk from it to be forgiven and do not receive divine punishment. In the process of the treaty of Hudaybiyya , the delegate of Quraysh narrates that the companions of the Prophet (s) did not let even one drop of the water of his wudu drops on the ground and washed their faces with them. This happened before the Prophet (s) and he (s) did not prohibited them from doing it, therefore, it can be considered as an evidence for permissibility of seeking tabarruk. Even some other times, he (s) himself would tell the companions to seek tabarruk from the water of his wudu. Conduct of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) In historical texts, there are many cases of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) . After the Prophet (s) passed on, Fatima al-Zahra (a) visited his grave and rubbed the soil of his grave on her face. [78] Seeking tabarruk from the grave of the Prophet (s) was a permanent conduct of the Ahl al-Bayt (a). In hadith references, Seeking tabarruk from the grave of the Prophet (s) has been reported to be practiced by Imam al-Husayn (a) , [79] Imam al-Sadiq (a) , [80] Imam al-Rida (a) , [81] and Imam al-Jawad (a) . [82] Imam al-Hasan (a) made a will to be buried beside the Prophet (s) in case it does not become a point of dispute. [83] Other evidences of this conduct are seeking tabarruk to the Prophet's (a) walking stick by Imam al-Sadiq (a) [84] and also seeking tabarruk to remnants of the Prophet's (a) Hanut (camphor applied to one's corpse) by Imam 'Ali (a). [85] Conduct of the Companions and the Followers Both at the time of the Prophet (s) and also after he passed on, the companions sought tabarruk from him. Studying the lives of the Prophet (s) and his companions show that early Muslims sought tabarruk from him and what belonged to him. Seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) was for two reasons: both for achieving spiritual benefits from him and for showing him and his Ahl al-Bayt (a) respect and love. Since, respecting prophets and friend of God and what belong to them is an example of venerating signs of the Divine and the caution of the companions in cases of seeking tabarruk shows that as well as seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) himself, they also wanted to esteem and venerate those great people and show great love to them. Muslims' seeking tabarruk from the Prophet (s) was in three ways: Seeking tabarruk from the Prophet's (a) body, from what belonged to him, and from the places related to him. From the Prophet's (s) Body The Prophet's (a) companions kept his hair with themselves to seek tabarruk from. It is mentioned in historical reports and hadith references that in the process of the Treaty of Hudaybiyya , the Prophet (s) was cutting his hair, his companions gathered around him and picked every hair of the Prophet (s) which fell and kept with themselves to seek tabarruk from. Khalid b. Walid sought tabarruk from a headband which had some hair of the Prophet (s) on it and put it on in battles to gain victory. Seeking tabarruk from his sweat is another type of seeking tabarruk which is reported to have been practiced by his companions including Anas b. Malik and Umm Salim. There are also reports about blessing the water of the well of Hudaybiyya by remnants of his drinking water and also seeking tabarruk from the water of his wudu . Also in a report, it is mentioned that people cut the spout of a leather bottle from which the Prophet (s) drank water and kept it for themselves to seek tabarruk from it. In historical references, a list of twenty springs and well is mentioned which were blessed by the Prophet (s) and companions sought tabarruk from them frequently. From the Prophet's (s) Belongings What belonged to the Prophet (s) such as his walking stick, clothes, cloak, turban, shoes, prayer mat, handle of his sword, flag, and his bed were sought tabarruk from. From the Places Related to the Prophet (s) Early Muslims paid so much attention to the places which were somehow related with the Prophet (s) ; whether he (s) had prayed there, or sat there for a while and even passed by. A list of such places was reported by al-Fakihi in the 3rd/9th century titled as al-Mawadi' al-llati dakhalaha Rasul Allah (a) . 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar was among those who paid so much attention to places related to the Prophet (s). His attention especially towards seeking tabarruk from those places which suggests that it has been a common practice in the early Islamic history has been so much that some opposers of seeking tabarruk tried to justify 'Abd Allah's attention and practice and said that it has been a result of 'Abd Allah's own personal judgment not a result of religious proofs. However, some people refer to these hadiths and conclude that following what belonged to the Prophet (s) is recommended . Some of such places as mentioned above which were located in Mecca are: The Prophet's (a) birthplace, [110] Where he (s) sacrificed a camel after hajj rituals , [111] The place the Bay'a [allegiance] of Ridwan took place, [112] The cave where the Prophet's (s) immigration began, [113] Masjid al-Ghanam which was the place where people of Mecca paid allegiance with the Prophet (s) after the Conquest of Mecca , [114] Masjid al-Khif where the Prophet (s) made the sermon of Hajjat al-Wida' [115] and 700 prophets prayed and is very much recommended to be prayed in, [116] Masjid Radm al-A'la , Masjid al-Mukhtafi , House of Umm Hani , Masjid 'Urayd , [117] House of lady Khadija (a) where lady Fatima (a) was born, [118] House of Arqam b. Abi Arqam where Muslims hided from Meccan polytheists, [119] Masjid al-Ghadir where the Prophet (s) made the sermon of Ghadir , [120] The rock near Qubbat al-Wahy in al-Masjid al-Haram and it is said that greeted the Prophet (s), [121] The rock near Mecca which is said that in return from 'Umra , the Prophet (s) took rest on, [122] The stone on the corner of al-Masjid al-Haram on which the footprint of the Prophet (s) is made on it. [123] Holy sites in Medina including: The Prophet's (a) pulpit and al-Rawdat al-Nabawi , where reciting supplications is considered among religious manners agreed by all Muslims and Muslims used to pick the soil of his grave to seek tabarruk from. This became so common among Muslims which 'Aisha ordered to build a wall against the Prophet's (a) grave. Thawr and Hira' Caves, al-Shajara Mosque where the Prophet (s) put on Ihram , Masjid al-Ijaba where in return from 'Umra, the Prophet (s) prayed, Masjid al-Baghla and Masjid al-Fath , Quba Mosque for praying in which one receives great lot of rewards. From People Other than the Prophet (s) Muslims sought tabarruk from people other than the Prophet (s) as well. They did so during the Islamic history since the time of the Prophet (s) until now; for example, it is reported that the Prophet (s) sought tabarruk from the sweat on the forehead of Imam 'Ali (a) . Seeking tabarruk from the graves of other prophets and righteous people have been a common practice among Islamic scholars and Muslims. Some other cases of seeking tabarruk from other than the Prophet (s) are: The Glorious Qur'an and al-Hajar al-Aswad , Flag of Imam al-Hasan (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) , Sword of Ja'far al-Tayyar , The Qur'an attributed to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , Kiswah (curtain of Ka'ba ), Remnants of Ahl al-Bayt's (a) food, Mus'ab b. Zubayr seeking tabarruk from Imam al-Husayn (a), 'Umar b. al-Khattab seeking tabarruk from al-'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib , Al-'Abbas seeking tabarruk from 'Ali (a), Remaining of the food or water of a believer contains cure, Water of the Euphrates river Water of Zamzam , Soil of Medina , Crown of Uways al-Qarani , Sword of Khalid b. Walid , Sword of Shurahbil b. Hasana, House of lady Fatima (a) , House of 'Aqil b. Abi Talib Great Mosque of Kufa . From the Graves of the Friends of God and Righteous People Seeking tabarruk from the graves has not been excluded to the grave of the Prophet (s) , and Muslims used to seek tabarruk from the graves of the companions , the followers and righteous people as well. Al-Subki believes that, according to religion and conduct of the righteous disciples of the Prophet (s), seeking tabarruk even from some righteous people who have passed on is also permissible. Some examples of seeking tabarruk practiced by the companions are from: Turba [Soil of the grave] of Imam al-Husayn (a) , Turba of Imam 'Ali b. Musa al-Rida (a) , [141] Turba of Imam Musa b. Ja'far (a) , [142] Grave of Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib in Uhud Cemetery , [143] Grave of Bilal al-Habashi in Syria , [144] Grave of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari in Istanbul , [145] Grave of Sayyida Nafisa in Egypt . [146] Also, there is a place in 'Asqalan called Maqam Ra's al-Husayn (a) which has sepulcher and mosque and it is said that the head of Imam al-Husayn (a) is buried there and thus local people seek tabarruk from it.

{"title": "Day of Encounter", "text": "Day of Encounter or Yawm al-Talāq (Arabic: یَوْم التَّلاق ) is a term referring to the day of resurrection . The term is used once in the Qur'an , and different interpretations have been provided for what is meant thereby. In the Qur'an The term is used once in the Qur'an in Sura al-Ghafir verse 15: “ رَفِيعُ الدَّرَجَاتِ ذُو الْعَرْشِ يُلْقِي الرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ لِيُنذِرَ يَوْمَ التَّلَاقِ \"Raiser of ranks, Lord of the Throne, He casts the Spirit of His command upon whomever of His servants that He wishes, that he may warn [people] of the Day of Encounter.\" ” — Qur'an, 40:15. Meaning of \"Talaq\" \"Talaq\" literally means an encounter or meeting. Different interpretations have been proposed for \"talaq\" in the above verse: There is a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) according to which \"Yawm al-Talaq\" is a day in which inhabitants of the sky and the Earth will meet. [2] Al-Shaykh al-Mufid takes \"Yawm al-Talaq\" to mean the meeting of the soul and the body on the day of resurrection. It seems that he has the physical resurrection in mind.

{"title": "Tawassul", "text": " Tawassul , (Arabic: توسّل ) is one of the beliefs of Shi'a and most Muslims which means to resort to someone or something with a high position as an intermediary before God in order to become closer to Him so that He may fulfill one's requests. The concept of Tawassul is closely related to the concept of Shafa'a (intercession) and they are often mentioned together. Resorting to the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) as an intermediary is among the prominent beliefs of Shi'a due to God's order in the Qur'an and many hadiths of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . It is mentioned in Shi'a supplications and ziyarah of the Infallible Ones (a), the most comprehensive one of which is Al-Tawassul Supplication . In the contemporary period, following Ibn Taymiyya , Wahhabis have mentioned criticisms about Tawassul which have been rejected by all Shi'a and most Sunni scholars. Meaning Tawassul is an infinitive from the root of \"w-s-l\" meaning to do something in order to become close to someone or something. In the technical sense of the term, it means to benefit from the good and righteous people close to God in order for supplications to be fulfilled. Through resorting, upon supplication , one presents something before God that is the means of acceptance of his repentance and fulfillment of supplication. The object of resorting is the person or thing that is respectable before God; such as God's attributes or names, the name of The the Holy Prophet (s) , his supplication, the name of great friends of God and angels and the request can be a religious and spiritual issue or a material or worldly need. \"Wasila\" (Arabic: وسیلة , means) is what or whom is benefited by one to become close to God. Thus, as it is mentioned in Shi'a narrations, Wasila can refer to a wide range of means which can include religious obligations and recommended actions, the supplications of the faithful and even the friends of God. Arguments for Tawassul To prove the legitimacy of Tawassul, researchers have referred to different evidences from the Qur'an, hadith and sira. Some also believe that, in addition to its legitimacy and desirability according to shari'a, Tawassul is rooted in human's nature and rationality. In the Qur'an The concept of Tawassul and resorting to a means is adopted from the Qur'an . The clearest reference to Tawassul is mentioned in Sura al-Ma'ida where God clearly orders the faithful to benefit from the means in order to become close to God. “ O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah , and seek the means of recourse to Him, and wage jihad in His way, so that you may be felicitous. ” — The Qur'an , 5:35 Also, in verse 64 of the Sura al-Nisa' , sinners are advised that they come to the Prophet (s) and ask him to ask God for their forgiveness so that God forgive them. “ And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, [O Muhammad], and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful. ” — The Qur'an , 4:64 Also, when Prophet Joseph's (a) brothers became regretful, instead of asking God for forgiveness, asked their father's intercession and asked him to ask God for their forgiveness. “ They said, \"O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners. ” — The Qur'an , 12:97 Also, in another verse, servants are required to hold fast, all together, to Allah's cord. In this verse, according to Shi'a narrations, by \"Allah's cord\", the Ahl al-Bayt (a) of the Prophet (s) are meant. “ Hold fast, all together, to Allah's cord, and do not be divided [into sects]. ” — The Qur'an , 3:103 In Hadiths There are many hadiths about Tawassul, where the meaning of Tawassul, the examples of Wasila and its fruits are explained. In a hadith from Lady Fatima (a) , it is mentioned that, \"Everything in the sky and on the earth seek a Wasila [means] through which they become close to God and we are God's means and intermediaries among His creation.\" [5] Imam al-Sadiq (a) has said that, \"We ( Ahl al-Bayt (a) ) are the Allah's cord about which God Almighty has said, \"Hold fast, all together, to Allah's cord, and do not be divided [into sects].\" (3:103) [6] Also according to hadiths, after Prophet Adam (a) was dismissed from the Paradise , he (a) was forgiven by God through resorting to the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). [7] Previous prophets (a) resorted to the position of the Prophet (s) as well. [8] In a hadith, Imam 'Ali (a) has mentioned the examples of Wasila; among which are belief in God, Jihad in the way of God and doing the obligations, fasting , hajj and 'Umra . [9] In addition to hadiths, Ziyarah texts [addresses given upon visiting shrines] and supplications received from the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are full of the instances of Tawassul and swearing in the rights of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) which are examples of Tawassul. [10] Hadiths regarding permissibility of practicing Tawassul are not only narrated by Shi'a but also narrated by Sunnis ; including the one in which, a blind man regained his sight through Tawassul to the Prophet (s), or another hadith that Aisha has narrated from the Prophet (s) saying that \"Imam Ali (a) is the closest Wasila to God.\" Conduct of Muslims Conduct of Muslims of early Islam and the companions of the Prophet (s) show that resorting to the righteous and virtuous is an acceptable and desirable action. In this regard, some examples can be mentioned as below: 'Umar 's Entreaty to 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib upon asking for rain. [13] Safiyya 's entreaty to the Prophet (s) by composing elegies for him. [14] A man's entreaty to the Prophet (s) at the time of 'Uthman by the guidance of 'Uthman b. Hunayf [15] and resorting of Bilal b. Harith to the Prophet (s) to ask for rain. [16] According to the Zayni Dahlan, studying the supplications of the people of the past shows many examples of their entreaties. [17] Ibn Hajar al-Haytami has mentioned some poems of Shafi'i in which the household of the Prophet (s) have openly been introduced as the means to reach near God. [18] According to a narration, in a conversation with Mansur Dawaniqi , Malik b. Anas taught him the way of visiting the grave of the noble Prophet (s) and resort to him. [19] Kinds of Wasila One cannot use any means to become close to God, e.g. for this purpose, using fire or idol is forbidden because Islam's permission to use fire as Wasila is not proved and also prohibition of using idols is proved in religion. However, to know what are considered as Wasila, one needs to refer to hadiths and traditions. Here, there can be a categorization of Tawassul to legitimate and illegitimate, since if one uses a Wasila which is not approved by God to become close to God, he suffers from illegitimate Tawassul; even when making Tawassul to other than idols cannot be considered as polytheism . Some of the issues which have been mentioned as Wasila to become close to God in narrations of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) are as follows: Belief in One God and the Prophet (s) Jihad in the way of God Ikhlas (Sincerity) Establishing the Prayer Paying Zakat Fasting the month of Ramadan Hajj and 'Umra Caring for one's kin Giving charity , covertly and overtly The Qur'an God's names and attributes Making Tawassul to the faithful's prayers and du'as Making Tawassul to the Prophet's (s) du'as Making Tawassul to the Prophet (s) himself, Infallible Imams (a) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a) Good and righteous deeds Wahhabi's Questions Tawassul is approved by most Muslims , whether Shi'a or Sunni ; Wahhabis have denied and criticized Tawassul; some of their critics are as follow: Tawassul and Tawhid The first criticism Wahhabis make about Tawassul is that Tawassul contradicts the unity of God because the servant should only ask God for help and asking other than God is polytheism . To prove illegitimacy of Tawassul, Ibn Taymiyya has sometimes referred to verses of the Qur'an , including verses 56 and 57 of Sura al-Isra' : “ Say, Invoke those whom you claim [to be gods] besides Him. They have no power to remove your distress nor to bring about any change [in your state]. They [themselves] are the ones who supplicate, seeking a recourse to their Lord, whoever is nearer [to Him], expecting His mercy and fearing His punishment. Indeed your Lord's punishment is a thing to beware of. ” — Qur'an 17 :56-57 and “ You [alone] do we worship, and to You [alone] do we turn for help. ” — Qur'an 1 :5 However, looking carefully, one finds no relation between these verses and Tawassul, since they are about rejection of the lordship of the polytheists' gods and their incompetence for being worshiped and they have no relation with resorting to holy means in order to become close to God. Also, verse 5 of the Sura al-Fatiha rejects asking help from other than God, believing in the means independently, not rejecting asking God through the means; just like in the noble Qur'an, seeking helps from the prayer and other things are mentioned. Intellectually, making Tawassul never requires polytheism; since firstly, asking help from someone or something does not mean worshiping that person or thing. The system of creation is based on the mutual effects of things and means over each other and of course, they receive their effects from God and none of them can make any influence independently. Since, seeking help from material means and people is not polytheism as we do not believe in their independence, using non-material means, if we believe in their dependence, would not be polytheism. Believing in the unity of God requires that while one benefits from the means, he is aware about their origins and dependence to God of the world and this is the belief in the unity of God. In addition to above references, some other verses of the Qur'an have been referred to for justifying the impermissibility of Tawassul including verse 3 of Sura al-Zumar : “ Look! [Only] exclusive faith is worthy of Allah, and those who take guardians besides Him [claiming,] 'We only worship them so that they may bring us near to Allah,' Allah will indeed judge between them concerning that about which they differ. Indeed Allah does not guide someone who is a liar and an ingrate. ” — Qur'an 39 :3 And verse 37 of Sura Saba' : “ It is not your wealth, nor your children, that will bring you close to Us in nearness, except those who have faith and act righteously. It is they for whom there will be a twofold reward for what they did, and they will be secure in lofty abodes. ” — Qur'an 34 :37 But the first verse (39:3), only rejects worshiping anything other than God, not becoming close to God through resorting to the righteous without being worshiped. About the second verse (34:37), resorting to the Prophets (a) and friends of God is mentioned among righteous deeds. Making Tawassul to the Prophet (s) after his Demise Ibn Taymiyya said that benefiting from du'as of the Prophet (s) and the righteous is permissible only during their lifetimes and after they pass away, they cannot do anything and resoring to them is not permissible. However, this idea of Ibn Taymiyya contradicts with the Islamic idea of life after death . The life of prophets (a) and the friends of God continues after they move on to the world of Barzakh (middle world). It is obvious that the prophets (a), who have higher positions than the martyrs , will continue their lives after this world. Moreover, from the Islamic viewpoint, death is not the end and destruction of human being, but moving from one world to another. The same as one can ask the Prophet (s) to make du'a and ask God for the person's forgiveness during his lifetime, he (s) can be asked for the same request after he (a) has passed away; since, according to the Qur'an and traditions, connection between one living in this world and souls of the people in Barzakh is possible. The dialogues between the two prophets Salih (a) and Shu'ayb (a) with their perished people, the fact that God orders His Prophet (s) in the Qur'an to speak with the previous prophets (a), and the conversation of the Prophet (s) and Imam 'Ali (a) with those who were killed in the battles of Badr and Jamal are evidences for the above claim. Tawassul and Bid'a Considering Tawassul as Bid'a (impermissible innovation) is a claim of Ibn Taymiyya and Wahhabis. From the viewpoint of the school of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and with the many authentic hadiths , du'as and ziyarahs narrated from the Infallibles (a) about making Tawassul to the position of them, it is obvious that the claim of Wahhabis and Ibn Taymiyya is not plausible. Moreover, studying the conducts of Muslims and even non-Shi'ites proves that after the demise of the Prophet (s) , they did make Tawassul to the noble Prophet (s) the same as they made Tawassul to his du'as during his lifetime; about which there are stories mentioned about Imam 'Ali (a) and Abu Bakr . Accordingly, the following stories can be mentioned: 'Umar 's resorting 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib to perform the prayer for raining ( Istisqa' ), the Prophet's (s) aunt, Safiyya 's resorting to him by reciting some poems in his demise, a man's resorting to the Prophet (s) at the time of 'Uthman 's caliphate using 'Uthman b. Hunayf 's advice and Bilal b. Harith 's resorting to the Prophet (s) to pray for raining. According to Zayni Dahlan , studying du'as and prayers of Muslims in the past, shows many of their cases of Tawassul. Al-Haythami has mentioned some poems of Shafi'i in which the Ahl al-Bayt (a) have clearly been mentioned as the means to become close to God. According to a report, in a conversation between Malik b. Anas and al-Mansur al-Dawaniqi , Malik b. Anas taught al-Mansur how to visit the grave of the noble Prophet (s) and make Tawassul to him. Even if the authenticity of some Sunni narrations about Tawassul is not proved, many of them show that such practice of Tawassul has been common since the time of the Companions and later periods and has been regarded as an authentic principle. Al-Samhudi tells different stories about those who made Tawassul to the Prophet (s) near his shrine and their requests were answered. Manner of Tawassul in Ziyarahs and Du'as Studying Tawassul and the literature used for it in du'as and Ziyarahs narrated from the Imams (a) helps an authentic understanding of the permissible Tawassul. Making Tawassul to the Imams (a) and the friends of God exists almost in all Shi'a du'as and Ziyarahs of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a). Also, especial prayers are mentioned to make Tawassul to the Prophet (s) or each of the Imams (a) in the books of supplications, the most important one of which is al-Tawassul supplication , some phrases of which are as follows: O God, I ask You and turn towards You through Your Prophet (s) of mercy O Prophet of Allah (s), … We turn to and ask for Shafa'a from God through you and place you before our requests, O the one, who is honored before God, Make Shafa'a for us before God! To swear God in the rights of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) and the righteous is one of the permissible ways of Tawassul; such as saying, \"O Allah, I ask You in the position of Muhammad\" or \"O Allah, I surly ask You in the rights of all the faithful who praised him in it.\" In Shi'a Culture Although Tawassul is accepted among all Muslims , but due to its special position in Shi'a culture, special manners and rituals have been associated with it. Some of such rituals are: visiting the graves of Imams (a) and the righteous, spreading food tables in the name of Imams (a) such as the table of Imam Zayn al-'Abidin (a) or the table of Abu al-Fadl (a) when in a session, people are given food and they recite the Qur'an and du'as and present its rewards to that Imam (a) and make Tawassul to him. Holding gatherings to recite Du'a al-Tawassul in congregation is another common ritual among Shi'a which is usually held in the eve of Wednesdays in mosques , shrines of Imams (a) and even in houses.

{"title": "Ziyara", "text": "Ziyāra (Arabic: الزيارة ; visit) or pilgrimage is a religious act which means to attend before religious leaders or their graves in order to express and show love and reverence and acquire spiritual blessings. Visiting religious personalities and their graves have always been among recommended acts in Islam and during history, Muslims have paid attention to it and followed it. However, ziyara of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) has had a great importance among Shi'a and many spiritual benefits and rewards have been mentioned for them. Since ziyara is greatly important in Shi'a culture, it has been regarded among the characteristics of Shi'a. Despite the general opinion of Muslims about recommendation and permissibility of Ziyara, Wahhabism , which has certain interpretations of some verses , claims that ziyara is not compatible with the conduct of the Prophet (s) and has cast doubts on this issue. These doubts have made Shi'a and Sunni scholars answer and defend the permissibility of Ziyara. Meaning Literally, the word \"Ziyara\" means turning and withdrawing from something. The person who goes on ziyara is called Za'ir because when he goes to ziyara of a person, turns away from others. The common meaning of ziyara is that one turns to a person to show respect and become close to him; i.e. a visit which is accompanied with reverence at the heart and spiritual approach. Also, some have said that visiting friends of God and great Muslim personalities is called ziyara because it is turning away from material world towards the spiritual world. Importance in Islamic Culture In Islamic culture and all Muslims' tradition, ziyara has an important position which can be understood from hadiths received from Imams (a) about the promised rewards for ziyara. Hadiths about recommendation of ziyara of the Prophet (s) are many and at the level of Tawatur [high frequency of narration] and agreed upon by both Shi'as and Sunnis . Therefore, Muslims go to ziyara of the grave of the Prophet (s) since long ago. Although ziyara of the graves of the righteous especially the Prophet (s) is accepted by all Muslims, the concept of ziyara is more important in Shi'a culture. In addition to ziyara of the Prophet (s), ziyara of infallible Imams (a) is also a part of Shi'a rituals and is very important to them. In Shi'a Culture In Shi'a culture, ziyara means the connection with the infallible Imam (a) and admitting his Wilaya , ziyara has a tight relation with the issue of the love of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) , Tawalli [Loving] and Tabarri [disassociation]. Ziyara of the Infallible (a) is among the signs and requirements of loyalty towards them and doing justice to their rights of Wilaya over their followers; since, in the view of Shi'a, the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) have Wilaya and even after they pass away, their positions are preserved. One of the fruits of Imam's Wilaya is his control over the hearts, meaning that Imam has control over souls and hearts of people. In most ziyara texts, such a Wilaya and Imama is admitted; for example, it is mentioned in texts for ziyara of Imams (a), \"I attest that you see my place and hear my word and answer my salutation.\" In Shi'a view, the soul of Imam becomes aware about his visitor with God's permission and this has made ziyara for Shi'a a meeting filled with love and spirituality, the influence of which can obviously be seen in Shi'a prose and poetry. Ziyarah and the holy shrines of the Ahl al-Bayt (a) have had great roles in Shi'a history and paying great attention to these is considered among significant cultural symbols of Shi'a. In Sunni Culture Many hadiths and historical reports can be found in Sunni sources about ziyara of sahaba which indicate that ziyara is accepted and recommended among Sunni Muslims. In numerous books such as Sahih Muslim and Sunan Abi Dawud, it has been narrated from the Holy Prophet (s) that:\"In the past, I forbade you from ziyara of the graves, but make ziyara of them now (because it will remind you of the hereafter and their ziyara will add to your good so anyone who wants to make ziyara then it is allowed but do not utter useless and false statements). Types Different types of ziyara have been mentioned in hadiths from the Ahl al-Bayt (a); some of which are: Visiting Ka'ba : which is performing Hajj , 'Umra or circumambulation ( Tawaf ) of Ka'ba. [3] Recommendation of ziyara of Ka'ba and obligation of Hajj is among definite rulings agreed by all Muslims. Furthermore, according to hadiths, Ka'ba has been also respected by all prophets of the past. [4] Ziyara of the Prophet (s) , which would be rewarded both during his lifetime and after he (s) passed away. [5] Permissibility and recommendation of his ziyara is accepted by both Shi'a and Sunni and many hadiths have been narrated about that. Imam al-Sadiq (a) narrated from the Prophet (s) that anyone who comes to visit me, I will intercede for him on the Day of Judgment . [6] Also, in another hadith, it is narrated that ziyara of the grave of the Prophet (s), graves of martyrs and the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) equals to performing Hajj in the company of the Prophet (s). [7] Ziyara of Amir al-Mu'minin , 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) in Najaf , for which great rewards are promised in hadiths; for example, Imam al-Husayn (a) narrated from the Prophet (s) that, \"anyone who visits me or 'Ali (a), I will visit him on the Day of Judgment and I will free him from his sins.\" [8] According to hadiths, Imam 'Ali (a) is superior to all Imams (a) and there are many hadiths regarding his Ziyara. Also about ziyara of Lady Fatima al-Zahra (a) , whose grave is unknown, her ziyara can be done from distance. Ziyara of Imam al-Husayn (a) in Karbala ; about which different and great rewards have been mentioned in correspondence with the visitor's knowledge and the manner of his Ziyara. [10] Ziyara of other Imams (a) . It is narrated from Imam al-Sadiq (a) that ziyara of each of Imams (a) will be rewarded the same as the ziyarah of the Prophet (s). [11] Ziyara of Imams (a) from distance; if anyone is unable to go to ziyara of the Prophet (s), Imams (a) or Lady Fatima (s), he can make ziyara from distance. [12] Ziyara of Lady Fatima al-Ma'suma (a) , the honorable daughter of Imam al-Kazim (a) in Qom ; there are many hadiths about her virtues and it is narrated from Imam al-Rida (a) that the rewards for ziyara of Lady Ma'suma (s) is the paradise . [13] Ziyara of 'Abd al-'Azim al-Hasani in Rey ; he (a) was among the great children of Imam al-Hasan al-Mujtaba (a) and great companions of Imams (a). In a hadith, the rewards promised for ziyarah of him has been mentioned the same as ziyara of Imam al-Husayn (a). [14] Ziyara of faithful and righteous people: In many hadiths, ziyara of the graves of the faithful and making Du'a for them have been recommended; such as in a hadith narrated from Imam 'Ali (a) which advises that visit your passed ones since they become happy from your visit and make your requests from God near the graves of your father and mother. [15] Manners The heart of ziyara is the spiritual attention towards Imam and showing respect, greetings, and making a spiritual bond with him. However, since Ziyara is considered as going before Imam (a), certain instructions are given for it, following which increases the benefits one can receive from Ziyara. Certain instructions are given for the ziyarah of some Imams (a) such as the Prophet (s) or Imam al-Husayn (a). For example, there are certain Du'as and manners recommended to be observed during the ziyara of the Prophet (s), and ziyara of Imam al-Husayn (a) on the day of 'Arafa will have more rewards; or ziyara of Imam al-Rida (a) in the months of Dhu l-Qa'da and Rajab has been recommended. Some common manners of ziyara are: To make ziyara with knowledge; according to many hadiths, the full reward of ziyara would be given to those who do it being aware and having knowledge about the position of Imam (a) ('Arif bi-haqqih [knowing his rights]). Although having knowledge has different levels, but the minimum degree of that is that the visitor knows that he is visiting an infallible Imam (a) who has Wilaya , whose obedience is obligatory , that he (a) is the successor of the Prophet (s) and that the visitor needs to admit to Imam's (a) rights and obey his orders. To explain what it means to be aware and to have knowledge about the rights of Imam, Imam al-Kazim (a) said, \"It is to know that his obedience is obligatory and that he is Gharib [left in distance without help] and martyred.\" [17] To do ghusl (ritual bath) for Ziyara [18] To make Wudu [ablution] and be pure Wearing new and clean clothes Wearing perfume (except for ziyara of Imam al-Husayn (a), for which wearing perfume is not recommended) Avoiding idle talk Reciting Idhn Dukhul [permission for entrance] Going near the grave, so that the visitor reaches Darih and hang on it, provided that he does not disturb other visitors. (However, ziyara of Imams (a) is not only touching and kissing Darih; but the visitor can receive the full rewards of ziyara without touching Darih, only by reciting ziyara text and saluting those honorable ones; and the idea that if a person does not reach Darih or kiss it, his ziyara would be incomplete, is wrong.) Reciting Ziyara texts received from Imams (a) , such as the Ziyarat Amin Allah and al-Jami'a al-Kabira . Not speaking loudly and reciting du'a in a low tone Doing two rak'as of prayer and gifting its reward to the one buried in the grave Reciting du'a and the Qur'an and gifting its reward to the one buried in the grave Kissing the doorstep [however prostrating ( Sujud ) for the Darih is not permissible] Making repentance ( Tawba ), because such places are the place of acceptance of repentance Leaving the shrine (especially from around Darih) after ziyara to empty room for others to make ziyara and also not become tired of ziyara and to keep the love of ziyara in his heart. If someone cannot go to the ziyara of an Imam, he can make ziyara from distance. In references of du'a and ziyara (such as Mafatih al-jinan ), there are special ziyara texts for making ziyara from distance. Benefits There are different types of Ziyara, each of which has unique benefits. For example, ziyara of Ka'ba has certain philosophy and certain manners of performance which are mentioned in the references of du'a and ziyara in detail. Ziyara of the faithful and their graves is a mutual relationship that has benefits and fruits both for the visitor and the visited. In addition to abundant rewards for visiting the faithful, it is mentioned in many hadiths that the one is buried in the grave senses the presence of his visitor and becomes happy with their presence. Other benefits for the ziyara of the graves of the faithful include being reminded about death, taking lessons, and being prepared for a correction. Merits of the ziyara of Infallible Imams (a) The Prophet (s) and Pure Imams (a) are perfect people and most beloved servants of God who are closest to God and at the peak of Taqwa (God-wariness) and God has kept them immaculate from any sins and errors. To love the Ahl al-Bayt (a) is God's order and showing enmity with them is actually showing enmity with God. Reaching high levels of closeness to God without loving the Ahl al-Bayt (a) and accepting their Wilaya is not possible. Accordingly, the merits of ziyara can be understood, since ziyara is among the best ways to connect to the infallible leaders which brings about great opportunities and spirituality. Also, respecting Imams (a) strengthens the spiritual connection between the visitor and Imam (a) and in fact makes their spiritual path continue. Forgiveness of the sins, benefitting from intercession of Imams (a) and fulfillment of requests are among other spiritual fruits, ziyara of Imams (a) bring about. To give examples, some hadiths about the merits of ziyara are mentioned below: Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"Anyone who visits the grave of Imam al-Husayn (a) for the sake of God, God will free him from the fire of the hell and keeps him safe on the Day of Judgment. He would not ask God any request whether about the world or the hereafter except he would be granted.\" [23] Imam al-Rida (a) said, \"The friend and followers of every Imam are bound to a covenant with him which would be fulfilled completely only when those Imams's (a) graves are visited. Thus, one who visits Imams (a) with all his love and admits to anything they desired, his Imams (a) will intercede for him on the Day of Judgment .\" [24] Imam al-Rida (a) said, \"Anyone who visits me in this lonely town ( Mashhad ), I will come to visit him in three places and will free him from fears: when his records of actions are submitted to him when he passes Sirat and when his actions are being measured.\" Educational Functions In addition to rewards mentioned for visitors of Imams (a) in hadiths, the culture of ziyara has several social and educational functions such as the benefits mentioned below: Increase of the visitor's knowledge and learning religious teachings through ziyara texts Learning about the positions of Imams (a) and strengthening Wilaya relationship between the visitors and the friends of God Providing a good model for the society Preparing religious environment of the shrines of Imams (a) and the graves for dissolving the sins and developing virtues Social and Political Functions Since the beginning of their history and in most ages, Shi'a has been a minority opposite to the government and hated by different political powers; therefore, political and social issues have been blended with the souls and beliefs of Shi'a. During the history of Shi'a, respected shrines of infallible Imams (a) have been centers for knowledge and preaching religion, origins of revolutions and uprisings, places to make covenants for revolutions and social movements, etc. Largest Shi'a seminaries have been developed in Najaf , Qom and Mashhad . According to political and social problems, some major roles can be mentioned for ziyara in brief: Keeping the collective spirit alive and strengthening Shi'a identity and also continuing the struggles of Imams (a) against oppressors Creating the feeling of hope in hardships and critical situations among Shi'a Keeping the spirit of heroism and bravery alive in people and spreading it in the society Preaching the spirit of seeking truth and justice and focusing on claiming people's rights and implementation of justice as the most important goal of Shi'a which can obviously be learned through the texts of Ziyara. Reviving the spirit of revenge from oppressors by mentioning instances of oppression brought upon Shi'a Imams (a) and their followers during history. Focusing on the society and ideal government which Imam al-Mahdi (a) will establish after his reappearance . Ziyara-texts Besides giving certain instructions for the ziyara, also some texts were taught in Shi'a tradition and hadiths to be recited during the ziyara of Imam's tombs. Ziyara-texts received from the Ahl al-Bayt (a) mostly have content-rich with authentic Islamic beliefs and teachings. Some of such ziyara-texts have found more importance and fame due to their special content or reference; such as Ziyara Ashura' , al-Jami'a al-Kabira , Ziyara Amin Allah , Ziyara Warith and Ziyara Al Yasin . The importance of ziyara and great range of its manners has made the discussion of ziyara-text as an important religious issue, to be the subject for many works. Ibn Qulawayh al-Qummi 's Kamil al-Ziyarat is among the most authentic such references. Other such works are al-Shaykh al-Mufid 's al-Mazar , al-Shaykh al-Tusi 's Misbah al-mutahajjid , Sayyid b. Tawus 's Muhaj al-da'awat , Ibn al-Mashhadi 's al-Mazar al-kabir , al-Allama al-Majlisi 's Tuhfat al-za'ir and Shaykh 'Abbas Qummi 's Mafatih al-jinan . Doubts Cast by Critics In contemporary time, Wahhabis have made literalistic interpretations of the verses of the Qur'an and have questioned ziyara of the graves. These questions have been answered in different books of Shi'a and Sunni scholars. See Also Haram (holy site) Ziyara of Imam al-Husayn (a) Notes References Books Rites Related"}
{"title": "Dajjal", "text": "Dajjāl (Arabic: دَجَّال ) is a person or being which in some narrations has been considered among the greatest enemies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It is mentioned in narrations that Dajjal appears at the time of hardship and famine. He will deceive and attract a group to himself, but finally will be destroyed by Imam (a). According to Shiite hadiths , Dajjal's riot is a sign of the Reappearance of the Twelfth Shiite Imam. Lexical Meaning \"Dajjal\" comes from the root form \"Dal Jim Lam\" (Arabic: دال جیم لام ) meaning \"very deceiving\". The word \"Dajjal\" in Hebrew teachings means \"enemy of God\" constituting from \"Dajj\" meaning \"enemy\" and \"al\" meaning \"God\". (In Hebrew, \"al\" and \"il\" mean God, e.g. Israel means friend of God, or as Jewish interpret triumphant with God, who prevails with God!). In Muslim Sources In Sunni Sources Most of the narrations regarding Dajjal have been narrated by Ahmad b. Hanbal in Musnad , al-Tirmidhi in his Jami' , Ibn Majah in his Sunan , Muslim in his Sahih , and by Ibn Athir in al-Nihaya from Abd Allah b. Umar and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Jabir b. Abd Allah al-Ansari . In Sunni hadiths, the riot of Dajjal is taken as a sign of the Day of Judgment . In Shia Sources In Shiite books of hadiths, there are only few hadiths to the effect that the riot of Dajjal is a sign of the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) along with the Heavenly Cry , the riot of Sufyani , and the riot of Yamani . These hadiths are not regarded as reliable . There are mentions that he will be killed by Imam (a) or in another narration by Jesus Christ (a) . In these narrations, there is no mention of the issues suggested in Sunni narrations such as Dajjal's mischiefs, his appearance, his followers, etc. According to a narration by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq from the Prophet (s) , mention of Dajjal has been in the past but his presence will be in future. According to hadiths, Dajjal appears at a time of hardship and starvation, deceives a group of people, and gathers them around himself. If we assume the story of Dajjal as true, undoubtedly many of the characteristics mentioned for him would seem legendary. Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi narrated a hadith from the Prophet (s) through Sunni sources saying, \"No prophet was ever assigned to mission unless he alarmed his people about the mischief of Dajjal.\" According to the lexical meaning of Dajjal, it seems that it would not refer to a certain person, but anyone having invalid claims trying to deceive people might be Dajjal. In this regard, existence of several Dajjals can be justified who may have emerged in different periods and have tried to make mischief and deceive people having weak faith . Existence of hadiths in which several Dajjals are mentioned supports this assumption including a hadith from the Prophet (s), \"Before coming of the Dajjal, more than seventy Dajjals will come.\" Therefore, the issue of Dajjal suggests that on the verge of the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , a deceiving person would do all he can to keep the culture and system of ignorance in order to make people doubtful about the truth and accomplishment of Imam's (a) uprising and his leadership. About Dajjal, many unfounded assumptions have been proposed, none of which have any clear and definite reference and they are only based on possibilities. In the New Testament In Hebrew and in Jewish doctrines, the word, \"Dajjal\", means the enemy of God, composed of the word, \"dajj\" (enemy) and \"al\" (God). In the New Testament , it only exists in the letters of John, the Apostle, and those who deny the Christ, the Father, or the Son are called Dajjal. In English translation of holy books of Christianity , \"Anti-Christ\" has been considered as the equivalent for it which is the Greek corresponding word; as we read in the first letter of John, \"Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.\" Also, in this chapter, verses 22 and 23 we read, \"Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist--denying the Father and the Son.\" . Time of Emergence According to some non-certain hadiths, Dajjal begins his riot in Isfahan or Khorasan . It is mentioned in a hadith that when the spoils of the war in Constantinople are being shared, the news of the emergence of Dajjal is given to Imam al-Mahdi (a) and his companions.\" On the verge of the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a), many signs appear one of which is the coming of Dajjal. Characteristics, Beliefs and Thoughts In hadiths (the origin for most of them are Sunni sources), it is mentioned that Dajjal claims to be God and by his existence, a great bloodshed and mischief happens in the world. It can be learned from the reports that his right eye is sealed and his left eye is in the middle of his forehead and illuminates and that there is a blood clot is in his eye. He is large, powerful, weird looking and very skillful in magic. There is a black mountain in front of him which seems to people that it is a mountain of bread and there is a white mountain behind him which seems to people as flowing pure water. He shouts, \"My servants! I am your great Lord.\" Dajjal passes everywhere but he does not go to Mecca , Medina , and Jerusalem al-Quds . Most of his followers are adulterine Jews and Bedouin Arabs who have crowns on their heads. It is mentioned in these reports that about Dajjal, the Prophet (s) said, \"Every believer who sees Dajjal, will spit on his face and recites the Sura al-Fatiha (Qur'an 1) to dispel that cursed one's magic.\" According to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , in a lengthy speech, Imam Ali (a) said, \"Imam al-Mahdi (a) will go from Mecca to Jerusalem al-Quds with his companions and there war happened between Imam (a) and Dajjal and his army; and Dajjal and his army will be defeated so that the first to the last of them will be killed and then the world will thrive.\" Eventually, According to hadiths, Dajjal will be hung and executed by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in Kufa or a place beside the gate of Lad near Jerusalem al-Quds. On another hadith, Dajjal will be killed in Syria .

{"title": "Hadith al-Wasiyya", "text": "Hadith al-Wasiyya Subject Twelve Mahdis Issued by Prophet Muhammad (s) Validity of the chain of transmission Weak Shi'a sources Kitab al-Ghayba (al-Tusi) Ḥadīth al-Waṣiyya (Arabic: حَدیث الوَصیَّت ) lit. Hadith of succession is a hadith about twelve Mahdis , who succeed Imam al-Mahdi (a) . The hadith is cited in the book al-Ghayba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi . Ahmad al-Hassan, the leader of Ansar al-Mahdi, calls himself a mediated child of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the first of the twelve succeeding Mahdis by an appeal to this hadith. Shiite scholars reject Ahmad al-Hassan’s interpretation of the hadith, maintaining that it is incompatible with the widely accepted and authentic Shiite hadiths. Some researchers have studied the chain of transmission and content of the hadith and found it flawed. For instance, the chain of its transmission is said to be weak. Moreover, it is in contradiction with many hadiths in which the Prophet’s successors are restricted to the Twelve Imams . Introduction and Content of the Hadith Hadith al-Wasiyya is a hadith cited by al-Shaykh al-Tusi in his book al-Ghayba as quoted from the Prophet (s) . In Hadith al-Wasiyya, the Prophet (s) tells Imam 'Ali (a) that there will be Twelve Imams after him and then lists the names of the Twelve Shiite Imams. After this, the Prophet (s) says twelve Mahdis will succeed the Twelfth Imam (a) after his demise. Here is the final part of the hadith: “After them [the Twelve Imams], there will be twelve Mahdis. When the Twelfth Imam passes away, he will be succeeded by his son, who is the first close person. He has three names: one is my name, the other is my father’s name; that is, 'Abd Allah and Ahmad, and his third name is Mahdi, and he is the first believer.” The hadith is the main evidence used by Ahmad al-Hassan, the leader of Ansar al-Mahdi, to prove the existence of twelve Mahdis after the twelve Imams. By making recourse to this hadith, he claims that he is the first Mahdi and Imam al-Mahdi’s son. Shiite scholars believe that the chain of transmission of this hadith is not reliable. Moreover, they reject Ahmad al-Hassan’s interpretation of the hadith. Ahmad al-Hassan’s Recourses to the Hadith By making an appeal to Hadith al-Wasiyya, Ahmad al-Hassan says that there will be twelve Mahdis after Imam al-Mahdi (a), claiming that he is the first of those Mahdis. In addition, he cites the term “his son” (ibnih) in the hadith to argue that he is a mediated son of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Accordingly, he claims that he will play a role before Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance , during his government, and afterwards. Views of Shiite Scholars Shiite scholars believe that Hadith al-Wasiyya is incompatible with well-known authentic hadiths. They include al-Tabrisi (a fifth/eleventh-century Quranic exegete), al-Irbili (a seventh/thirteenth-century scholar of hadith), al-'Allama al-Majlisi , and al-Hurr al-'Amili (an eleventh/seventeenth-century scholar of hadith). Moreover, al-Tabrisi and al-Irbili believe that this hadith is incompatible with authentic hadiths to the effect that there will be no other government after Imam al-Mahdi’s. Problems with Hadith al-Wasiyya Other objections have also been raised to any recourse to Hadith al-Wasiyya: This is khabar al-wahid (hadith transmitted by one person), which just yields probabilistic knowledge, and thus, it cannot be deployed to established beliefs. [12] According to this hadith, the Prophet’s successors will be 24, which is at odds with the well-established restriction of his successors to 12. [13] It contradicts the hadiths according to which Imam al-Mahdi (a) is the final successor (khatam al-awsiya'). Moreover, it is incompatible with several hadiths about raj'a (return). [14] The chain of transmission of this hadith is weak: its transmitters are unreliable or unknown. So, it cannot pose a challenge for authentic hadiths .

{"title": "Intizar al-Faraj", "text": "Intiẓār al-Faraj (Arabic: إنتظار الفَرَج ) or the Wait for the Relief is, in the Shiite terminology, the expectation for the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , which will occur miraculously and extraordinarily, as a result of which the world will be filled with justice . According to Shiite doctrines, the Wait for Relief requires spiritual and moral preparations. Terminology \"Faraj\" is an Arabic word meaning relief or release from griefs. In the phrase, \"Intizar al-Faraj\", it refers to the relief that people of the world will have after the Reappearance of the Twelfth Imam (a). The Virtue of the Wait and the Waiting Person in Hadiths Many virtues are mentioned in Shiite hadiths for the Wait and the person who waits (Muntazir). For example, the Wait for the Relief is said to be the best and the most lovely action and the first worship , and the Muntazir is said to be resurrected as a man of God , superior to others at all times, and among Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Imam al-Sadiq (a) says, \"Those who know the matter (i.e. the Imam of their time), they will wait for the Relief\". That is, if one knows the Imam of his time and knows what the Imam expects from his followers, he will then start an uprising against the unjust government, and the Relief (al-Faraj) is the day when the Imam's expectations are met. According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the Wait for Qa'im (a) is said to be a tenet of the religion along with testifying for the Oneness of God and the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Also, the Muntazir is said to be like someone who is in the camp together with al-Qa'im (a), waving his sword along with the Prophet (s), and is then martyred. Duties of the Waiting Person Given different views about the Islamic government in the period of Occlusion, there are different views about the obligations of a person who is waiting for the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). No Particular Duties Some people believe that the Occultaion of the Imam indicates that it is not possible to implement the Islamic rulings; otherwise, the Imam (a) himself would reappear. Thus, no attempt is needed. They believe that the Wait is tantamount to the surrender to the historical predetermination: we cannot help but live under injustice and corruptions until the Savior reappears. Such a Wait is at the service of unjust rulers to silence the people. According to another view about government in the period of Occultation , the Occultation leads to deprivation from all the blessings of the presence of the Imam (a), including an Islamic government. Some people have appealed to hadiths regarding taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) and applied them to the period of Occultation to show that dissimulation and silence towards unjust rulers are obligatory until the Uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Shiite Akhbaris who deny ijtihad reject any social roles for Shiite scholars, including the establishment of a government in the period of Occultation, because for them the views of a mujtahid are only probabilistic and thus unreliable. To the contrary, some scholars appeal to cases, such as a local government being assigned to Malik al-Ashtar or the issuance of fatwas being assigned to Aban b. Taghlib and Zakariyya b. Adam , to show that the views of a non-Infallible should be obeyed by others if that is grounded in his ijtihad. The Muntazir has Heavy Responsibilities However, many scholars believe that a Muntazir has heavy responsibilities. In his criticism of the above views, Imam Khomeini believes that taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) is restricted to ancillaries of the religion ; it is not allowed with regard to the tenets of Islam . He emphasizes that we could not avoid the implementation of Islamic rulings in the last 1200 years, since the Reappearance might not occur until thousands of years later, we cannot avoid this now. For it is not acceptable to shut down the rulings and the Islam. Imam Khomeini defines the Wait for the Relief as follows: \"if a person who waits for Faraj thinks that he should only pray without having any other obligations, then he is not a true Muntazir, even if he acts upon his own Shari'a obligations.\" Imam Khomeini believes that we should expedite the Reappearance by providing its grounds. True Muntazir Not everyone can claim that he is waiting for the Faraj of the Occulted Imam (a) , because people who are waiting for a reformer should themselves be reformed and righteous , and a person can reform himself only if he knows the Imam of his time; otherwise he will be like someone who lives in the Age of Jahiliyya and will die like people of Jahiliyya. The Wait According to the Sunnis The Wait for al-Mahdi is not restricted to the Shi'a . There are mutawatir hadiths about al-Mahdi in Sunni sources with reliable chains of transmitters. In Sunni collections of hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad (s) is quoted as prognosticating that a man from the Household and the progeny of lady Fatima (a) will come, who will fill the world with justice. Abd al-Rahman b. Khaldun, a scholar of the ninth/ fifteenth century —who wrote a well-known prolegomenon to the book, al-Ibar —says, \"Be aware that the majority of Muslims throughout the ages have believed that in the End Time a man from the Household will inevitably reappear, who will support the religion, reveal the justice, and will be followed by Muslims. He will dominate the Islamic territories, and his holy name is al-Mahdi. According to reliable sources of hadiths, decisive Signs of Reappearance are Dajjals riot and other events will take place. [For example,] Jesus (a) , peace be upon him, will follow him and will kill Dajjal, or will reappear together with him and help him in killing Dajjal and will follow al-Mahdi, peace be upon him, in his prayer\". Although Sunni Muslims believe in the Wait for the Reappearance of al-Mahdi (a), they believe that he is not born yet. The Imami Shi'a and some other Islamic and non-Islamic denominations also wait for a savior who is born and alive and oversees the actions, sayings, and troubles of people.

{"title": "Wilaya", "text": " Wilāya (Arabic: الولاية ) and its paronyms, literally meaning guardianship, are widely used in the Qur'an to mean administration and authority. Wilaya is sometimes an act by God , which is the same as monotheism and counts as a Divine Attribute . Such a wilaya, which is known as generative guardianship consisting in a causal relationship between the creator and creatures, is exclusively attributed to God. Wilaya is essential to God. Thus, wilaya of some prophets and Infallible Imams is a manifestation of God's wilaya. Sometimes wilaya is legislative (tashri'i) and conventional, that is, making the laws of the created world. This type of wilaya is also exclusive to God. Wilaya is sometimes a human action, in which case it is a legislative wilaya . This type of wilaya is discussed in jurisprudence , including wilaya (guardianship) over mahjur people (or wards) and wilaya on elites or wilaya al-faqih (guardianship of the jurist). Shiite theologians believe that not all prophets had wilaya. According to Qur'anic verses, only some prophets, such as the Prophet Muhammad (s) and Abraham (a) , had the position of wilaya. They also appeal to the principle of grace (Qa'ida al-Lutf) to show that God merely should introduce the \"wali\" (the person who has wilaya). The Principle implies that the wali be infallible and be introduced by another infallible person, such as a prophet. Although in mysticism , wilaya counts as an internal aspect of the religion and a hidden treasure, some people maintain that any wayfarer of the mystical path can reach the position of wilaya after traveling the stages of the spiritual journey. Wilaya is the position of proximity to God that, according to some other people, is exclusive to the Prophet (s) and Infallible Imams (a) . Wilaya as Guardianship The majority of philologists take \"wilaya\" to mean guardianship or friendship. According to some scholars, the contexts of some verses of the Qur'an give a reason to interpret \"wilaya\" as guardianship. Wilaya as guardianship and administration, which is significant in the Shiite thought, is of two kinds: Wilaya over objects, and wilaya over persons. An instance of the former is wilaya over the property or possessions of a deceased person, and instances of the latter include a wali's guardianship over all financial affairs of a child or a madman, or the wilaya of God and His messengers, such as some prophets and Infallible Imams (a) in mundane and afterlife affairs of believers . The Qur'an's Approach to \"Wilaya\" The term, \"wilaya\" and its paronyms are said to be among the most widely used words in the Qur'an. Although its paronyms, such as \"wali\" and \"mawla\", have been used in various meanings in the Qur'an 233 times (110 times in verb forms and 123 in noun forms), the word \"wilaya\" has occurred only two times in the Qur'an; once in Qur'an 8 :72 and once again in Qur'an 18 :44, in both of which it is written as \"walaya\". Some people hold that there is no difference between \"walaya\" ( وَلایة ) and \"wilaya\" ( وِلایة ); both meaning closeness and guardianship. However, there are people who maintain that \"walaya\" means Lordship, love, victory, friendship, and connection, whereas \"wilaya\" means guardianship and rule. Moreover, \"walaya\" is said to be exclusive to God, while \"wilaya\" applies to creatures. 'Allama Tabataba'i believes that \"wilaya\" in the Qur'an does not mean love; instead, it means administration and guardianship. One of the most important Qur'anic verses for the Shi'a is said to be the verse 55 of the Qur'an 5 , known as the al-Wilaya Verse . According to many Shiite scholars and some Sunni scholars, such as al-Zamakhshari , al-Tabari , al-Niyshaburi, and al-Fakhr al-Razi , the verse was revealed about Imam 'Ali (a) . Wilaya as a Social, Political, and Spiritual Principle It is reported that there are many hadiths in which wilaya is considered to be one of the most fundamental and important tenets of the religion, because it is concerned with the administration and rule of religious affairs, whether they are internal or external, bodily or spiritual, worldly or otherworldly, material or non-material, social or concerned with worship. All these issues are components of Islam over which the Prophet (s) had wilaya. Wilaya is believed to be very significant for the Shiite thought, because there are hadiths according to which wilaya is a condition for the validity of religious practices. Also, wilaya is believed to be a very important issue in the tradition of the Prophet (s), because he made recommendations about wilaya more than he did about anything else. There are a number of hadiths, such as Hadith al-'Ashira , Hadith of Anas , Hadith al-Ghadir , Hadith al-Manzila , Hadith al-Thaqalayn , Hadith al-Safina , etc. in which the Prophet (s) recommended about wilaya. Moreover, the Third Testimony in Shiism, that is bearing witness for the wilaya of Imam 'Ali (a) in adhan and iqama , after bearing witness for the unity of God and the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s), signifies the importance of wilaya in the Shiite thought. This has been regarded as heretical by Sunni scholars, although there is evidence that the Third Testimony was recited by people, such as Salman and Abu Dhar , during the life of the Prophet (s) as well. Imamate: Specific Wilaya \" Imamate \" is said to mean rule and government. In verses of the Qur'an and hadiths from the Infallibles (a) , the word means a leader and a spiritual role-model or a person whose sayings and actions are reliable, as well as a political leader, which is also referred to as \"wali al-amr\" (administrator of affairs). It is claimed that wilaya has not been discussed independently of the problem of imamate; wilaya or guardianship over all believers is said to have been discussed as a component of imamate. Some Shiite scholars do not distinguish wilaya from imamate. For example, in his book, Ayat-i wilayat dar Qur'an (Verses of wilaya in the Qur'an), Makarim Shirazi uses the words, \"wilaya\" and \"imamate\" interchangeably. Also, in his Payam-i Qur'an (the message of the Qur'an), he introduces general and specific wilaya as imamate and leadership. In his book, Wilayat-i faqih , Jawadi Amuli also uses the terms, \"imamate\" and \"wilaya,\" interchangeably. Moreover, in his Imamat wa rahbari (imamate and leadership), Morteza Motahhari takes imamate to mean wilaya. However, some contemporary scholars hold that it is a degradation of the position of imamate to reduce it to wilaya or administration of mundane affairs, since imamate is primarily concerned with religious, rather than mundane, affairs, just like prophethood . Not All Prophets Have Wilaya The position of prophethood is not equivalent to that of wilaya and administration. Thus, some scholars, such as al-Shaykh al-Tusi , maintain that prophets do not necessarily have wilaya and the right to administer people's affairs only by virtue of their prophethood. Only some prophets had wilaya over people. Wilaya in this sense is inseparable from imamate. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi's position was taken by al-Shaykh al-Mufid to be agreed upon by the majority of Shiite scholars. Contrary to other scholars, Muqaddas Ardabili does not differentiate between a prophet and an Imam , holding that the only difference between them is that a prophet receives revelations , while a wali or Imam does not. There is no Qur'anic verse in which prophets are introduced as guardians or walis over people, except a few of them who had a position higher than prophethood, such as the Prophet Muhammad (s) and Abraham (a) . The Qur'an 2 :247 states that there were only few prophets, such as David (a) , Solomon (a) and Muhammad (s) who were both prophets and rulers (or kings) at the same time. On the contrary, it is believed by some others that it is impossible for a prophet not to have wilaya, because it would lead to the possibility of sins by prophets. Mirjahani believes that according to the Shiite thought, a prophet should be infallible against sins, and whoever is infallible is ipso facto a wali. Thus, since prophets were infallible, they were walis as well. Thus, prophethood without wilaya is impossible. However, it is not the case that every infallible person is a prophet. Thus, wilaya without prophethood is possible. Wilaya as an Act of God There are a number of verses in the Qur'an, such as the Qur'an 2 :257, Qur'an 8 :7, Qur'an 3 :68, Qur'an 47 :11, Qur'an 8 :40, Qur'an 22 :22, Qur'an 66 :4, and Qur'an 13 :11, that refer to God's administration and guardianship (wilaya) of the world. An important theological problem is wilaya as an act of God. It was discussed by some theologians within the issues of imamate , and by others as an independent issue. Examples of independent theological issues regarding wilaya, which have been written throughout the Islamic intellectual history, include the work of people such as al-Tirmidhi, al-Tabari, al-Mawardi, and Ibn Qutayba. God's Wilaya as Identical with His Unity \"Wali\" is a Divine Attribute, which is essential to God, just like His Unity, because the world would not come to existence without wilaya, and even if it comes to existence, it would not persist without wilaya. Thus, true wilaya is that of God. There are a number of occasions, in which the attribute of wilaya has been imputed to God in the Qur'an . For example, Qur'an 42 :9 emphasizes that true wilaya exclusively belongs to God. This is endorsed by 'Allama Tabataba'i . He believes that the verse points to the exclusiveness of wilaya to God and the obligation of taking God as the wali. The Human Caliphate on the Earth is Authorized by God It is held by many Shiite scholars that the human caliphate (khilafa) or succession on the Earth amounts to the human being becoming an example of divine attributes , inheriting His exclusive wilaya. There are conditions to be met by a person to obtain this position. Since wilaya is exclusive to God, it is not possessed by anyone other than God except when it is authorized by God Himself. Thus, the human wilaya is horizontal, as pointed out in the Qur'an . The Qur'an has identified the obedience of prophets and Ulu l-Amr with the obedience of God, because their wilaya was authorized by God. Thus, since it is obligatory to obey God, it is also obligatory to obey those whose wilaya is authorized by God. An Infallible's Wilaya as Identical with God's Wilaya The wilaya of Infallibles (a) is believed by some Shi'as to be identical with God's wilaya. This is not to say that they have a wilaya independently of God; instead, their wilaya is a manifestation of God's wilaya. That is, the wilaya of the Infallibles (a) is identical with God's wilaya as manifested in them. Their wilaya is authorized by God. Thus, it is obligatory for everyone to obey them just as it is obligatory to obey God, as implied by Ulu l-Amr Verse and al-Wilaya Verse . Infallibility as a Necessary Condition for Wilaya Wilaya has been discussed by many Shiite theologians under the issues of imamate . They hold that the appointment of the Imam as the wali or guardian of believers is necessitated by the Principle of Grace (qa'idat al-lutf). The principle implies that God should do everything that is necessary to bring people closer to belief and obedience and prevent them from disbelief and sins. Thus, the existence of prophets is necessary, because without a prophet people would never be aware of divine commands and prohibitions. The principle also implies that Infallible Imams (a) should be introduced by God, because the presence of the Imam is necessary for the above purposes. Thus, according to the Divine Grace, the appointment of a religious and political leader in the Islamic community is necessary. Such a political and religious leader should be Infallible against sins and mistakes, because since people tend to trespass the rights of others, the political leader should be infallible in order to prevent people from corruptions and disobedience. Otherwise, the Principle of Grace would be violated. A specific condition for a wali is that he should be introduced by an Imam or a prophet , because a wali should be infallible, and a person's infallibility is only known by someone who has the knowledge of the hidden . Forms of Wilaya Generative Wilaya Generative Wilaya (wilaya takwini) is that wilaya which allows the wali or guardian to administer and plan the affairs of all things in any way that he pleases. It also means to possess the power and ability to affect ontological affairs and to have the ability to administer the natural order of the World and to disrupt its usual system. Wilaya in ontology (takwin) is specific to God and according to Tawhid Rabubi it is He alone, by means of His Wilaya, who has the power to control the world and thus manifests His guardianship and lordship in many different forms. Concerning the ontological wilaya of God, the Qur'an says that He is the guardian (wali) of the believers and it is He who takes them out of darkness and into light. God in the Holy Qur'an, on many occasions, proclaims that Wilaya is confined solely to Him and that looking towards others is no benefit and only brings about lose and disappointment. In a verse He says that the oppressors have no guardian or helper and has severely reprimanded those people who take others as their guardian and helper instead of Him; He then says that only God is the guardian of the servants and it is Him who will bring the dead back to life and has power over all things. Legislative Wilaya Legislative Wilaya (wilaya tashri'i) has both a general and a specific meaning. Its general meaning is any form of guardianship that does not necessitates the interference in the ontological affairs of the World. This definition of Wilaya comprises Wilaya Tafsiri, Wilaya Siyasi and the specific meaning of legislative wilaya; this wilaya is the opposite of Generative wilaya in that its acceptance is voluntary and has no enforcement at all. In this way the Qur'an explains that the acceptance of God 's religion and Wilaya is voluntary and that those who reject and do not accept His Wilaya are outside of it i.e. His guardianship and introduces Himself as the guardian of only those who believe. 'Allama Tabataba'i , in explaining this form of wilaya, says: legislative wilaya means to legislate and propagate, develop the Ummah and to rule and judge in their affairs and differences. It is this meaning that God calls His prophets the guardians of the believers. In its specific meaning, legislative wilaya means to establish and set the legislations and rules of religion. This form of wilaya has many different forms, of which some are specific to the Prophet (s) , whilst others are specific to religious leaders. According to narrations, this right has also been entrusted to the Imams (a) . In some narrations it states that the Prophet (s) on a few occasions, himself, established the religious ruling. For example, the third and fourth units of a four unit prayer where made compulsory by the Prophet (s). However, this form of legislative wilaya at times encompasses the setting of a ruling as a primary ruling and at other times is it a specific governmental instance or an external referent or the collaboration of an external referent with a ruling that needs to be established. An example of this was during a specific era during the Caliphate of Imam Ali (a) who, because of the requirements of the government at that time, levied zakat on horses, that who according to the primary ruling should not have paid zakat on them. This action of Imam Ali (a) was in the form of a governmental ruling and not primary ruling. There is however, a difference of opinion on how this wilaya is implemented. Some are of the opinion that this wilaya i.e. Legislative wilaya in establishing primary rulings is solely in the possession of God and no one else, not even the Prophet (s) has the ability to establish primary religious rulings. However, others are of the opinion that there are exceptions to the rule, and that the Prophet (s) and the Infallible Imams (a) are a part of this exception. Wilaya Ijtima'i Wilaya Ijtama'i means that a person has the right of guardianship and leadership over a society and its political structures. According to the verses of the Qur'an, it is only God who has the right to rule and it is He alone who possesses the station of guardianship and wilaya over His servants. This matter includes all the forms and types of wilaya and hence also political and societal wilaya. However, from the point of view that God cannot govern the material world directly, he has entrusted this wilaya to a few of His servants, Therefore, God has raised a few individuals to this position and based upon His directions and commands, they guide and lead the society towards perfection. This station was not confined to only a few prophets, even thou only a handful of them had the governance of the society at their disposal and were the leaders of the society. The Prophet (s) was the last prophet who, for the period of ten years while in Medina , was also able to possess the political leadership of the society. After him (s), and according to narrations, this station was given to the Imams (a) by the command of God. This command occurred at Ghadir Khum , when the Prophet (s) was ordered to inform the masses of the leadership and Imamate of Imam Ali (a) and take the oath of allegiance from them for him (a). This order held such importance, that in the continuation of the verse it was revealed to the Prophet (s) that if he did not perform this order, all his previous efforts would have been wasted and it would have been as if he never performed the message of God . It is upon this basis that the Shiite believe that after the Prophet (s), the position of societal leadership is entrusted to the Infallible Imams only and no one else has a right to claim such a position. Wilaya Tafsiri This form of wilaya is given to a special group of God's servants, who by means of 'Ilm Ladunni and God inspired knowledge , have the responsibility of explaining and clarifying the verses of the Revealed Books, removing any misconceptions about them and to guard and protect the religion of God from interpolation and alteration in its teachings and rulings. During their lifetimes, the Prophets of God, who were assigned to partake in propagation, had the responsibility of performing this task. This responsibility and duty was placed on the shoulders of the majority of prophets who were sent for the guidance of people. These individuals were occupied with explaining the Words of God and the laws of the previous prophets. This position, that is a due to them being the religious authority and which necessitates the decisive proof of their speech in explaining the Book of God and the propagation of His religion, after the Prophet (s) was compounded as one of the responsibilities and duties of the Twelve Imams (a) . Awliya (Guardians) God : Based upon religious edicts, it is God who is the essential and primary guardian, whose wilaya has not been taken from anyone or anything else. The Qur'an in many verses alludes to this matter as can be seen in Qur'an 2 :257. The Prophets (a) : Their wilaya is an extension of the wilaya of God and it is only by means of His permission that they are able to implement it over His creation. This wilaya includes all the forms of wilaya except legislative wilaya in its specific meaning concerning the setting of primary legislation. However, the Prophet (s) was the only prophet who, on certain occasions, was allowed to exercise this wilaya in setting primary legislation. Occasions such as the adding of the third and fourth rak'as of a four rak'a prayer, the third rak'a of the Maghrib prayer , the daily recommended prayers and the recommendation of fasting for three days in every month. The Infallible Imams (a) : Their wilaya is an extension of the Prophet's (s) wilaya and they have the authority to implement it. Their wilaya includes Generative Wilaya, Wilaya Tafsiri, Wilaya Siyasi and the leadership of the Ummah. A Qualified Jurist: According to narrations, some jurists , who possess the relevant characteristics, have the permission to implement wilaya. This type of wilaya is known as Wilaya al-Faqih or the Guardianship of the Jurist. In jurisprudential sources, a limit type of wilaya has been ordained for a special group of people, for example the wilaya that a father or paternal grandfather have over their child or grandchild or the wilaya of a believer over a mentally challenged or foolish person. The difference between this wilaya and the previous ones is in its confinement to specific instances. Mystical Journey without Wilaya is Pointless Wilaya is considered as a main element of Islamic mysticism . Spiritual journey is said to make no sense without wilaya. It is widely held that the mystical notion of wilaya is rooted in the teachings of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) . An investigation of Sufi sources shows that \"wilaya\" has been interpreted differently in different branches of Sufism in accordance with their principles. Wilaya is believed by many Sufis to be the internal aspect of the religion and the reality of servanthood for God. On the one hand, it implies the servants' proximity to, and friendship with, God, and on the other hand, God's proximity to His servants and all entities in the world. The interior of wilaya is said by mystics to be a hidden treasure (kanz khafi) with different degrees and an unknown nature, because it is incomprehensible and indefinable. The highest degree of wilaya is the position of proximity to, or \"sustaining togetherness\" (al-ma'iyya al-qayyumiyya) with, God. The position is obtained when a person overcomes his or her self in order to meet God, annihilating his or her self on the path of God. The position is believed by some people to be exclusive to the Prophet (s) and Infallible Imams (a) , but it was denied by those who consider it to be achievable by every traveler of the spiritual path. According to al-Jami , there are two types of wilaya: general and specific. The former is common to all believers, and the latter is exclusive to those who have traveled the stages of the spiritual journey and arrived at its final stages, that is, the annihilation in God. Sufi sources imply that wilaya is an acquired position, which can be obtained by traveling the stages of the spiritual journey and arriving at the stage of annihilation in God. However, the Shi'as believe that \"wali\" should be appointed by God. Thus, it is not an acquired position. Wilaya as a Religious and Mundane Position according to Sunnis Al-Himadi maintains that the majority of Sunni jurists have used \"wilaya\" to mean rule and kingdom in such a way that includes imamate and all jurisprudential ancillaries regarding wilaya. Moreover, he claims that the word has also been used in other meanings, such as deputyship. However, the majority of Sunni exegetes of the Qur'an and theologians have attempted to interpret \"wilaya\" in Qur'anic verses and hadiths, and in particular in Qur'an 5:55 ( al-Wilaya Verse ), as victory and love. \"Wilaya\" in the latter verse has been interpreted in Tafsir al-Tabari , Tafisir al-minar , and Tafsir al-Maraghi as victory. However, al-Fakhr al-Razi has interpreted it as love. Thus, contrary to the Shi'a, they believe that the main origin of the issue of imamate is jurisprudence , which is concerned with actions of the accountable person (mukallaf), and it has no place in theology . Thus, discussions of imamate in some Sunni theological books are taken to be mere responses to rival views in this regard. Some Sunni scholars allegedly hold that people bring wilaya to whomever they elect as a leader or imam, and since that person is elected by people, it is endorsed by the Islamic shari'a as well. Thus, imamate or wilaya consists, in fact, in a contract between the Umma (Islamic nation) and the Imam. The ruling of the shari'a is the endorsement of the elected person, rather than appointing an imam. A Contemporary Discussion Recently a discussion has been proposed in discussing the wilaya of the Imams (a) and its relationship to the finality of the Prophet (s) . Some are of the opinion that belief in the wilaya of the Imams (a), be it Generative Wilaya, legislative or even Tafsiri, is in contradiction to the finality of the Prophet (s). In response, answers have been given by the theologians in opposition to this opinion. Based on those answers, wilaya does not contradict finality in any way but is also the most important characteristic of the Infallible Imams (a) . Therefore, by means of the continuation of Islam and its perfection and completion, and by taking into consideration the small amount of time the Prophet (s) had to propagate the roots and branches of Islam, it is in need of an Imam whose speech and words will be a decisive proof for people to hold onto. So this Imam must possess wilaya in both explaining and interpreting the religion and its laws.

{"title": "Letters of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Letters of Imam al-Mahdī (a) or Tawqīʿāt al-Imām al-Mahdī (a) are letters and correspondences of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It sometimes refers to his non-written words as well. There are eighty \"tawqi'at\" (letters) by Imam al-Mahdi (a). They are mostly issued during the Minor Occultation and are about different issues such as the principles of Shiite beliefs , Islamic jurisprudence , financial matters, and the like. The notion of tawqi' Tawqi'at (plural of Tawqi'; meaning: letters) of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is a Shiite term referring to Imam al-Mahdi's (a) written words. It has also been used to refer to his non-written hadiths ; for example, al-Shaykh al-Saduq cited some of his hadiths in the section of tawqi'at. Moreover, some remarks by Imam al-Mahdi's (a) Four Deputies , such as information about the future and religious matters, are also considered as tawqi'at. The latter use is based on Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti 's remark that in matters religious he never speaks out of his own thoughts; rather he cites what he heard from the origin (that is, Imam al-Mahdi (a)). Number of tawqi'at Imam al-Mahdi's (a) tawqi'at are cited in the books, Kamal al-din by al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Ghiba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi. In the former, forty nine tawqi'at and a supplication are cited, some of which are short and some are long. The latter contains forty three tawq'iat and hadiths, considering some of these as Imam al-Mahdi's (a) miracles . Some of them are cited along with a description of their occasions, and some are manuscripts of the Imam (a) himself issued as public statements, including the principles of Shiism . Of these forty three tawqi's, twelve are cited from al-Shaykh al-Saduq and some of them can be found in Kamal al-din as well. Thus by omitting repeated tawqi's, the two books contain eighty tawqi's. Handwritings of tawqi'at In many hadiths, it is made explicit that correspondences by Imams (a) were in their own handwriting. Particularly, it is sometimes emphasized about Imam al-Mahdi's (a) tawqi'at that his own stamp was in the letters, and he sometimes made it explicit at the bottom of the letters that they were written by his own hands. How were the letters received and delivered? During the Minor Occultation , the main people who received Imam al-Mahdi's (a) letters and delivered letters of the Shiites to him were the special deputies of the Imam (a) . In some cases, however, letters or requests were delivered to Imam al-Mahdi (a) by some servants or visitors who went to Imam's (a) house. For example, Muhammad b. Yusuf al-Shashi sent a letter to the Imam (a) by a woman who visited Imam's (a) house, and received Imam's (a) reply from her. Sometimes the letters (tawqi'at) were public, and so they were duplicated by different people. The letters of the Imam (a) were sent by special messengers. Due to security issues, the identity of these messengers remained unknown, and they were mentioned as \"a woman\", \"a boy\", \"a black boy\", \"a messenger from Husayn b. Ruh\", and the like. The date of issuance Most of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) letters were issued during the Minor Occultation ( 260 /874 - 329 /941) as answers to questions delivered to Shiites by the Four Deputies . During the Major Occultation, only two letters have been addressed to al-Shaykh al-Mufid late in his life, but there are reservations about the attribution of these letters to Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Topics of tawqi'at On disputes over Imam Hasan al-'Askari's successor When God took him ( Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) ) to Himself, you thought God has vitiated His religion by cutting the medium (the Imam) between Him and the people. But this never happened and will never happen until the Dooms Day when God reveals His will. The previous Imam (a) passed away while he was happy and compliant with the practice of his ancestors. His will and knowledge and successor are among us, and no one will dispute us about his place with us. ( al-Shaykh al-Tusi , al-Ghayba , p. 286). Islamic Doctrines Some letters sent by Imam al-Mahdi (a) were answers to questions regarding Islamic doctrines, such as divine attributes , prophethood , and imamate . In an answer to questions about imamate, Imam al-Mahdi (a) emphasized that the Earth will never be without a hujja (Imam), and this divine tradition will last until the Dooms Day . He said that each Imam has the obligation to introduce the next Imam, and that Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) introduced him as his successor. He defended the institution of imamate in general and his own imamate against people like Ja'far al-Kadhdhab . He also asked Shiites not to predict a date for his reappearance, or search for his place. And he appointed trusted deputies for himself. Jurisprudential rules A vast and considerable part of the tawqi'at are answers to questions regarding the jurisprudential rulings, such as questions regarding cleanliness (tahara), prayer , fasting , hajj , testimony , judgeship, Endowment (waqf), transactions, khums , sadaqa (alms), marriage , intoxicants , visiting the shrines of Shiite Imams (a) , and the like. Financial matters: Some letters are concerned with money and property that Shiites sent to the Imam (a) as khums or other Islamic financial obligations by his deputies or agents. For example, Muhammad b. Shadhan b. Nu'aym al-Nisaburi says: \"I had 500 dirhams minus 20 dirhams. I wanted it to reach 500. So I added 20 dirhams from my own money to it, and I gave it to Asadi, but I did not mention the money that I had added to it. In his reply to me, Imam al-Mahdi (a) wrote, 'I have received 500 dirhams, 20 of which was from your own money'\". Imam al-Mahdi's last letter to the Fourth Deputy You will pass away within six days. So prepare yourself and do not leave your position (deputy of the Imam) to anyone else, since the second Occultation has started and I will not reappear except by God's permission. The reappearance will occur after a very long time when people's hearts become inexorable and the Earth is rife with cruelty and brutality. Soon some of my, Shiites will claim they have met me. Be aware that anyone who claims to meet me before the rise of Sufyani and the Heavenly Cry is a liar. ( al-Shaykh al-Saduq , Kamal al-din , vol. 2, p. 516) Denying pretenders: Because of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) secret life, some people pretended that they had relations with him in order to achieve their own interests. In letters to his Four Deputies —especially Husayn b. Ruh —, Imam al-Mahdi (a) denied and condemned such pretenders and liars. For example, al-Shaykh al-Tusi wrote about Abu Muhammad Hasan al-Shari'i , who was the first person who claimed to be a medium between the Imam (a) and people, that he was a companion of Imam al-Hadi (a) and Imam Hasan al-'Askari (a) , but he lied about the Imams (a), and Imam al-Mahdi (a) wrote a letter, cursing and condemning him. Karamat (supernatural wonders) and praying: Letters also contain things that might count as Imam al-Mahdi's (a) divine powers and karamat (theurgies), such as his praying for Shiites, informing them of other people's unknown financial rights and other secrets. Evaluation of tawqi'at The letters with jurisprudential contents have been appealed to by early jurists , but recently they have been more appealed to by scholars. Most of them are considered to be reliable by jurists, but some of them are not taken to be reliable. What is more, a correspondence is, for some scholars of jurisprudence , not as reliable as oral words heard by narrators of hadiths . Moreover, only the letters sent by Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Minor Occultation by his Four Deputies are reliable, and the ones allegedly issued after that are not reliable. Here is a couple of letters attributed to Imam al-Mahdi (a) after the Minor Occultation: The letters allegedly sent by Imam al-Mahdi (a) to al-Shaykh al-Mufid . The letters are said to be sent to al-Shaykh al-Mufid by a trusted person, who remained anonymous. There is serious doubt about the attribution of these letters to Imam al-Mahdi (a). [16] Some contemporary writers have considered a message sent by Shaykh Muhammad Kufi Shushtari to Sayyid Abu l-Hasan al-Isfahani to be a tawqi'. Sources of tawqi' The most important source for Imam al-Mahdi's (a) tawqi'at are Kamal al-din by al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Ghayba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi . There is a chapter in these books devoted to the tawqi'at. Other chapters also contain some tawqi'at. al-Kulayni , who lived during the Minor Occultation in the main centers of hadith ( Qom , Rey and Baghdad ), cited some tawqi'at in the first volume of his al-Kafi . Later these letters were cited and elaborately reported in some collections of hadiths, such as al-Ihtijaj , Ma'adin al-hikma , Bihar al-anwar and contemporary books regarding Imam al-Mahdi (a) and his correspondences (such as the seventh volume of 'Ali Ahmadi Miyanaji 's Makatib al-A'imma ).

{"title": "Mahdi", "text": "Mahdī (Arabic: مَهدی ) means the one who is guided by God . In Islamic hadiths , \"Mahdi\" is a title of the Islamic savior , and according to Shiite beliefs, this is the title of the Twelfth Imam (a) who is going to fill the earth with justice. Since the Prophet (s) prognosticated the emergence of a savior called \"Mahdi\" from his own household, since few days after the demise of the Prophet (s) until now, Muslims are waiting for the emergence of Mahdi (a) . Some Islamic sects such as Zaydiyya and Banu 'Abbas gave the title, “Mahdi,” to leaders of their uprisings against established governments and promised to enforce justice and remove injustices, whereby they managed to attract masses of people, who believed in the promised Mahdi (a) , to themselves and thus they established their own governments. On some accounts, in the early Islamic period, the title, \"Mahdi,\" was used for prominent figures as a sign of honor and respect. Some scholars contend that the first person who used \"Mahdi\" in its doctrinal use as a savior was Abu Ishaq Ka'b b. Mata b. Haysu' al-Himyari (d. 34/654-5). Literal Meaning In Arabic, \"Mahdi\" is an object adjective, meaning the one who is guided by God. The word comes from the root, “h-d-y,” which means guidance from grace and benevolence. Guidance here seems to be contrasted to misguidance, implying spiritual guidance. The word, “Mahdi,” does not appear in the Qur'an , although other cognates of the word do appear therein, including two verses in which the subject adjective of the root, “h-d-y,” which means the one who guides appear. Terminology In Islamic hadiths, when unqualified, “Mahdi” means the promised savior from the household of the Prophet (s) , who will fill the world with justice when it was filled with injustice. According to Shiite doctrines, he is the Twelfth Imam who is occulted at present. In Imami Shiite hadiths, Mahdi is referred to with other titles as well, such as \" Qa'im Al Muhammad \". Sunnis often use “Mahdi” in its plural form to describe the four caliphs immediately after the Prophet—those they call \" Rashidun Caliphs \"—as “al-Khulafa' al-Rashidun al-Mahdiyyun” (the guided Rashidun Caliphs). History In hadiths transmitted by both Shi'as and Sunnis, the Prophet (s) promises that a man from his family named “Mahdi” will appear, stating that he will fill the earth with justice, as it was filled with injustice. Thus, since the days after the demise of the Prophet (s), Muslims were waiting for the emergence of Mahdi (a) . In the early Islamic period, the title of Mahdi was given to prominent figures as a sign of honor and respect. Hassan b. Thabit (d. 54/673-4) wrote an ode for the Prophet (s) in which he used the title for the Prophet (s) as well: Alas, al-Mahdi [the Prophet] is now buried O the best person who has inhabited the earth, do not go away! Moreover, Sulayman b. Surad referred to Imam al-Husayn (a) after his martyrdom as Mahdi the son of Mahdi. Rajkowski claims that the first person who made a religious doctrinal use of “Mahdi” as a savior was Abu Ishaq Ka'b b. Mata b. Haysu' al-Himyari (d. 34/654-5). The Title, Mahdi, in Kaysanites Karbiyya , a branch of Kaysanites , believed after the death of Muhammad b. Hanafiyya that he was still alive and that he was the expected Mahdi. Some authors of religions and sects hold that Muhammad b. Hanafiyya was the first person in Islamic history who was given the title of Mahdi. In Titles of Abbasid Caliphs Official titles, especially early after the Abbasid movement—that is, the period of the first five Abbasid caliphs—had a Mahdawi nature. Abbasids used these titles for certain goals and purposes, because these titles expressed people's emotions, particularly those of poor and impoverished people who always hoped for better days to come. Mahdi or the expected savior meant the end of injustice, cruelty and a harbinger of a golden age and the age of justice and well-being. Such an attempt was made by Abbasid Caliphs to attracted masses who believed in Mahdi to the new government. This helped the victory of their movement to a large extent, and then it established the tenets of the new government. The ruling caliphs constantly transmitted the hopes of masses to their crown princes and the next caliph. The task was done with the choice of a new title in order to display him as savior. When the Abbasid government was solidified and established, it was no long necessary to deploy the tactic of using such titles. Thus, less emphasis was put upon them, and Abbasids forgot their old revolutionary slogans, and adopted more moderate ones which would guarantee the permanence and establishment of their government. This might be a reason why their followers—especially the fanatics among them—were disappointed and then led riots against the Abbasid government. Others tried to find a new non-Abbasid savior to fulfill their wishes, although others complied with the government and began serving in in the variety of their institutes. Common titles in the first Abbasid period (particularly, those of Abbasid caliphs) can be divided as follows: Public official titles, such as Amir al-Mu'minin, Khalifat Allah, and Malik; Private official titles, such as al-Imam, al-Qa'im, al-Murtada, al-Mansur, al-Mahdi, al-Rashid, al-Mu'tasim billah, and so on; Personal titles, such as “Dawaniqi” which was the title of al-Mansur, [13] al-Natiq bi-l-Haqq which was Ibn al-Hadi’s title. [14] His father wanted him to be his crown prince, instead of Harun. In Titles of Zaydi Imams Throughout the history, the title, Mahdi, was used for some Zaydi Imams such as al-Nafs al-Zakiyya , Yahya b. 'Umar, Sahib al-Fakhkh , Yahya b. al-Husayn , and so on. Some scholars of Islamic sects claim that branches of Zaydiyya consider every imam who calls people to himself and qualifies for imamate as an Imam and Mahdi. On this view, “Mahdi” is not limited a particular person.

{"title": "Major Occultation", "text": "The Major Occultation (Arabic: الغَيبَة الکُبرى ) is a term for the period of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) hidden life after the Minor Occultation . This period started from 329 /941 and continues until today. In this period, Shi'as are not in direct contact with the Imam (a). Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a) The disappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , the last and twelfth Shi'a Imam , is called the occultation of Imam Mahdi (a). According to Shi'a teachings, Imam al-Mahdi (a) has had two occultations: The Minor Occultation , which lasted sixty nine lunar years , and the Major Occultation, which continues to the present day. During the Minor Occultation, Imam al-Mahdi (a) communicated with the Shi'a through the four deputies , but during the Major Occultation this communication does not exits and the Shi'a must refer to the scholars for their religious needs. The Beginning of the Major Occultation From the beginning of his imamate in 260 /874, Imam al-Mahdi (a) limited his contacts with the Shi'a to the relations through his specific deputies , the last of whom was 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri who passed away in Sha'ban 15 , 329 / May 15 , 941 . He received the following letter from the Imam (a), one week before his death: \"O 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri! May God reward your brothers for [being patient about] your loss, because you will pass away after six days. So prepare yourself, and do not designate anyone as your successor after your death, because the absolute occultation has occurred. There will be no appearance until God gives permission, and that will be after a long time when the hearts are hardened and the world is filled with injustice. Some of my followers will claim to have seen me, but know that whoever claims to have seen me before the uprising of the al-Sufyani and the heavenly cry he is indeed a liar and a slanderer.\" In this way, after the demise of al-Samuri, contacts with the Imam (a) through specific deputies ended and a new phase of occultation started, which was called the Major Occultation in later sources. Most Shi'a sources mention 329/941 as the year in which the fourth deputy passed away, but al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Fadl b. al-Hasan al-Tabrisi have recorded the year 328 /940. The Role of the Imam in the Period of the Major Occultation According to Shi'i beliefs, although Imam Mahdi (a) is in occultation, the world is receiving the blessings of his existence. The world needs the Imam (a) as the Proof of God for the continuation of its being. The Imam (a) not only has legislative wilaya but also generative wilaya over the world. As 'Allama Tabataba'i explains, the Imam's tasks are not limited to interpreting Islamic teachings and instructing people, but more importantly include his spiritual guardianship (wilaya), that is, leading the people and their deeds towards God , for which task physical presence or absence is irrelevant. Meeting with the Imam During Major Occultation Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of the Major Occultation has been a challenging issue for Shi'a scholars. Some scholars, such as Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Nu'mani , al-Shaykh al-Mufid , Fayd Kashani and Kashif al-Ghita' believe that it is impossible to meet the Imam (a) during the Major Occultation. The most important evidence in this regard is the last letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to his Fourth Deputy according to which whoever claims to have met the Imam (a) is called a liar. Yet the interpretation of this letter has been a matter of discussion among the Shi'a , and there have been different viewpoints among them as to the possibility of meeting the Imam (a) during this occultation. Some people believe that this letter is restricted to those who claim that they met the Imam (a) along with being his deputy or representative. Therefore, a group of scholars such as al-Sharif al-Murtada , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , Muhammad b. 'Ali al-Karajuki and Mirza Husayn Nuri have considered meeting Imam al-Mahdi (a) to be possible during Major Occultation. Many Shiite scholars have also talked about their meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. Those Who Have Allegedly Met the Imam In different Shi'i sources, several stories have been recorded regarding the people who have been able to meet the Imam (a) in the period of the Major Occultation. Some of the most well-known stories include the stories of the meeting of al-'Allama al-Hilli , Bahr al-'Ulum , Isma'il Hirqali, Haj 'Ali al-Baghdadi , and 'Ali b. Ibrahim b. Mahziyar . These stories are narrated in Bihar al-anwar and Mafatih al-jinan and works like al-Najm al-thaqib . General Deputyship During Major Occultation After the demise of the fourth specific deputy in 329/941, Imam al-Mahdi (a) did not appoint any other specific deputies. In this way, all direct contacts between the Imam (a) and the people were cut. According to hadiths related to the occultation--including the one in which the Imam (a) refers people to religious scholars with regard to worldly and religious matters--religious scholars and jurists are generally introduced as the deputies of the Imam (a) in this period.

{"title": "Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Meeting with Imām al-Mahdī (a) in the period of the Major Occultation has been a challenging issue for the Shi'as . Many Shiite scholars have talked about their meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. However, some other scholars, such as al-Nu'mani , believe that it is impossible to meet the Imam (a) during the Occultation. The most important evidence in this regard is the last tawqi' by Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to his fourth deputy according to which whoever claims to have met the Imam (a) is called a liar. Some people believe that this is restricted to those who claim that they met the Imam (a) along with being his deputy or representative. Some hadiths have recommended supplications and practices for meeting Imam al-Mahdi (a), and there are hadiths according to which it is possible for special followers of the Imam (a) to have contact with, and meet, him. Some scholars, such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Shaykh al-Tusi have devoted particular chapters of their books to stories of people who have met the Imam (a) and have explicitly confirmed the possibility of meeting him. People who are said to have met Imam al-Mahdi (a) include: Mirza Muhammad Husayn Na'ini , Sayyid b. Tawus , Ibrahim al-Kaf'ami , Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi , Abu l-Hasan Sha'rani , al-Shaykh al-Hurr al-'Amili , al-Muqaddas al-Ardabili , Mirza Muhammad Astarabadi , al-Shahid al-Thani , al-Sayyid Bahr al-'Ulum , al-Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri , and al-Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari . The Meaning of Meeting During the Major Occultation, it is possible for some people to see Imam al-Mahdi (a) without knowing him. It is also possible to see him in one's dreams. There is an agreement among the scholars that these two types of meeting are possible. What has always been subject to disagreements is meeting with the Imam (a) during the Major Occultation while recognizing him as Imam al-Mahdi (a) either during or after the meeting. There is a disagreement about the possibility of such a meeting among Shiite scholars. There are also discussions about having contacts with the Imam (a) through revelations and spiritual journeys and their reliability for religious beliefs or jurisprudential rulings. Before the Major Occultation There is an agreement among scholars about the possibility, and even occurrence, of meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) before the Major Occultation, both during the Minor Occultation and before it. In Shiite books of history and hadith , such as al-Kafi , al-Irshad , I'lam al-wara , Kamal al-din , al-Ghayba by al-Shaykh al-Tusi , and al-Ghayba by al-Nu'mani , some people who managed to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a) before the Minor Occultation and their stories are mentioned. They include Hakima bt. Imam al-Jawad (a) , the paternal aunt of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) who witnessed the birth of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Other people have also been mentioned as those who met Imam al-Mahdi (a) before the Minor Occultation, such as Ahmad b. Ishaq b. Sa'd al-Ash'ari , Sa'd b. 'Abd Allah al-Ash'ari al-Qummi , Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Faris al-Nishaburi , and Ahmad b. Hilal . It is reported in Shiite sources that during the sixty nine years of the Minor Occultation, several people other than the Four Deputies met Imam al-Mahdi (a), including Ibrahim b. Idris , 'Ali b. Ibrahim b. Mahziyar , Ahmad b. Ishaq al-Ash'ari al-Qummi , Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Musa al-Kazim (a) , Muhammad b. Ja'far al-Himyari , and some other figures from Qom . During the Major Occultation There are two views about meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation . Some people believe that it is possible and has occurred as well. The view was first propounded by al-Sayyid al-Murtada and then became popular among recent scholars. It was also propounded by al-Muhaddith al-Nuri , al-Karajuki , and al-Shaykh al-Tusi . According to al-Sayyid al-Murtada, it is possible for divine saints to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a). It seems that initially it was only the possibility of such a meeting which was at issue, but since the time of Sayyid b. Tawus (d. 664/1266) when the stories of such meetings were reported, its occurrence became certain, although some of the stories go back to earlier times. For example, the first story is that of Ibn Qulawayh (d. 368/978-9) in 339 /950-1. In some hadiths, supplications and practices are mentioned for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a). Many scholars wrote works in this regard and there are many accounts of people who claim to have met with Imam al-Mahdi (a). However, some other Shiite scholars maintain that it is not possible for the Shi'as to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. One of the most significant arguments for this view is the last letter of Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to the Fourth Deputy in which he referred to people who claim to meet him as liars. Thus, according to the Imam's (a) command, any claim to meet him should be rejected. Arguments of Proponents 1) Rational possibility: one argument by proponents of the possibility of meeting is that Imam al-Mahdi (a) has a human body just like other Imams (a) and none of the earlier Imams or Imam al-Mahdi (a) or the Four Deputies ever claimed that Imam al-Mahdi's (a) nature changed or that he went up to the sky. This is evidenced by the hadiths in which Imam al-Mahdi (a) is assimilated to Prophet Nuh (a) and Yusuf (a) , rather than Jesus (a) . Therefore, there is no rational reason to take meeting with the Imam (a) to be impossible. Moreover, none of the great and well-known Shiite scholars and authors, such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq , al-Shaykh al-Mufid , and al-Shaykh al-Tusi , believed that it is impossible to meet with the Imam (a). Some of them have even devoted chapters of their books to stories of people who met with the Imam (a) or at least the possibility of such meetings. Moreover, it is very unlikely for several people to claim something impossible at different times without facing serious, public denials. 2) Transmitted supplications and dhikrs for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a): another argument by proponents of the possibility of such a meeting is that there are many hadiths in which supplications and practices are cited for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a). The fact that such hadiths recommend people to recite such supplications and dhikrs shows that it is possible to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a). 3) Hadiths: proponents of the possibility of meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) also believe that there are at least two reliable and acceptable hadiths which imply this possibility: Ishaq b. 'Ammar quotes Imam al-Sadiq (a) as saying: \" Qa'im (that is, Imam al-Mahdi) has two occultations: a short one, and a long one. During the first occultation, nobody knows his place except certain Shi'as, and during the second occultation, nobody knows his place except his special mawali (servants)\". According to another hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a): \"the owner of this affair (uprising) has two occultations: one of them will be long … nobody, neither friends, nor enemies, knows about his place, except a servant who takes care of his tasks\". However, some people have objected to the chain of the transmission of these two hadiths as well as their implications. 4) Accounts of meeting by prominent Shiite figures: there are many reports in different books according to which many people, from distinguished scholars to ordinary people, have met with Imam al-Mahdi (a), and some of them even succeeded to talk to him. The reports are so frequent that they can be said to be mutawatir . This tawatur has been endorsed by Shiite scholars, such as al-Shaykh al-Hurr al-'Amili , Sayyid 'Abd Allah al-Shubbar , and Lutf Allah Safi Gulpayigani . Moreover, some of these reporters are very reliable, great, and well-known scholars. 5) Letters of al-Shaykh al-Mufid: three letters allegedly addressed by Imam al-Mahdi (a) to al-Shaykh al-Mufid might imply that he had relationships with Imam al-Mahdi (a). The letters are cited in Abu Mansur al-Tabrisi 's al-Ihtijaj . Supplications and Dhikrs for Meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) Some supplications, Istighathas (beseeching for help), and Visitation Supplications are transmitted for meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) , such as the Supplication of Nudba , Ziyara Al Yasin , and al-'Ahd Supplication . Moreover, some supplications have been transmitted with regard to practices and supplications specific to the meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a): 1. In his Makarim al-akhlaq , al-Hasan b. al-Fadl al-Tabrisi writes: \"it is transmitted that if one continuously recites the following supplication after every obligatory prayer , his life will be so long that it would be boring for him and he would finally meet with Sahib al-Amr (that is, Imam al-Mahdi). Here is the supplication: \"O God! Send your peace to Muhammad and the family of Muhammad! O God! Truly your truthful, accredited messenger, your peace be upon him and his family, said that you said: ‘I never doubted anything I do as I doubted the reception of the soul of My faithful servant who dislikes death and I dislike to bother him.' O God! So send your peace to Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten the faraj , victory, and comfort of Your saints and do not bother me and such and such a person (here you can mention anyone you want).\" 2. Another long supplication is also transmitted from Imam al-Sadiq (a) . He said if one recites the supplication after every obligatory prayer, he will meet Imam al-Mahdi (a) while awake or in his dreams. Written Work about the Meeting There are some independent works about the meeting or meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a). Some of these works were written shortly after the Minor Occultation . Moreover, some books or articles are written specifically with regard to meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a).

{"title": "Qiyamat Sughra", "text": "Al-Qiyamah al-Ṣughra (the Lesser Resurrection) (Arabic: القیامة الصغری ) refers to the period between death and al-Qiyamah al-Kubra (the greater Resurrection). Referring to this hadith of the Prophet (s) saying, \"When a person dies, his resurrection will begin\" , some scholars of theology believe that every person has two resurrections: A lesser resurrection and a greater resurrection . The lesser resurrection of a person begins with his death and continues until the greater resurrection. Some theological books use the expression \"al-Qiayamah al-Sughra\" to refer to Barzakh . According to verses of the noble Qur'an , the time of the greater resurrection is unknown and only God knows about it. Fayd Kashani said that as soon as all humans die, the lesser resurrection will end and the greater resurrection will begin; but, the time when all people would die is known only by God. According to hadiths, the lesser resurrection is peculiar to humans, while in the greater resurrection, all beings will be present. In some hadiths and Shi'a books, Raj'a is referred to as the lesser resurrection. In the terminology of Islamic mysticism , the volitional death is referred to as the lesser resurrection.

{"title": "Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "The Occultation of Imam al-Mahdi (Arabic: غيبة الإمام المهدي ) refers to the belief that the last and twelfth Shi'a Imam, Imam al-Mahdi (a) , was disappeared. The occultation was conducted at the permission and will of God and is one of the basic and mandatory teachings of the Twelver Shi'a sect. In Hadiths that have discussed the motives behind occultation, the idea of putting the Shi'a to test has been cited. According to Shi'a teachings, Imam al-Mahdi (a) has had two occultations: The Minor Occultation , which lasted sixty nine lunar years , and the Major Occultation , which continues to the present day. During the Minor Occultation, Imam al-Mahdi (a) communicated with the Shi'a through the four deputies , but during the Major Occultation this communication does not exist and the Shi'a must refer to the scholars for their religious needs. In order to explain occultation, Shi'a researchers have written numerous books on the issue, the most famous of which are al-Nu'mani's book on occultation ( Al-Ghayba ) and al-Shaykh al-Tusi 's Book on occultation ( Kitab al-Ghayba ). Defining the Topic According to Shi'a belief, God never leaves the earth without His deputy, the ultimatum, and infallible Imam. After the martyrdom of the eleventh Imam (a) in 260 /874, the twelfth Imam, Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-'Askari (a), who was born in 255 /869, inherited the position. By God's knowledge and will, the twelfth Imam disappeared from sight in 260 /874, although he is still alive and shall reappear one day to free the world from the violence and injustice that fills it, in order to place justice and fairness instead. Lexical Definition The word ghayba ( غَيْبَة , occultation) is derived from the root \"gh-y-b\" ( غ ی ب ). Its definition is opposite to presence and is used to convey disappearance from sight and camouflage . Minor Occultation The Minor Occultation is the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) was in occultation after his father's martyrdom, in 260/874, to 329/941. The Imam (a) helped his followers spiritually, and guided them through his deputies, who are called the Four Deputies . Major Occultation The Major Occultation is the period when Imam al-Mahdi (a) went into the second phase of his occultation after the death of his fourth deputy, 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri . There is no interval between Minor Occultation and Major Occultation, and the only difference is that contrary to the period of Minor Occultation, in this period, Imam (a) has no specific deputy, and Shi'a people should refer to the scholars for their religious affairs. The Occultation is divided into two periods to show the lack of connection with Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the second period. According to Shi'a belief, although the Imam is in occultation, the world and those in it all benefit from the blessing of his existence. In other words, the world needs an Imam who has been chosen by God in order to exist. This Imam does not just hold the legislative wilaya (al-wilaya al-tashri'iyya) of this world, but also has the generative wilaya (al-wilaya al-takwiniyya) as well . Therefore, some of the dominant Shi'a sources have a chapter on انَّ الْأَئِمَّةَ هُمْ أَرْكَانُ الْأَرْضِ which means, the Imams are the pillars of earth . Representatives at the Age of Occultation According to Shi'a teachings, it is obligatory that God appoints an Imam. This belief results from two principles; Rational good and badness and the Principle of Grace . This is why the Imam , who has the duty to lead the worldly and religious lives of the human beings, must be chosen by God. At the era when the infallible and chosen Imam is not present in the community, the duty is put on the shoulders of the scholars whom have the conditions for this position to represent him. Leading the human race, according to the Shi'a , is a divine covenant and command, therefore, authority should be established from God, His Prophet, and the infallible successors who have been chosen by God. Reasons and Philosophy of Occultation Shi'a researchers believe that all the reasons and secrets for the occultation are not known, but the hadith emphasize on three things: 1. To Test the Faithful Based on Islamic sources, testing the creation and choosing the righteous ones of them, is one of the constant traditions of God. Life is full of tests for the pious whom use it to nurture their faith , patience and obeying of God's commands and reach perfection by flourishing their talents and abilities. Imam al-Mahdi's (a) occultation is a means to test; as the facade falls from the people with unstable belief, their doubts and uncertainty shall take over, while those whose belief have rooted into their hearts, shall become more experienced and worthy in faith and reach higher levels of piety and divine reward , as they bear through the troubles of time, awaiting the Imam. A narration from Imam Musa b. Ja'far (a) clearly expresses that God tests his creatures, by occultation . The narrations declared that testing people in the time of occultation is of the most difficult testings. The troubles of this test are for two reasons: First: When the period of occultation becomes lengthy, many people will face doubts and uncertainties. Some will doubt his birth, while others question whether he is still alive, but only the honest who have already passed their previous tests and have reached deep understanding will preserve their belief about the Imam. In a long hadith, the Prophet (s) mentions this issue and says, \"Al-Mahdi shall disappear from the sight of the Shi'a and his followers, and no one shall stay stable on their belief, except those who God has put their hearts on the path of faith, and made it worthy.\" Second: The troubles and pressures of the end of times will change the people to the extent that preserving faith and religion shall be a hard objective to achieve. The faith which the people hold will be seriously in danger . 2. To Save the Imam's Life A loot into some narrations suggests that God saved the Imam from the danger of being killed, by occultation, for had he appeared from the very beginning of his life, he would have been killed. Based on the same logic, if he appears before the time is right, his life will be in danger and shall fail to fulfill his Godly objectives and the great reformations he was created to make . 3. Being Free from Accepting the Leadership of the Illegitimate Ruler According to some narrations, the twelfth Imam shall not recognize any oppressive government, even as a dissimulation. He is not obliged to perform Taqiyya ( precautionary dissimulation) for any leader or king, and shall not live under the flag of any oppressor. He will perform God's rulings with no compromise, concern, or secrecy. In other words, he will be in occultation until he rises and thus be free from allegiance or loyalty to any leader or government.

{"title": "Sacred Side", "text": "The Sacred Side or Al-Nāḥīya al-Muqaddasa (Arabic: الناحیَة المُقَدَّسَة ) is a secret word used by the Shi'a since the first half of the 3rd/ ninth century until the end of the Minor Occultation ( 329 /941). It refers to al-'Askariyyayn ( Imam al-Hadi (a) and Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) ) and Imam al-Mahdi (a) or to Special Deputies . In many letters by the three Imams (a), the word, \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\", is used to refer to the Imam. Two ziyarah texts of Imam al-Husayn (a) are referred to as ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa . Notion The Arabic term \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\" (lit. the Sacred Side) was used by the Shi'a since the first half of the 3rd/ninth century, during the imamate of Imam al-Hadi (a) until the end of the Minor Occultation (329/941), because of tough political and social circumstances of the Shi'a and restrictions placed by Abbasid Caliphs on social communications of Imams. When they cited the sayings of or talked about Imam al-Hadi (a), Imam al-'Askari (a) or Imam al-Mahdi (a), the Shi'a used the term \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\", instead of the Imam's (a) name. Thus, the use of this term to refer to Imam al-Mahdi (a) or his Special Deputies is believed to be out of taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation). The term was used during the Minor Occultation as a title for Imam al-Mahdi (a). 'Ali b. 'Isa al-Irbili takes \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\" to be a secret word used by the Shi'a to refer to Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Letters The term, \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\", was used by people who wrote letters to, and received replies ( tawqi' ) from Imam al-Hadi (a), Imam al-'Askari (a) or Imam al-Mahdi (a). Some letters are cited in Shiite hadith collections written to or received from \"al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\". Al-'Allama al-Majlisi compiled a book under Tawqi'at al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa (letters of The Sacred Side) in which letters from Imam al-Mahdi (a) to the Shi'a are collected. Ziyarahs There are two ziyarah texts of Imam al-Husayn (a) narrated from Imam al-Mahdi (a) , known as \"Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa\". One of which is referred to as the well-known Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa, and the other is known as the lesser known Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa. The well-known ziyarah was transmitted by one of the Special Deputies and is cited in a number of sources, including al-Mazar by al-Shaykh al-Mufid , al-Mazar al-kabir by Ibn al-Mashhadi , and Bihar al-anwar . The lesser known Ziyarah al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa is also known as Ziyarah al-Shuhada' (ziyarah of the martyrs) because Imam al-Husayn's (a) martyred companions are mentioned therein.

{"title": "Signs of Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a)", "text": "Signs of Reappearance (Arabic: علامات الظهور , transliteration: 'Alamat al-Zuhur) are those events which have been predicted by the Infallibles (a) to happen before or on the verge of the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the happening of each of them is considered a good news for approaching his uprising in the world; so that, he (a) will rise after the last in the series of these signs happen. The Siren , rising of Sufyani , etc. are among these signs. Relation with 'Ashrat al-Sa'ah Since the uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is considered among the events before the Judgment Day in religious sources, so some of the sign of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are also considered as Indications of the Hour ('Ashrat al-Sa'a). Number In religious sources, there are many natural, unnatural and socio-political events have been mentioned as the signs of reappearance . It is clear that the validity of all these signs is not the same. Some of the narrations mentioning these signs exist in authentic sources and they are authentic regarding the reference and argument. Some others are mentioned either in non-authentic books or by unreliable people. Some of these signs are just signs of reappearance and some are also signs before the Judgment Day. Some signs are general and essential and some others are details and minor issues which can be categorized under one title. What seems to be important is that frequency of these narrations assures us that on the verge of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) some events will occur, some of which will be significant and world-scale and some others are less important. However, there are some narrations which have mentioned some signs together. Types Signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are various and counting all of them is neither useful nor necessary; since, many of them are not definite signs of reappearance. Moreover, some of them have problems regarding reference and content and their authenticity is not clear. Therefore, in categorization of the signs, only the following criteria are considered here: Definite and Indefinite Among the signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), some have been mentioned as \"definite\" which are those, occurrence of which is definite without any precondition or prerequisite so that Imam al-Mahdi (a) will not return if they do not happen. From many narrations among which there are authentic hadiths , five signs can be found as definite: Rising of Sufyani , Rising of Yamani , Siren in the sky , murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya (the purified soul) and al-Khasf bi-l-Bayda' (Burying in Bayda). Imam al-Sadiq (a) said, \"five events are signs before the rising of the Riser (al-Qa'im): Siren in the sky, rising of Sufyani, Khasf bi-l-Bayda', rising of Yamani, murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya.\" There are also signs which are indefinite, i.e. they depend on other events to happen. In other words, indefinite signs may or may not happen before Imam al-Mahdi (a) comes. Some signs which have not been declared as definite are: Different causes of death Frequent earthquakes Wars and worldwide uprisings Unexpected lunar and solar eclipse Heavy rains Preceding and Non-preceding Based on some hadiths , some signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) are just preceding to it so that there is not a long time between happening them and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Although, it is not clear how long is the time between happening them and reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), but it is not long for sure and most probably such signs happen in the same year of reappearance or the year before it. Therefore, there is no doubt that some signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) happen near or just before reappearance of imam al-Mahdi (a) and there are some other signs which will happen in the period of the Major Occultation . Unusual Signs Happening of the signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) is in a natural manner, but the prediction of some of them suggests that their happening is naturally impossible and they will happen as miracles such as rising of the sun from the West and the siren from sky which will be miracles if their apparent meanings are intended. However, they might have a figurative meaning and refer to events which naturally happen. It should be said that there are many narrations about the signs of reappearance, but their references are weak and unreliable and there is not firm reasoning connection between them. It seems that the great importance of the issue of Mahdism on the one hand, and the great interest of Muslims in knowing how future events and signs of reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) happen on the other hand have made the enemies, especially cruel rulers, alter and distort in narrations in order to achieve their own political interests. Now we have a multitude of authentic and non-authentic narrations about reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a), at least some of which have been altered and distorted. Unfortunately, there are also some books which either ignorantly or intentionally help this confusion. However, there are cases of forgery or distortion about the signs of reappearance or emerging False Claimants as a sign which can never invalidate all narrations or signs since some of them are definite and authentic. Ambiguity Some of the signs are clear regarding meaning and message, while some others are very ambiguous and complicated to understand. Many contemporary authors have mentioned these narrations and tried to interpret them based on their personal opinions. However, many of such authors do not have the scholarly competence to interpret these narrations and thus following such personal interpretations. A beneficial example is as follows: When discussing the signs of reappearance in al-Irshad , al-Shaykh al-Mufid writes, \"…and coming of Turks to the island and coming of Romans to the desert…\" Currently, Turks are in Iran , North of Iraq , Caucasus and Azerbaijan , so what does the phrase mean? And who are these Turks? What does \"the island\" mean? Today, Romans can include all the Europe and they even can include Americans since they immigrated from Europe. Also, words \"West\" or \"East\" have been mentioned in narrations and the question is what do they mean? Far East? Middle East? Far West? Or West of Arab countries including Libya , Tunisia , Algeria and Morocco ? In any case, it cannot definitely be said who or where the names in these narrations refer to today and it is needed to wait for the time to define these signs as there are.

{"title": "Special Deputyship", "text": "Special deputiship (Arabic: النیابة الخاصّة , al-Nīyāba al-Khāṣṣa) is the appointment of someone as a deputy of the Imam al-Mahdi (a) in order for people to contact him when it is not feasible for them to directly contact the Imam (a). In these circumstances, the Imam (a) appoints particular persons as his deputies. The special deputy should be introduced to people either by the Imam (a) himself or by a previous special deputy. Some historians take \"niyaba\" to imply absolute succession, and they believe that only Imam al-Mahdi's (a) special deputies during the Minor Occultation , known as the Four Deputies (\"al-nuwwab al-arba'a\"), count as \"na'ib\" (special deputy) and absolute successors of the Imam (a). According to this view, even the highest-ranking representatives of the Imams (a) in the period of their presence do not count as their absolute surrogates and special deputies, because people still had direct contacts with the Imams (a) in those periods. Thus, they are referred to as the Imam's (a) ambassadors or representatives (wakil). The special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) were four people: 'Uthman b. Sa'id , Muhammad b. 'Uthman , al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti , and 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri . When the Minor Occultation began, a number of the Shi'as and certain companions of Imam al-Mahdi (a) pretended that they were special deputies of Imam (a). Some of them were mentioned in a letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in which false deputies are reproached and cursed . The false claim to the position of special deputyship was not limited to the period of the Minor Occultation. Some people falsely claimed to be special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of Major Occultation as well. Notion The term, \"nāʾib\" (Arabic: نائب ) is used to mean a successor, a surrogate, or a deputy. According to one view, the use of the term to mean bab , absolute representative, and the only mediator between Imam al-Mahdi (a) and the Shi'as is restricted to the four deputies in the period of the Minor Occultation , and the representatives of the Imams (a) during their presence were not called \"na'ib\", because there was still a direct contact between the Imams (a) and the Shi'as although those people served as representatives or babs of the Imams (a). Thus, the highest-ranking representatives of the Imams (a) in the period of their presence do not count as \"na'ib\", successors, or absolute surrogates of the Imam (a). One piece of evidence for this view is the use of the term, \"wakīl\" (Arabic: وکیل , representative), for 'Uthman b. Sa'id in the period of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) , and the use of the term, \"na'ib\" (deputy), for him in the period of Imam al-Mahdi (a) by Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi . Imam al-Mahdi's (a) Special Deputies Four companions of the Imams (a) were appointed as special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) in the period of the Minor Occultation. On behalf of Imam al-Mahdi (a), they were successively in contact with the Imam's (a) representatives in the most distant areas of the Islamic territories and delivered the messages and requests of the Shi'as to the Imam (a) and the replies of the Imam (a) to the Shi'as. The first special deputy of the Imam al-Mahdi (a) was Uthman b. Sa'id al-Amri . After his death in 265 /878, he was succeeded by his son, Muhammad b. Uthman as the second special deputy of the Imam (a). Muhammad b. Uthman served as the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a) for forty years. Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti and Ali b. Muhammad al-Samuri were the third and the fourth special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) who served in this position for twenty one and three years, respectively. When the period of the Minor Occultation ended in 329 /941, the period of special deputies ended as well. Pretenders of the Position of Special Deputy Throughout the history, some companions of the Imams (a) and other Shi'as pretended to be special deputies of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Some of them are mentioned in a letter from Imam al-Mahdi (a) in which pretenders of the position of special deputy are reproached and cursed. Al-Shalmaghani Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Abi l-'Azaqir, known as al-Shalmaghani, was a companion of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) and a Shiite muhaddith in Baghdad in the period of the Minor Occultation. He is mentioned in a letter of Imam al-Mahdi (a) to Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti in which pretenders of the position of \"niyaba\" (special deputy) are reproached and cursed and the Shi'as are warned not to follow them. Al-Shari'i Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Shari'i was a companion of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a). He was the first person who pretended to be a special deputy, attributed false remarks to the Shiite Imams (a) , and exaggerated about them. He is mentioned in a letter by Imam al-Mahdi (a) in which pretenders of the position of special deputy are reproached and cursed. Muhammad b. Nusayr al-Namiri Muhammad b. Nusayr al-Namiri was a companion of Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a). After al-Shari'i, he pretended to be the special deputy. His claim led Muhammad b. 'Uthman al-'Amri , the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a), to curse him. Muhammad b. Ali b. Balal Abu Tahir Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Balal was a Shiite scholar of jurisprudence , theology , and hadith , a companion of Imam al-Hadi (a) , and a representative of the Eleventh Imam (a) . He was such a great scholar that even al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti , the third special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a), consulted him with regard to some theological problems and was considered as one of his students. Another student of his was Ali b. Ibrahim al-Qummi . He did not accept the position of Uthman b. Sa'id as the special deputy and pretended that he was the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Ahmad b. Hilal al-Karkhi Ahmad b. Hilal al-Karkhi, known as \"al-'Abarta'i\", was a companion of the Tenth and the Eleventh Imams (a). Al-Shaykh al-Tusi mentioned him among the pretenders of the position of special deputy. He accepted the position of Uthman b. Sa'id as the special deputy, but denied the \"niyaba\" of his son, Muhammad b. 'Uthman . In a letter from Imam al-Mahdi (a) to al-Husayn b. Ruh al-Nawbakhti, Ahmad b. Hilal is cursed by the Imam (a) because of his denial of the Muhammad b. Uthman's \"niyaba\". However, in his al-Fihrist , al-Shaykh al-Tusi has only pointed to his being a Ghali (that is, a person who exaggerates about Imams), without mentioning his claim to be a special deputy. Al-Najjashi believes that Ahmad b. Hilal was reproached by Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a). There were correspondences between him and Imam al-Askari (a). Al-Husayn b. Mansur al-Hallaj Al-Husayn b. Mansur al-Hallaj was a well-known Sufi in the 3rd/9th and 4th/10th centuries. His conflicts with the Abbasid Caliphate and his execution on the basis of a fatwa by Sunni jurists imply that he was an Imami or, at least, he had Shiite tendencies. He tried to gather the Shi'as around himself and, to some extent, he succeeded to gather a number of Shi'as who had Sufi tendencies, but Imami scholars in Qom and Baghdad strongly rejected his invitations. Al-Hallaj's claim to be the special deputy of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and a letter he sent to people of Qom to follow him led Abu l-Hasan 'Ali b. al-Husayn b. Babawayh , the father of al-Shaykh al-Saduq and the authority of the Shi'as in Qom in the 4th/10th century, to tear the letter apart and strongly reproach al-Hallaj. He finally deported al-Hallaj from Qom. Al-Hallaj also sent a letter to Abu Sahl al-Nawbakhti , the leader of the Shi'as in Baghdad, in which he claimed to be the special deputy of the Twelfth Imam (a) and invited the Shi'as of Baghdad to follow him. Abu Sahl opposed al-Hallaj's invitation. Al-Hallaj was eventually disgraced after he failed to meet al-Nawbakhti's request to show a miracle by turning the latter's white hair into black.

{"title": "Uprising of al-Khurasani", "text": "The Uprising of al-Khurāsānī (Arabic: خروج الخُراسانيّ ) is a sign of Imam al-Mahdi ’s (a) reappearance . This is an uprising that will be led by a person from Khorasan simultaneously with al-Sufyani ’s and al-Yamani ’s uprisings. Some researchers believe that al-Khurasani has black flags , and his army will defeat al-Sufyani under Shu'ayb b. Salih ’s commandership. There are disagreements between researchers on Mahdism about the black flags. Some believe that the black flags are the same as Abu Muslim al-Khurasani ’s flags in his uprising against the Umayyad government . Others believe that they refer to the uprising that occurs before Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance. Al-Sayyid al-Khurasani An uprising by a person from Khorasan is mentioned as a sign of Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance in the relevant hadiths . The term \"Khurasani\" has its sources in hadiths about Khorasan, the eastern land, and a man who starts an uprising with people of Khorasan. These hadiths do not mention al-Khurasani’s characteristics, including his prophetical descent (being a Sayyid ). However, in his book, 'Asr al-zuhur (The age of reappearance), Ali al-Kourani claims that, in Sunni as well as later Shiite sources, al-Khurasani is said to descend from Imam al-Hasan (a) or Imam al-Husayn (a) , and is referred to as \"al-Khurasani al-Hashimi\". Because of this, he is also known as al-Sayyid al-Khurasani. Moreover, these sources provide further descriptions of al-Khurasani, including a mole on his right cheek and his right hand. Is al-Khurasani’s Uprising a Sign of Reappearance? The uprising by al-Khurasani is a sign of Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance along with Heavenly Cry (a voice from the sky), murder of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya , the Uprising of al-Sufyani , and al-Khasf al-Bayda' . According to a hadith attributed to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , al-Khurasani, al-Sufyani, and al-Yamani will simultaneously start uprisings, in the same year, in the same month, and on the same day. According to hadiths, al-Khurasani’s uprising starts from the east (eastern parts of Islamic lands) and will proceed toward Iraq . The Encyclopedia of Imam al-Mahdi casts doubts on the reliability of the chains of transmissions of these hadiths. Black Flags and al-Sayyid al-Khurasani The parade of Black Flags is the uprising by people who hold black flags in eastern lands, which is mentioned in some hadiths as a sign of reappearance. According to some hadiths, the flags belong to youths from Banu Hashim in Khorasan, who accompany Shu'ayb b. Salih in his uprising. Some Shiite researchers believe that the black flags are those of Abu Muslim al-Khurasani ’s uprising against the Umayyad government, which led to the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate . Others hold that the flags point to an uprising that occurs before Imam al-Mahdi’s reappearance. The author of ' Asr al-zuhur says that al-Sayyid al-Khurasani has black flags, the commander of his army is Shu'ayb b. Salih, and a war breaks out between his and al-Sufyani’s army, in which the latter is defeated. Al-Sayyid al-Khurasani pledges his allegiance to Imam al-Mahdi (a). This account was disputed on the grounds that, in the book ' Asr al-zuhur , a recourse is made to hadiths from Ibn al-Hammad’s al-Fitan , in which al-Khurasani does not appear. Moreover, al-Fitan is not deemed reliable by Shiite scholars, because many of its hadiths were not issued by the Infallibles (a) .

{"title": "Raj'a", "text": " Rajʿa (Arabic: الرَّجعَة ), is the belief that a group of people who have died will return to the Earth shortly after the reappearance of the twelfth Shi'a Imam, al-Mahdi (a) . It is a belief particular to the Shi'a Muslims. The Qur'an has mentioned the story of some people who have been resurrected after death. Based on some hadiths , a number of perfect believers as well as a number of complete infidels will return to this world. The return of Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) has been especially emphasized. Since there are mutawatir hadiths about raj'a, it is a certain fact. However, details about raj'a are not as certain. Etymology The word \"raj'a\" literally means 'to return'. In the Qur'an and narrations different terms have been used to refer to this doctrinal principle such as raj'a, karra, radd, hashr. However, raj'a is the most popular term. This form of Arabic infinitive (masdar al-marra) for raj'a translates into 'returning once, or to return once'. In Shi'a Beliefs As a technical term used in Islamic discourse and science, raj'a has been coined to represent the belief that at the time of Imam al-Mahdi's reappearance , God will bring back to life a number the deceased to the world with their worldly body. Creating an opportunity for the believers to reach their ultimate perfection is mentioned among the reasons behind raj'a. According to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) , those believers who do not achieve the blessing of martyrdom will achieve it during their raj'a. The purpose of this returning to life is for the Shi'as to aid and help the Imam (a) in his mission and for them to witness the establishment of his righteous government. Similarly, God will also bring back to life a number of the Imam's enemies so that they may taste the punishment of this world and witness, much to their regret, the glory and power of Imam al-Mahdi (a) 's government . Raj'a is considered one of the necessary components of the Shi'a belief system. Al-Sharif al-Murtada , a Shi'a scholar and theologian , says, \"The Twelver Shi'as are of the belief that at the time of Imam al-Mahdi's reappearance, God will bring back to a life a group among the believers, so that they may benefit from the righteous government of al-Mahdi (a), and gain the rewards of helping him and aiding him in establishing this government. A group from among the enemies will also be brought back to life, so that revenge can be taken on them.\" 'Allama Tabataba'i writes in al-Mizan , \"Although the non-Shi'a denominations, accept the belief in the reappearance of al-Mahdi (a), and have widely reported ( mutawatir ) narrations from the Prophet (s) in this regard, they reject the issue of raj'a, and see this to be a belief particular to the Shi'as.\" In Qur'an According to Shi'a theologians and Qur'anic commentators, there are verses in the Qur'an that speak about raj'a. Five verses refer to the resurrection of the dead in the past, these verses confirm the possibility of raj'a. Raising of the seventy companions of Prophet Musa (a) [1] Resurrection of 'Uzayr after one hundred years [2] Revival of a murdered person from the Israelites [3] Revival of thousands of people [4] Raising the dead by Jesus (a) [5] Some verses speak about the happening of raj'a in the future: The Qur'an 27 :83 is about a day in which a group from every nation will be resurrected, the verse is not about the Day of Judgement as on the Day of Judgement all people will be resurrected not just certain groups of them [6] The Qur'an 40 :11 quotes from the faithless in the Day of Judgement that they had died twice and had been revived twice. The two deaths and revivals show that they had experienced raj'a before the Day of Judgement [7] In Hadiths In his Bihar al-anwar , al-'Allama al-Majlisi mentions over one-hundred and sixty verses and narrations on the topic of raj'a. After quoting these hadiths, he says, \"For those who have faith in the words of the Imams (a), no room for doubt remains that raj'a is a true concept. The reason being, that the reports that have been collated from the Imams (a) on this matter are at the level of tawatur .The author of the Qur'anic exegesis Al-Mizan , 'Allama Tabataba'i , believes that these reports have reached a level of tawatur in meaning. So much so that even if a few of these reports were to be problematic or unclear, it would not affect the tawatur of the reports. Furthermore, the idea of raj'a appears in many of the recorded Ziyarahs and supplications, including the Al-Ziyara al-Jami'a al-Kabira , Ziyara Warith , Ziyara Arba'in , Ziyara Al Yasin , and Ziyara Rajabiyya , also the supplications of Wida' and 'Ahd . It is noteworthy to say that while Shi'as believe in raj'a, they do not consider the rejecters of raj'a as non-Muslim ( Kafir ), since raj'a is a necessary belief to be Shi'a, not Muslim, meaning the rejecter will still be in the fold of Islam. It is understood from a number of reports that belief in raj'a is a condition for perfect faith and true Islam. The Time of Raj'a About the time of raj'a, there are three possibilities: shortly before the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam (a); simultaneously with his reappearance; shortly after the reappearance. In some hadiths, whose chains of transmitters are weak, the time of raj'a is alluded to by the quite famous saying \"All wonders [take place] between Jumada and Rajab \" ( اَلْعَجَبُ كُلُّ الْعَجَبِ بَینَ جُمَادَی وَ رَجَب ). However, it is not possible to ascertain the exact time of, and the order of the events related to, raj'a. Those Who Will Experience Raj'a Although there is no doubt that raj'a will take place, as it is backed by widely transmitted hadiths, its details, including the number and identity of those who will return, are not certain. However, the majority of scholars maintain that during raj'a, only the Prophet (s) , the Imams (a) , and the pure believers and unbelievers will return. Prophets and Believers before the Advent of Islam According to some hadiths, Daniel (a) (Daniyal), Joshua (a) (Yusha'), Jesus (a) ('Isa), and Khidr are among those who will return. Also, it is mentioned that some believers and followers of the previous religions, such as the People of the Cave , will return. Return of Jesus Both Shi'a and Sunni sources state that the Jesus (a) will return at the time of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . It can be understood from the traditions with certainty that Jesus (a) will return after the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and will pray behind him. According to some traditions, the Imam (a) will give Jesus (a) the leadership and governance of a part of the world. Sunni sources indicate that the duration of the return of Jesus (a) will be forty years. According to some hadiths, Qur'an 4 :159, \"There is none among the People of the Book but will surely believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them.\" is related to the return of Jesus (a). The Prophet (s), Ahl al-bayt (a), and Their Companions The Prophet (s) will return together with Imam Ali (a) . According to some hadiths, all the Imams (a) and some of their companions, such as Salman , Miqdad , Jabir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansari , Malik al-Ashtar , al-Mufaddal b. 'Umar , Humran b. A'yan , Muyassir b. 'Abd al-Aziz , and the companions of Imam al-Husayn (a) , will return. Some other hadiths state that pure believers and unbelievers will return, without giving any specific names. Several Returns of Imam Ali (a) According to sixs hadiths, which do not have reliable chains of transmitters, Imam Ali (a) will return several times. And after punishing the enemies, he will rule the earth. The First Returners In Tafsir al-'Ayyashi , the first returners are said to be Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions. A hadith in Bihar al-Anwar , which reports the conversation between Imam al-Husayn (a) and his companions on the eve of Ashura , includes a description of what will happen at the time of raj'a. In another hadith, Imam al-Husayn (a) is with Imam al-Mahdi (a) when the latter passes away; Imam al-Husayn (a) perforsm burial rituals for him and then continues his rule for forty years. However, according to some other hadiths, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will be the last ruler. In some other hadiths, the first returner is said to be Imam Ali (a), but considering the hadiths that talk about several returns for Imam Ali (a), it is possible to infer that Imam Ali (a) will be the first returner before the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) will be the first returner after the reappearance. History in Shi'a Denominations In some reports, it has been recorded that shortly after the martyrdom of Imam 'Ali (a) , a group of people from Iraq developed the belief that Imam Ali (a) would return to this world before the final resurrection. Similar beliefs developed in different Shi'a denominations after the death or martyrdoms of personalities like Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya , Imam al-Kazim (a) , and Imam al-Hasan al-'Askari (a) . In Other Religions The concept of raj'a can be found in the Old Testament . The Book of Ezekiel for instance, points towards the coming back to life of the Israelites and the rule of David (a) in the end of times . In the Book of Daniel, it is reported that 'In the end of times, many of those who are asleep within the earth will be awoken' . The New Testament also speaks about the returning to life of the righteous people and the establishment of the Messiah 's rule in the first resurrection, before the coming of the second resurrection . Related Works Due to the great importance of raj'a in the Shiite theological belief system, Shi'a scholars and narrators have written numerous books and treatises on the topic. Unfortunately, many of these works are no longer available to us, and have been lost. Now, only their names remain in the books of rijal and fihrist (lists of authors and their works). Aqa Buzurg Tihrani introduces thirty works written on this topic. Some of the most important ones that have been published are as follows: Al-Raj'a ; Mirza Muhammad Mu'min b. Dust Muhammad Husayni Astarabadi (annotated by Faris Hassun Karim and published by Anwar al-Huda Publications, 1417 /1996-7). Mirza Muhammad Mu'min was martyred in Mecca in the year 1088 /1677-8). In this work, after a short introduction regarding the necessity of turning to the Infallible Imams (a) in all affairs, and submitting to their words, Mirza Muhammad presents more than a hundred narrations on the topic of raj'a. Al-Iqaz min al-haj'a bi l-burhan 'ala l-raj'a ; Shaykh Muhammad b. Hasan al-Hurr al-'Amili (d. 1104 /1692-3). This book was authored in 1075 /1664-5; it contains over one-hundred and seventy narrations, including tens of verses and other proofs to establish the concept of raj'a. Raj'at ; Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi (d. 1111 /1699-700). This book was written in Persian. It contains fourteen narrations pertaining to the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam , al-Mahdi (a), and the topic of raj'a. It is worth noting that al-'Allama al-Majlisi has addressed in detail the issue of raj'a within his other famous work Bihar al-anwar . He presents approximately two-hundred narrations that have been reported on this topic . Al-Shi'a wa l-raj'a ; Muhammad Rida Tabasi Najafi (d. 1405 /1984-1985). This book was published in the year 1378 /1958-9 by al-Matba'a al-Haydariyya Publishers, Najaf . The book consists of theoretical, historical, linguistical, and ethical discussions, with research and analysis. In this book, the status of raj'a in the Qur'an , reported supplications, reported salutations ( Ziyarah ), the consensus of the scholars and the view of reputable figures, has been analyzed and reviewed. In the first chapter of this book, one-hundred and seventy-four verses of the Qur'an that have been interpreted as referring to raj'a according to the narrations, have been mentioned alongside the relevant narrations.

{"title": "Barzakh", "text": " Barzakh (Arabic: بَرزَخ ) is a world between this world and hereafter ; it is also called the imaginal world or the world of grave . Brazakh exists for both believers and non-believers, though it is similar to the Heaven for the former, and similar to the Hell for non-believers. Meaning 'Barzakh' in Arabic literally means an interval or a barrier between two things, and technically it means an interval between the end of this-worldly life (death) and the beginning of hereafter. The world is called 'Barzakh' because it is an interval between this world and the hereafter. The world is also called the world of grave and the imaginal world. In the Qur'an The word 'Barzakh' has been mentioned three times in the Qur'an . but only in Qur'an 23 :100 it has been used in the meaning in question: “ حَتَّى إِذَا جَاء أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ (۹۹) لَعَلِّی أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِیمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّا إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَائِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى یوْمِ یبْعَثُونَ \"When death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord! Take me back (99) that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.' 'By no means! These are mere words that he says.' And ahead of them is a Barzakh until the day they will be resurrected.\" ” — Qur'an, Qur'an 23:99-100 According to this verse of the Qur'an, the request of some people at the time of their death to return to the world in order to do the good deeds that they have not done is not in place, and they face a barrier or an interval—a Barzakh—until the Day of Judgment . The phrase \"until the day they will be resurrected\" indicates that Barzakh is an interval between this world and the hereafter, that anyone experiences after their death and before the Day of Judgment. Proof in the Qur'an In addition to verse 100 of Qur'an 23 that explicitly shows the existence of Barzakh, some verses prove Barzakh without mentioning the word 'Barzakh'. These verses concern the life of martyrs after their deaths: And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their lord. [5] And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive. [6] Moreover, according to Qur'anic verses, Barzakh is not restricted to martyrs—a sinner like Pharaoh and his friends also experience Barzakh: In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the day that judgment will be established: 'cast ye the people of pharaoh into the severest penalty! ( Qur'an 23 :46) [7] The verse obviously points to a penalty for Pharaoh and his people before the penalties of the Day of Judgment, and that is the penalty in Barzakh. In Hadiths Definition In some hadiths , the word 'Barzakh' is used to mean an interval between this world and the hereafter. For instance, according a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , all (true) Shiites will go to the Heaven in the hereafter, and, the hadith goes on, 'I swear to God that I fear about you in Barzakh'. A person asked him about Barzakh, and Imam answered: '[it is] the grave, from one's death to the Day of Judgment'. This latter statement implies that the world of grave is the world of Barzakh —indeed, grave in this hadith does not mean a certain hole in the earth; it is a metaphor for Barzakh. Barzakh's Heaven and Hell Some hadiths state that the world of Barzakh has its own heaven and hell in which people are rewarded or punished for their deeds. The Prophet (s) says: \"the grave is either a garden of heaven or a hole of hell\". Question of the Grave A number of hadiths show that once people enter the world of Barzakh, they are questioned about their beliefs and deeds. This questioning is known as \"the question of the grave\". Barzakhi Body Human soul attaches to an imaginal or Barzakhi body. An imaginal body is one that is not of a material kind, and yet enjoys some characteristics of material objects, such as shape and size. In these respects, the imaginal body is like a person's natural body. In order to have a clear picture of an imaginal or Barzakhi body, one might reflect on the forms or images that one observes while dreaming. Such forms are undoubtedly non-material; they do not occupy any space and they do not have any mass, and yet they have a shape and a size and they have forms like those of material objects.

{"title": "Qiyamat Sughra", "text": "Al-Qiyamah al-Ṣughra (the Lesser Resurrection) (Arabic: القیامة الصغری ) refers to the period between death and al-Qiyamah al-Kubra (the greater Resurrection). Referring to this hadith of the Prophet (s) saying, \"When a person dies, his resurrection will begin\" , some scholars of theology believe that every person has two resurrections: A lesser resurrection and a greater resurrection . The lesser resurrection of a person begins with his death and continues until the greater resurrection. Some theological books use the expression \"al-Qiayamah al-Sughra\" to refer to Barzakh . According to verses of the noble Qur'an , the time of the greater resurrection is unknown and only God knows about it. Fayd Kashani said that as soon as all humans die, the lesser resurrection will end and the greater resurrection will begin; but, the time when all people would die is known only by God. According to hadiths, the lesser resurrection is peculiar to humans, while in the greater resurrection, all beings will be present. In some hadiths and Shi'a books, Raj'a is referred to as the lesser resurrection. In the terminology of Islamic mysticism , the volitional death is referred to as the lesser resurrection.

{"title": "Ruh al-qudus", "text": "Rūḥ al-qudus (Arabc: رُوح‌ُ القُدُس ) or the Holy Spirit , is a being whose nature has been a matter of disagreement among Muslim scholars. Some maintain that it is another name for Gabriel , others take consider is a being from the World of Command, a hidden force, the Active Intellect, the Spirit of the Spirits, or the greatest angel. In Islamic sources, such tasks as conveying revelation to prophets, helping believers , being the source of the knowledge of prophets , being the source from which the Imams (a) receive their knowledge, and intercession on the Day of Judgment have been attributed to the Holy Spirit. In Christianity , the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity and is considered divine by mainstream Christians. The Nature of the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit is the spirit that is free from defects and imperfections. This word is mentioned in the Quran and the Bible. The Quran mentions that the Quran was sent down by the Holy Spirit 3 and that Jesus was supported by it. Muslim scholars disagree as to the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit. Gabriel: Some Quranic commentators consider the Holy Spirit to be Gabriel. [4] Calling Gabriel the Holy Spirit indicates his holiness as well as his role in preserving religion . [5] A being from the World of Command: Allama Tabatabai maintains that the Holy Spirit is not an angel but a being from the World of Command , who would convey revelation to prophets. [6] The greatest angel: According to a hadith attributed to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Holy Spirit is an angel greater than Gabriel and Michael , who accompanied Prophet Muhammad (s) and then the Imams (a). [7] According to other hadiths, the Holy Spirit is the spirit, [8] which, according to the Quran, comes down together with Angels on the Night of Ordainment . [9] A Hidden Force: According to a view, the Holy Spirit is a hidden force [10] with which Jesus (a) revived the dead. A weaker degree of this force exists in other believers as well and helps them in the path of God. [11] The first being: According to Sayyid Haydar Amuli , the Holy Spirit is a name for the first created being. [12] The Spirit of the Spirits: In some mystical works, the Holy Spirit is said to be the Spirit of the Spirits, which is not a created being but rather a face among the faces of God, upon which the essence of created beings depends. [13] Tasks The Quran and hadiths mention a number of tasks for the Holy Spirit. Conveying the revelation to prophets: According to the view that the Holy Spirit is Gabriel, bringing revelation and conveying divine messages were among its tasks. Supporting prophets and the Friends of God: According to a number of Quranic verses the Holy Spirit supported Jesus (a). [14] The source of prophets’ knowledge: According to some hadiths , prophets and Imams have five spirits, and the Holy Spirit is one of them. This spirit is that by which prophets and Imams gain their knowledge. [15] Conveying divine verdict: According to hadiths, the Holy Spirit conveys divine verdicts to the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . [16] Intercession: Based on a hadith from the Prophet (s), the first interceder on the Day of Judgment is the Holy Spirit. [17] Supporting believers: It is stated in some hadiths that the Holy Spirit supports believers as long as they support the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). [18] Ibn Athir reports that the Prophet (s) asked God to support Hassan b. Thabit , a poet who composed poems in defense of the Prophet (s), with the Holy Spirit as long as he supported the Prophet (s). [19] Notes References"}
{"title": "Harut and Marut", "text": "Hārūt and Mārūt (Arabic: هاروت و ماروت ) were two angels who taught magics to people after the death of the Prophet Solomon (a) in order for people to be able to neutralize the magics of evil magicians. But people misused what they learned from the angels. The story is mentioned in the Qur'an 2 , verse 102. Harut and Marut Harut and Marut were two angels sent by God to Babylon : \"and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut\". There is a disagreement over the origin of the terms, \"Harut\" and \"Marut\": Some people believe that the terms come from the Aramaic language. [2] Others take them to be of a Syriac origin, which means monarchical. [3] A number of other people take the terms to be of a Persian origin. [4] There are many tales and stories about Harut and Marut, many of which are taken by scholars and exegetes of the Qur'an to be fake. For example, the story that a woman called \"Zuhra\" deceived Harut and Marut and learned God's Greatest Name and then turned into a star and went to the sky is considered as fake. Teaching Magics According to hadiths , a group of people practiced magics and witchcraft in the period of Solomon (a) . He ordered that all their writings be gathered and kept in a place. After Solomon's (a) death, some of them found the writings and began to learn magics. They said that Solomon (a) was not a prophet and that he just took over the territories and did extraordinary things by magics. They were followed by a number of Israelites . The practice of magics prevailed in Babylon in such a way that people were frustrated and hurt. God sent two angels to them in the form of human persons in order to teach people the magics and the ways of neutralizing them so that they can get rid of the devils of magicians. The Qur'an rejects the claim that Harut and Marut did evil things. It says that the magics was revealed to them, but they intended no harms. They reminded people that \"we are a trial, so do not disbelieve and do not misuse the knowledge\", but people misused the knowledge and disbelieved God. There is a great deal of disagreement over the story of Harut and Marut. In addition to the above account, the following accounts are also offered: Some people believe that Harut and Marut were two angels who blamed human beings because of their sins . God sent them down to the earth in the form of human beings, but they committed sins themselves and were finally punished by God. [13] Hasan al-Basri believed that Harut and Marut were not angels; rather they were two sturdy men from Babylon. [14] They were spirits of the nature at first, and then they turned into angels. They were worshiped by ancient Armenians as two gods. [15] Harut and Marut in non-Islamic Books Armenian Sources and Avesta According to historians, the words, \"Harut\" and \"Marut\", appear in Armenian books, historical books of Egypt , and Slavonic texts of Enoch and the like with remarkable differences. A British historian reported an Armenian source as saying that \"Hurut\" means fertile and \"Murut\" means immortal, referring to two gods of the Mount Masis or Ararat. In an Egyptian myth that he translated, Watts Neld encountered the names, \"Hurvanati\" and \"Amerekati\" which are similar to \"Harut\" and \"Marut\". Accounts in Jewish Sources In his al-Mizan , 'Allama Tabataba'i writes that the story of Harut and Marut corresponds to myths maintained by the Jews about the two angels, and it is not dissimilar to ancient Greek myths about stars. The myth appears in the Second Epistle of Peter: \"For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment.\" Also, in verse 6 of the Epistle of Jude we read: \"And the angels who did not keep their own position, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day\".

In some hadiths , they are called \"the two guardians of the grave\". One of the two angels stands at the right side of the dead and the other at his or her left side, and they start interrogating the dead person by asking questions about his or her beliefs. If the person is an unbeliever or a sinner, then the two angels appear to him or her with a frightening face, and when the true character of the dead is revealed, he or she will face a torture by the frightening angels, called Munkar and Nakir, and the grave will be filled with fire. But if the departed is a believer and pious , then the angels will appear to him or her with a beautiful face, and after the interrogation, they give him or her the good news of going to the Heaven and expand the grave with divine bounties. The angels are, in this case, called \"Mubashshir\" and \"Bashir\". The Face of Munkar and Nakir The appearance of Munkar and Nakir is described in hadiths as follows: they have a voice like a thunderstorm, and eyes like a dazzling light from which fire comes out. They have long and terrifying teeth that reach the ground, their shouts horrifies the dead person to the extreme and makes him or her mute. The way they treat the dead one depends on his or her beliefs, and their appearances change when they face different people. The person's ability to answer their questions depends on the true spirit that he or she had in this world. Sinful believers might have difficulty answering some questions and come to be tortured. Factors that Make It Easier for the Dead to Answer the Questions Expressions such as the \"predicament of Munkar and Nakir\" or the \"horror of Munkar and Nakir\", that are found in hadiths, imply the anxiety or fear that a dead person feels when seeing the two angels. It is recommended to recite Qur'an 67 on behalf of the departed in order to relieve their fears and anxieties. There are some supplications in which God is asked to help one to go through this difficult stage. The family and relatives of the dead person are recommended not to leave him or her alone after their burial. They had better stay with the dead by reciting the Qur'an and supplications, and help him or her answer the questions of Munkar and Nakir. Another factor that helps the dead, in addition to the right beliefs and good actions, is to visit Ahl al-Bayt (a) , especially Imam al-Husayn (a) . This is in fact an appeal to their intercession .

{"title": "Ruh al-qudus", "text": "Rūḥ al-qudus (Arabc: رُوح‌ُ القُدُس ) or the Holy Spirit , is a being whose nature has been a matter of disagreement among Muslim scholars. Some maintain that it is another name for Gabriel , others take consider is a being from the World of Command, a hidden force, the Active Intellect, the Spirit of the Spirits, or the greatest angel. In Islamic sources, such tasks as conveying revelation to prophets, helping believers , being the source of the knowledge of prophets , being the source from which the Imams (a) receive their knowledge, and intercession on the Day of Judgment have been attributed to the Holy Spirit. In Christianity , the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity and is considered divine by mainstream Christians. The Nature of the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit is the spirit that is free from defects and imperfections. This word is mentioned in the Quran and the Bible. The Quran mentions that the Quran was sent down by the Holy Spirit 3 and that Jesus was supported by it. Muslim scholars disagree as to the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit. Gabriel: Some Quranic commentators consider the Holy Spirit to be Gabriel. [4] Calling Gabriel the Holy Spirit indicates his holiness as well as his role in preserving religion . [5] A being from the World of Command: Allama Tabatabai maintains that the Holy Spirit is not an angel but a being from the World of Command , who would convey revelation to prophets. [6] The greatest angel: According to a hadith attributed to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Holy Spirit is an angel greater than Gabriel and Michael , who accompanied Prophet Muhammad (s) and then the Imams (a). [7] According to other hadiths, the Holy Spirit is the spirit, [8] which, according to the Quran, comes down together with Angels on the Night of Ordainment . [9] A Hidden Force: According to a view, the Holy Spirit is a hidden force [10] with which Jesus (a) revived the dead. A weaker degree of this force exists in other believers as well and helps them in the path of God. [11] The first being: According to Sayyid Haydar Amuli , the Holy Spirit is a name for the first created being. [12] The Spirit of the Spirits: In some mystical works, the Holy Spirit is said to be the Spirit of the Spirits, which is not a created being but rather a face among the faces of God, upon which the essence of created beings depends. [13] Tasks The Quran and hadiths mention a number of tasks for the Holy Spirit. Conveying the revelation to prophets: According to the view that the Holy Spirit is Gabriel, bringing revelation and conveying divine messages were among its tasks. Supporting prophets and the Friends of God: According to a number of Quranic verses the Holy Spirit supported Jesus (a). [14] The source of prophets’ knowledge: According to some hadiths , prophets and Imams have five spirits, and the Holy Spirit is one of them. This spirit is that by which prophets and Imams gain their knowledge. [15] Conveying divine verdict: According to hadiths, the Holy Spirit conveys divine verdicts to the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . [16] Intercession: Based on a hadith from the Prophet (s), the first interceder on the Day of Judgment is the Holy Spirit. [17] Supporting believers: It is stated in some hadiths that the Holy Spirit supports believers as long as they support the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). [18] Ibn Athir reports that the Prophet (s) asked God to support Hassan b. Thabit , a poet who composed poems in defense of the Prophet (s), with the Holy Spirit as long as he supported the Prophet (s). [19] Notes References"}
{"title": "Angels", "text": "Angel or Malak (Arabic: مَلَک ) is an invisible supernatural being that serves as God ’s agent in this world and in the hereafter . The belief in the existence of angels is a fundamental Islamic doctrine. Shiite scholars believe that angels are infallible , in the sense that they never disobey God’s commands and never commit sins . Moreover, angels never neglect their duties, which include worship , exalting God , writing the letters of people’s deeds , delivering revelations to prophets , protecting people, assisting the believers , delivering material and spiritual livelihoods, taking people’s lives, guiding people’s hearts, and enforcing the divine punishment . Angels are classified into different groups and levels. Gabriel , Michael , Israfil , and Azrael are superior to other angels. There are theological and exegetical issues over whether angels are superior to humans, whether they are infallible, and whether they are physical or non-physical. There are various views about each of these issues. Muslim scholars disagree over the nature of angels. Muslim theologians believe that angels are physical beings that can take different forms, but Muslim philosophers believe that they are non-physical. The Nature of Angels Angels are entities that mediate between God and the human world. God has appointed them as His agents in the world. The Arabic word for angel is “malak,” the plural form of which is “mala'ika.” There are different views about the nature of angels. Muslim theologians believe that they fine illuminated physical things that can take various forms and shapes. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , most Muslim scholars hold this view, with the exception of some philosophers. Moreover, he believes that prophets and saints could see the angels. However, some philosophers believe that angels are beyond matter and material entities, holding that they have characteristics that cannot be found in physical objects. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , the hadiths about angels taking various forms and shapes are concerned with imaginalization (that is, the appearance of something’s image for someone). Moreover, he believes that there is no valid evidence for the claim that angels and jinn are fine physical objects that take various forms. A hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) says that angels are created from light. Significance and Place The belief in the existence of angels is an Islamic doctrine. The belief in them is like the belief in the prayer and fasting ; that is, it is essential to the belief in prophethood . The term “malak” is used eighty-eight times in the Qur'an. In the Sermon of Skeletons (Khutbat al-Ashbah), Imam 'Ali (a) talks about the creation of angels, their types, characteristics, and tasks. In Bihar al-anwar , there are more than one hundred hadiths about the nature of angels, their tasks, their infallibility, and the characteristics of arch-angels (those closest to God). The third Supplication of al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya by Imam al-Sajjad (a) is about the arch-angels. It says that God’s greeting is the reason why angels are so pure . According to hadiths, angels constitute the largest population among God’s creatures. Many hadiths talk about the large number of angels. Some of them assert that angels were created after the creation of the lights of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) . Some polytheists worshiped angels. They believed that angels were God’s creatures, but they thought that angels were autonomous in their actions and are lords of the inferior beings. Moreover, some polytheists maintained that angels were God’s daughters. Angels in Other Religions Other religions also talk about angels. In Zoroastrianism , angels are believed to be created by Ahura Mazda, Amesha Spenta (arch-angels in Zoroastrianism) being manifestations of His attributes. In Judaism , angels are deemed servants of God as they enforce His commands on the earth and deliver revelation to people. Christians believe that angels were created before humans and serve as their custodians. It is common in Christian churches to greet and worship some angels such as Michael. Tasks The Quran enumerates the tasks of angels as follows: delivering revelation to prophets , administrating the affairs of the world, sending the divine grace to creatures, asking for God’s forgiveness , intercession for believers and helping them, cursing the disbelievers , registering people’s deeds, and taking their lives . There are angels who are constantly engaged in worshiping and exalting God, doing nothing else beside that. Angels are present in the world of Barzakh and the hereafter as well. Some of them inhabit the heaven and some are guardians of the hell . Degrees and Types 'Allama Tabataba'i believes that angels are of different degrees and rankings. Some are ranked lower than others. According to Quranic verses, some of them are agents of the arch-angel of revelation ( Gabriel ) and some are agents of the arch-angel of death ( Azrael ). Mulla Sadra classifies angels into several types, including arch-angels (the closest to God), roaming spirits (al-arwah al-muhayyama), angels responsible for heavenly bodies, intellectual angels, and earthly angels. Imam Khomeini divides them to angels who do not manipulate physical objects (roaming angels and those inhabiting the world of jabarut ) and those responsible for physical beings. Characteristics Here are some of the characteristics of angels. Infallibility According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , Shias believe that angels are infallible and immune to any minor or major sins . This is held by the majority of Sunni Muslims as well. Nevertheless, some Sunni Muslims reject the infallibility of angels, and some of them believe that only some of the angels are infallible, including those who deliver revelation and the arch-angels. Evidence for the infallibility of angels includes the Quranic verse “They do not venture to speak ahead of Him, and they act by His command” and “mighty angels, who do not disobey whatever Allah commands them.” However, some people have cast doubt on the infallibility of angels by making recourse to stories such as Harut and Marut , Iblis’s failure to prostrate for Adam (a), and Futrus ’s disobedience. Shiite scholars have responded to these cases. For instance, the story of the disobedience of Harut and Marut is said to be influenced by myths that do not appear in hadiths and the Qur'an. Moreover, they believe that Iblis was not an angel. Morteza Motahhari says that only some angels might disobey God’s commands. According to Nasir Makarim Shirazi , what appears in some hadiths about punishment of some angels for their dullness in complying with God’s commands does not count as a sin, but just a case of abandoning the better , as is the case about some prophets . 'Allama Tabataba'i holds that angels will whatever God wills, they act upon whatever God commands, and thus they never commit sins. Superiority to Humans Some religious scholars appeal to the Quranic verse “Certainly We have honored the Children of Adam (a), ..., and preferred them with a complete preference over many of those We have created” to argue that angels are superior to humans. Some have adduced the story of angels prostrating before Adam (a) and their being taught by Adam (a) as evidence for the superior of humans to angels, provided that they flourish their potentialities. According to Hasan Hasanzada Amuli , Ibn al-'Arabi believed that the supreme angels (roaming angels) were superior to humans, since they were not obliged to prostrate for Adam (a). Muhammad Dawud al-Qaysari holds that people who achieve the position of God’s vicegerent are even superior to the supreme angels. Mulla Sadra cites verse 31 of Quran 2 about Adam (a) teaching angels as evidence for the superiority of humans to angels who reside in the earth and in the sky, but not to the roaming angels. Superiority of Prophets to Angels Most Muslims believe that prophets are superior to angels, because they are infallible in spite of having irascible and appetitive faculties, unlike the angels. Moreover, Quranic verses such as the prostration of angels before Adam (a) and their being taught by Adam (a) are cited as evidence for the claim. Moreover, Shias believe that their Imams are also superior to angels. Human Manifestation According to Quranic verses, the Trustworthy Spirit appeared to Mary (a) in a human form. Moreover, there are hadiths to the effect that angels manifest in different forms to a person whose life they are about to take, in proportion to whether he or she is a believer or is vicious . Manifestation of angels occurs when they appear in a form other than their original form. No one other than the Prophet (s) has seen angels in their original form. Immateriality Muslim philosophers believe that angels are immaterial. Evidence for their immateriality includes their lack of material properties such as irascible and appetitive faculties, change, transformation, evolution, and being perceptible by senses. Nevertheless, Mulla Sadra disagrees with Quranic exegetes who believe that angels have static positions, claiming that knowledge and virtues of some angels grow over time. Imam 'Ali (a) says that some angels are the most knowledgeable and the closest creatures to God as sleep never falls on their eyes, negligence never happens in their intellect, and tire never occurs in their bodies. Wings On the face of it, some Quranic verses and hadiths imply that angels have wings. There are different accounts of what this means. 'Allama Tabataba'i takes this to mean that angels are equipped with a power by which they move from the sky to the earth, from the earth to the sky, and from any place to any place. It does not mean that they literally have wings like those of birds. [68] Imam Khomeini believes that angels in the supernatural realm are non-physical, immaterial, and hence they have no wings, but those in the imaginal world (ʿAlam al-Mithal) might have imaginal wings and feathers. [69] Ibn al-'Arabi construes the number of an angel’s wings as metaphorical for the extent of its influence in the kingdom of the sky and the earth. [70] Furthermore, the number of an angel’s wings is construed as relevant to their pace in compliance with God’s commands, their power of transition, and an indication of the different degrees of angels.

{"title": "Gabriel", "text": "Gabriel (Arabic: جبرائيل , jabrāʾīl or جِبرِیل , Jibrīl) is one of the four nearest angels to God . Jabra'il carries divine revelations . In addition to carrying the revelation, Jabra'il allegedly helps the prophets , punishes the unbelievers, and consoles the believers. The word \"Jabra'il\" is used in 3 Quranic verses and many hadiths . The significance of Jabra'il is discussed in Islamic philosophy and mysticism . In Islamic philosophy, Jabra'il is identified with the \"Active Intellect\". The angel is also mentioned in Jewish and Christian texts. Literal Meaning The word \"Jabra'il\" has a Hebrew origin. It seems that its Syriac form has entered Arabic. Researchers of the Arabic language have made it explicit that the word is not Arabic. Some Arabic lexicographers have referred to different meanings of \"Jabr\", including a king, servant, brave, and man, and the meaning of \"il\" which refers to God in Hebrew, thus taking \"Jabra'il\" to have two parts, just like \" Mika'il \" and \" Israfil : Jabr + il, which means the man of God or God's servant. In the Qur'an Say, \"Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel [should know that] it is he who has brought it down on your heart with the will of Allah, confirming what has been [revealed] before it, and as a guidance and good news to the faithful.\" Qur'an 2:97 The word \"Jibril\" appears in three verses of the Qur'an , all of which were revealed in Medina . In the Qur'an 2 :97 , it is explicitly mentioned that Jara'il's main task is to carry the divine revelation. However, it is silent on how he carries the revelation. There are other phrases in the Qur'an that its exegetes take to refer to Jabra'il, including: \"Al-Ruh al-amin\" ( الروح الأمين , the Trusted Spirit) , which refers to his trustworthiness in carrying the revelation to prophets. \"Rasul karim\" ( رسول کريم , Dignified Messenger) , which refers to his good characteristics. \"Shadid al-Quwa\" ( شديد القُوَی , Mighty in Power) , \"Dhu Mirra\" ( ذو مِرَّة , possessor of strength) , and \"Dhi Quwwa\" ( ذی قُوَّة , possessor of power), referring to his power to perform divine commands. \"Makin\" ( مَکين , firmly established) and \"Muta'\" ( مُطاع , obeyed) , referring to his special place for God and among other angels. \"Ruh al-Qudus\" ( رُوح القُدُس , the Holy Spirit) . Birth of Jesus According to Quranic verses, Jabra'il had a special role in the birth of the prophet Jesus . He gave the good news of the birth of Jesus to Maryam (a) (Saint Mary) by appearing to her in the form of a man, blowing the divine spirit in her. God empowered and aided Jesus with Jabra'il. Exegetes of the Qur'an agree that Jabra'il contributed to the birth of Jesus by blowing the divine \"spirit\" to Maryam (a). Spirit There is a disagreement about the relation between Jabra'il and the Spirit (Ruh) and what is meant by the Spirit as mentioned in Sura al-Qadr or as asked about in the Qur'an. Some people take the Spirit as an angel in charge of the souls or a creature superior to angels, including Jabra'il, and some people identify the Spirit with Jabra'il, taking the word \"Ruh\" (Spirit) to refer to his superiority to other angels. Criticism of the Jewish Conception According to the Qur'an 2:97-98, the Jews asked the Prophet Muhammad (s) about the angel who descends to him and carries the revelation to him. When they heard that the angel was Jabra'il, they said that the angel was their enemy. It seems that they took Jabra'il to be the angel who brings hardships, punishments, and wars, in contrast to Mika'il who was the angel of mercy and good news for the Jews. Thus, Sura al-Baqara (chapter 2):98 takes the hostility with Jabra'il to amount to enmity with Mika'il, other angels, and even God. The Myth of his betrayal (Khan al-Amin) Some Sunni scholars have falsely attributed to Shi'as the belief that Jabra'il was supposed to carry the revelation to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , but he disobeyed God's orders and carried the revelation to Muhammad (s) . Thus, the accusation against Shi'as continues, they—the Shi'as—raise their arms after saying their prayers and say: \"Khan al-Amin\" ( خانَ الاَمینُ ), that is, the trusted (Jabra'il) has broken his promise. Ibn Taymiyya , a Wahhabi scholar, makes such an accusation against Shi'as. However, Shi'as never believed so. Some Shi'a scholars have responded to such an accusation. The Revelation According to available reports, Jabra'il revealed the first Quranic verses to the Prophet (s) in the Hira' Cave . Then, the Prophet (s) went to his wife, Khadija (a) , and let her know about the revelation made to him. The rest of the story is, nonetheless, a matter of dispute among Shi'as and Sunnis. According to Sunni Muslims: according to several hadiths in Sunni sources, the Prophet (s) doubted whether who he met was the angel of revelation or the Satan . His wife recommended that he go to Waraqa b. Nawfal , a Nazarite who was familiar with religious books. He assured the Prophet (s) that who he saw was the angel who carried the revelation to the prophet Moses (a) . The story is widely accepted by Sunni biographers, scholars of hadiths, and exegetes of the Qur'an. Some of these hadiths found their way to some Shi'a sources of hadiths and exegesis of the Qur'an as well. According to Shi'as: Shiite scholars have objected to such hadiths with respect to both their contents and chains of transmissions. For example, they object that the chains of the transmitters of such hadiths do not continuously end in the person who allegedly witnessed the story. Moreover, doubting the authenticity of the revelation—whether he had met Jabra'il or Satan—is incompatible with the infallibility of the Prophet (s). Supporting the Prophet (s) During the Prophet's (s) mission, Jabra'il always helped him. Here are some cases in which the Prophet (s) was aided by Jabra'il: The Prophet's (s) chest was expanded and purified by Jabra'il and Mika'il. Jabra'il taught wudu' and prayer to the Prophet (s). He accompanied the Prophet (s) and guided him throughout his mi'raj (ascent to the heavens). However, he could not accompany the Prophet (s) in Sidart al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree, or the utmost boundary), where the Prophet (s) continued the journey on his own. When the Prophet (s) wanted to let his family know about his prophethood , Jabra'il encouraged him to do so. He let the Prophet (s) know about a conspiracy by polytheists to kill him before his migration . In the Battle of Badr , he and thousands of other angels joined and aided the Prophet (s) and his companions. Jabra'il always went to the Prophet (s) with humility. He always asked the Prophet (s) to give him permission before going to him. The place where Jabra'il appeared to the Prophet (s) in al-Masjid al-Nabawi is called \"Maqam Jabra'il\" (stance of Jabra'il). The Prophet (s) reviewed the Qur'an with Jabra'il once a year in Ramadan months. It is said that he went down to the Prophet (s) 60,000 times. Seeing Jabra'il According to hadiths, Jabra'il sometimes appeared to the Prophet (s) in his real face, sometimes as a handsome young man and sometimes as invisible. The Real Face According to Sunni and Shi'a sources, the Prophet (s) saw Jabra'il in his real face twice: Once in the \"Highest Horizon\" (al-Ufuq al-A'la) when the Prophet (a) asked him to show his real face. Once again in mi'raj near Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree). It is also said that on one occasion, the Prophet (s) saw Jabra'il sitting on al-Kursi (the Throne) between the sky and the Earth, and then the verses of Sura al-Muddaththir were revealed to him. About the real appearance of Jabra'il, it is said that he has 600 wings decorated with pearls, filling the east and the west of the cosmos. The Human Face The Prophet (s) said that Jabra'il usually appeared to him with the face of a handsome young man, called Dihya al-Kalbi . It is said that even some Sahaba and A'isha saw Jabra'il in this appearance and thought that he was Dihya al-Kalbi. According to some Sunni hadiths, Jabra'il once appeared to the Prophet's (s) companions in the form of a man in order to teach them the doctrines of Islam. He usually appeared as an ordinary man with green clothes and a silk turban, riding a horse or a mule. Helping the Imams (a) According to hadiths, Shi'a Imams (a) also enjoyed the support of Jabra'il. In his Bihar al-anwar , 'Allama Majlisi collected many hadiths in this regard in an independent chapter. It is said that Jabra'il taught the Laylat al-Sabt Supplication to Imam 'Ali (a) . After the demise of the Prophet (s), Jabra'il suggested some Knowledge of the Hidden to Fatima al-Zahra (a) which was collected by 'Ali (a) in a book known as Mushaf Fatima . Relations with Nabi, Rasul, and Imam In a series of hadiths, the difference between Rasul , Nabi , and Imam with respect to their relations with Jabra'il is pointed out. According to these hadiths, Rasul sees Jabra'il and talks to him; Nabi sees Jabra'il only in his dreams and hears his voice; and Imam only hears Jabra'il's voice. These hadiths are collected by al-Saffar al-Qummi. In the Stories of the Prophets Jabra'il distinctively figures in the stories of the prophets, since he was the teacher and supporter of all prophets from Adam (a) to Jesus . He taught farming, manipulation of the iron, and hajj rituals to Adam (a), building a ship to Noah (a) , and making armors to David (a) , he rescued Abraham (a) from Nimrod 's fire, he saved Ishmael (a) from being slaughtered, he helped Joseph (a) when he was thrown into a water well by his brothers, and he helped Moses (a) in his conflict with the army of Pharaoh by downing them in the Red Sea. Most of these stories are transmitted by unreliable transmitters such as Ka'b al-Ahbar and Wahb b. Munabbih . These stories are mentioned in detail in al-Tha'labi's Qisas al-anbiya' . Titles Jabra'il is characterized in hadiths with titles such as \"Tawus al-Mala'ika\" (the Peacock of Angels), and \"al-Namus al-Akbar\" (that is, the big holder of good news, as opposed to \"al-Jasus\" which means the holder of bad news). Jabra'il is one of the four nearest angels to God who administer the world: Jabra'il (or Gabriel) carries revelations, Mika'il (or Michael) is in charge of livelihoods and rains, Israfil blows in the Trumpet on Dooms Day, and 'Izra'il (or Azrael) is the angel of death. Superiority to Angels Some hadiths imply that the other three angels are superior to Jabra'il; for example, according to some hadiths, Mika'il and Israfil mediated the revelation (wahy), Mika'il is very big, and Jabra'il's life will be taken on Dooms Day by Izra'il. These stories might imply that these three angels are superior to Jabra'il. However, there are more explicit remarks in other hadiths to the effect that Jabra'il is superior to all other angels. In the Jewish-Christian Tradition The Hebrew word, Gaḇrīēl, which is pronounced in Greek as Gabriel, literally means \"God is almighty\" or \"man of God\" or \"hero of God\". Jabra'il is mentioned 4 times in the Bibles. Two times in the Book of Daniel: according to this book, Jabra'il appeared to the prophet, Daniel (a) , in the form of a human being, to tell him the interpretation of his dream. The appearance of Jabra'il is accompanied by a rapture with which Daniel (a) was enchanted and fell unconscious. In another part of the Book of Daniel, Jabra'il flies to Daniel (a) when he was praying and slaughtering for the sake of God to reveal some secrets to him. In these cases, Jabra'il is not referred to as an angel; rather as a heavenly being who carries God's message and whose appearance is accompanied by a divine rapture Twice in the Gospel of Luke: here he is referred to as the angel who gives the prophet Zechariah (a) (or Zakariyya) the good news that he would have a son, John the Baptist (or Yahya (a) ). He also gave Mary (or Maryam (a)) the good news that she would have a son, Jesus. It is said that Jabra'il figures in the Old Testament merely as manifesting the divine might, but he figures in the New Testament as an assuring character as well. It is also said that the 4 times in which Jabra'il figures in the Bible are somewhat relevant to the divine promise of Jesus being born. Unofficial Books Jabra'il prominently figures in unofficial books between Torah and Gospel and was elevated to one of the nearest angels to God. In the Aramaic translation and interpretation of the Torah, Jabra'il has more roles to play. Contributions to some events are attributed to him, which occurred in the early periods of the Old Testament; for example, they allege that he guided the prophet, Joseph (a), or attended the burial of the Prophet, Moses (a). Additionallyو in some Jewish writings, Jabra'il, who is conceived to be made of fire, is, along with Michael, Uriel and Raphael, one of the four angels who reside around the Throne (al-'Arsh). Moreover, he is taken to be one of the angels who met the prophet, Abraham (a) and destroyed Sodom (a city in which the People of Lot lived). Ranking among the Angels Although Jabra'il became increasingly more valuable and higher-ranking in both the Jewish and Christian traditions and his image as a winged angel found its way to paintings, he was never deemed as valuable as Mika'il neither in the Jewish tradition (in which Mika'il is taken to be the permanent defender of the Jewish people), nor in the Christian tradition. He was always second to Mika'il in these traditions. In Islamic Philosophy In the texts of Islamic philosophy and mysticism, Jabra'il is associated with notions such as intellect and spirit. Ibn Sina takes the \"intellects\" (al-'uqul) to be the nearest angels to God, and in his explanation of revelation (wahy), he maintains that the Prophet Muhammad (s) was connected to the Active Intellect through which he received his revelations. Ibn Sina calls the angel who revealed the wahy \" Ruh al-Qudus \" (the Holy Spirit), taking him to the noblest spirit and a holy soul or a medium between God (the Necessary Being) and the First Intellect . Shahab al-Din al-Suhrawardi takes Jabra'il to be the Tenth Intellect and the last word in the Arc of Descent and among divine words. In the terminologies of the Illuminationist Philosophy , Jabra'il is one of the al-Anwar al-qahira (Victorious Lights)—it is the biggest of these lights which holds the spell of the human archetype. Al-Suhrawardi takes the genesis of the Elemental and Sensuous World as well as human souls to be caused by the acts of Jabra'il. He also attributes to him the acts of giving life, giving knowledge, and giving virtues. According to al-Suhrawardi, Jabra'il or Ruh al-Qudus (the Holy Spirit) brings human souls from potentiality to actuality. If human beings have the required disposition, they can connect to him and enjoy his treasury of knowledge and virtues. On this view, the relation between Jabra'il and human souls is that of the sun with the eyes or the pen with a paper. Thus, Jabra'il is the medium of the existence and knowledge of human souls. Mulla Sadra identifies Jabra'il with the Holy Spirit and the Active Intellect. On his view, Jabra'il is the angel of guidance. He has a prominent role in the perfection of souls. He is the medium by which knowledge is given to souls and wahy is revealed to prophets . According to Mulla Sadra, in giving knowledge to human beings, Jabra'il treats everyone in an equal way, although the degree to which knowledge is acquired varies with the difference in human dispositions and capacities which prepare the ground for the connection with Jabra'il or the Active Intellect. In Mulla Sadra's view, Jabra'il has two positions with respect to which he is referred to with different titles: so long as he did not descend from the heaven of immateriality and proximity to God, he is called the \"Holy Spirit\" (Ruh al-Qudus), and when he descends from there and embodies in a mundane form, he is called the Spirit (al-Ruh). Abu Ya'qub al-Sajistani , an Isma'ili scholar, has coined three terms, \"Jadd\" (ancestor), \"Fath\" (opening), and \"Khiyal\" (imagination), and applied them respectively to Jabra'il, Mika'il, and Israfil. \"Jadd\" is the determining factor in the happiness and misery of human beings. If \"Jadd\" supports a pure soul, they will turn into teachers of their times, guiding people to divine satisfaction. Lights of the divine kingdom reach the person through the \"Jadd\". Whenever the lights—the messages—are vague and indistinct, \"Fath\" (Mika'il) will open—that is, decipher—them. In Islamic Mysticism In Islamic mystical texts, Jabra'il is referred to as the origin of life, the manifestation of divine knowledge, the embodied form of intellect, the assignee of knowledge-acquisition and the management of livelihoods, and the teacher of prophets. He is one of the 4 angels who carry the Divine Throne (al-'Arsh) before the resurrection , and one of the 8 angels who do so at the time of the resurrection. According to al-Fanari, Jabra'il's stance is in Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree) which is an intermediate world between the natural elemental world and the world of constant universal nature containing the Imaginal World ('alam al-mithal), the Throne (al-'Arsh), al-Kursi , and the like. Thus, the form of Jabra'il as appearing in this stance includes the characteristics of what is above and beneath the Lote (Sidra). Jabra'il is the holder of divine words. Sayyid Haydar al-Amuli identifies Jabra'il with the First Intellect in some respect, but according to al-Jayli, God created Jabra'il in the eternity from the First Intellect, which is identical to the spirituality of the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Thus, the Prophet (s) is the father of Jabra'il and the origin of the whole world. This is why in the night of mi'raj , Jabra'il—who is inferior in his ranking to the Prophet (s)—could continue the holy journey along with the Prophet (s) and stay at the stance of the Utmost Lote Tree. He believes that the Muhammadi Reality (al-Haqiqat al-Muhammadiyya) or \"Ruh\" (the Spirit) is the noblest angel and the highest-ranking creature, of which many angels—including Jabra'il—are a form and from which they are created. \"Ruh al-Qudus\" (the Holy Spirit) and \"Ruh al-Amin\" (the Trusted Spirit) are not, according to al-Jayli, specific titles of Jabra'il. In his view, Jabra'il is called \"Rul al-Amin\" because his origin (the First Intellect, that is, the Prophet Muhammad (s)) is Ruh al-Amin. In the terminology of Sufis, Jabra'il is also referred to as \"Ruh al-Ilqa'\" (the Spirit of Suggestion, because it suggests the Knowledge of the Hidden to the hearts). Identification of Simurgh with Jabra'il In the Islamic mystical literature, some people have proposed the possibility of applying the characteristics of Simurgh to Jabra'il. Simurgh is a mythical, sacred, and supernatural bird. This has been compared with Jabra'il's characterization as having large wings and feathers and a huge body. Simurgh's support of Zal in ancient texts of the Persian literature, and his mediation for the transfer of hidden forces to Zal are similar to the relation between Jabra'il and the Prophet Muhammad (s). The tree or a mountain in which Simurgh resides has immaterial features. The tree, called \"Tuba\", comes out of mountains and is the mother of all plants and vegetables. Every morning when Simurgh flies out of its nest and spreads its wings over the Earth, all the fruits appearing on trees and all vegetables growing on the Earth result from its feathers. Correspondingly, Jabra'il is said to reside in Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree) which is a monumental tree, to which the acts of the creatures and the positions of the prophets and angels go back. Simurgh is the king of all birds, and what appears in Ibn Sina 's Risala al-tayr and Ahmad al-Ghazali 's story of birds regarding the journey of the birds to Simurgh by traveling different stations and stages is very similar to the stages of the development of the soul to reach the stage of Acquired Intellect (al-'Aql al-Mustafad) and the connection with the Active Intellect (which is Jabra'il). Simurgh's Support of Mystics Mulla Sadra quoted mystics as saying that in order for creatures to achieve all the various perfections that they can achieve and in order for mystical wayfarers to reach their desires and destinations, they should be helped by this sacred bird. Mystical Characteristics of Jabra'il In his Persian essay, Awaz-i par-i Jabra'il (The sound of Jabra'il's feather), inspired by what appears in the Qur'an concerning the features of the angels' wings and in hadiths concerning the wings of Jabra'il, al-Suhrawardi maintains that Jabra'il, because of having two wings, is superior to angels who have 3 or 4 wings, because 2 is closer than all other numbers to 1. He has also referred to the right wings of Jabra'il being bright and his left wings being dark. Light or brightness is, for al-Suhrawardi, a symbol of existence, and darkness is a symbol of non-existence, and except \"Nur al-Anwar\" (the light of the lights) who is a mere light and the essentially Necessary Being, every other being is contingently existent, and this is the reason why Jabra'il's left-wing is dark. The souls are created from Jabra'il's right-wing which is bright, and the material world is created from his left-wing which is dark. Moreover, the suggestion of knowledge to prophets and saints of God is attributed to his right-wing, but catastrophes, cries, and accidents are attributed to his left-wing. Moreover, according to Mulla Sadra's account, mystics hold that the sacred bird, Simurgh, residing the mythical mountain, Cafcuh (or Qaf), has a cry that awakens the asleep in darkness and reminds ignorant people of divine signs. However, there are few people who listen to his cry and know his song. If one understands his language, he will understand the language of all the birds. In Persian poems, \"Shahpar\" (the king feather) or \"Par-i Jabra'il\" (Jabra'il's feather) is also frequently used. It is alleged to have features such as protection against enemies, preventing the damages of fire and water, and recovering wounds. Jabra'il is also known as \"Tawus al-Mala'ika\" (the Peacock of Angels), \"Our Father\", and the \"Logos\" (the Universal Intellect).

{"title": "Harut and Marut", "text": "Hārūt and Mārūt (Arabic: هاروت و ماروت ) were two angels who taught magics to people after the death of the Prophet Solomon (a) in order for people to be able to neutralize the magics of evil magicians. But people misused what they learned from the angels. The story is mentioned in the Qur'an 2 , verse 102. Harut and Marut Harut and Marut were two angels sent by God to Babylon : \"and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut\". There is a disagreement over the origin of the terms, \"Harut\" and \"Marut\": Some people believe that the terms come from the Aramaic language. [2] Others take them to be of a Syriac origin, which means monarchical. [3] A number of other people take the terms to be of a Persian origin. [4] There are many tales and stories about Harut and Marut, many of which are taken by scholars and exegetes of the Qur'an to be fake. For example, the story that a woman called \"Zuhra\" deceived Harut and Marut and learned God's Greatest Name and then turned into a star and went to the sky is considered as fake. Teaching Magics According to hadiths , a group of people practiced magics and witchcraft in the period of Solomon (a) . He ordered that all their writings be gathered and kept in a place. After Solomon's (a) death, some of them found the writings and began to learn magics. They said that Solomon (a) was not a prophet and that he just took over the territories and did extraordinary things by magics. They were followed by a number of Israelites . The practice of magics prevailed in Babylon in such a way that people were frustrated and hurt. God sent two angels to them in the form of human persons in order to teach people the magics and the ways of neutralizing them so that they can get rid of the devils of magicians. The Qur'an rejects the claim that Harut and Marut did evil things. It says that the magics was revealed to them, but they intended no harms. They reminded people that \"we are a trial, so do not disbelieve and do not misuse the knowledge\", but people misused the knowledge and disbelieved God. There is a great deal of disagreement over the story of Harut and Marut. In addition to the above account, the following accounts are also offered: Some people believe that Harut and Marut were two angels who blamed human beings because of their sins . God sent them down to the earth in the form of human beings, but they committed sins themselves and were finally punished by God. [13] Hasan al-Basri believed that Harut and Marut were not angels; rather they were two sturdy men from Babylon. [14] They were spirits of the nature at first, and then they turned into angels. They were worshiped by ancient Armenians as two gods. [15] Harut and Marut in non-Islamic Books Armenian Sources and Avesta According to historians, the words, \"Harut\" and \"Marut\", appear in Armenian books, historical books of Egypt , and Slavonic texts of Enoch and the like with remarkable differences. A British historian reported an Armenian source as saying that \"Hurut\" means fertile and \"Murut\" means immortal, referring to two gods of the Mount Masis or Ararat. In an Egyptian myth that he translated, Watts Neld encountered the names, \"Hurvanati\" and \"Amerekati\" which are similar to \"Harut\" and \"Marut\". Accounts in Jewish Sources In his al-Mizan , 'Allama Tabataba'i writes that the story of Harut and Marut corresponds to myths maintained by the Jews about the two angels, and it is not dissimilar to ancient Greek myths about stars. The myth appears in the Second Epistle of Peter: \"For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept until the judgment.\" Also, in verse 6 of the Epistle of Jude we read: \"And the angels who did not keep their own position, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day\".

{"title": "Izra'il", "text": "Azrael or ʿIzrā'īl (Arabic: عِزرائیل ) is the Angel of Death, an angel close to God who is assigned by Him to take the lives of living beings. Azrael takes the lives of prophets (a) and saints on his own, and he has agents who take the lives of other beings. When Azrael takes the lives of all living beings, God will take his own life. Name and Features \"Azrael\" has a Hebrew origin, consisting of two parts (\"Azra\" and \"el\") where the first part means servant and the second means God, and so the phrase literally means \"the servant of God\". The word found its way to Arabic (by transforming into \"'Izra'il\") through the Syriac language. Azrael is referred to in the Qur'an as \"Malak al-Mawt\" (the Angel of Death): \"Say: \"The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will take your souls: then shall ye be brought back to your Lord\"\". He is also referred to in hadiths as \"Qābiḍ al-Arwāḥ\" ( قابض الأرواح , literally: taker of the souls) and \"Hādim al-Dhāt\" ( هادِم الذات , literally: destroyer of the essence). According to hadiths , Azrael is a manifestation of divine attributes, \"al-Qābiḍ\" ( القابض ) and \"al-Mumīt\" ( المُمیت ), because it is God who expands people's souls or grasps them, although He does this with His agents, such as angels and Azrael. Azrael, Mika'il , Israfil , and Jabra'il are characterized as \"Heads of Angels\" (Ru'us al-Mala'ika). According to some hadiths, the preserved tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) consists of four elements: knowledge, life, will, and power, and Azrael is a manifestation of its power. According to some hadiths, in the last moments of the Prophet Muhammad's (s) life, Fatima (a) and Azrael, who was permitted to enter the Prophet's (s) house, had a conversation. Also, some physical properties are attributed to Azrael in some sources of hadiths, such as having four wings which cover the four sides of the whole world with his feet in the bottom of the world and his head in the sky. However, according to Shiite theologians , the wings of angels are not analogous to those of birds, since they are immaterial entities. Their attributes are cashed out in hadiths in ways that are understandable by laypeople. Tasks According to some hadiths, when God wanted to create Adam , He ordered the angels to bring Him part of the soil on the Earth, but none of them could do this except Azrael, because he was the only angel who enjoyed the divine power and dominance. Thus, God appointed him to take the lives of living beings. Azrael takes the lives of prophets and saints on his own, but the lives of other living beings are taken by his agents. There is a question of how Azrael can take the lives of many living beings throughout the world at the same time. To this question, philosophers and theologians have answered as follows: Azrael is an immaterial, spiritual entity, and so he is not located in a particular place and so, he does not move from one place to another. In fact, the whole material world is the same for Azrael. So, he takes the lives of many living beings at the same time by calling them to himself. There are many verses of the Qur'an with regard to how the soul is taken or grasped: in some Quranic verses, the grasping of the souls is attributed to God; in others, it is attributed to Azrael, and in others, it is attributed to other angels. According to exegetes of the Qur'an, these verses do not contradict one another, because God is the ultimate cause of taking lives, but the task is sometimes carried out by Azrael and sometimes by other angels. Assistants The Quranic verse, \"when death comes to one of you, Our angels take his soul\", shows that people's deaths are undertaken by a group of angels, and so, Azrael has many assistants and agents to take the lives of people. The angels are referred to in the Qur'an as \"Nāzi'āt\" ( نازعات , pluckers), \"Sābiḥāt\" ( سابحات , swimmers), and \"Sābiqāt\" ( سابقات , outsrippers) who are assigned with different tasks of taking the lives. For example, \"Nāshiṭāt\" ( ناشطات , drawers) are commissioned to take the lives of believers gently, and \"Nazi'at\" are commissioned to take the lives of unbelievers forcefully. According to Quranic verses, unbelievers die with a lot of pain and torture. Angels of death surround them and beat them behind them and in front of them, but the lives of believers are taken by the angels of mercy. They are treated gently and are given the good news of going to the Heaven . Death of Azrael When Israfil blows the Trumpet (see: Nafkh al-Sur ) for the first time at the end of the world, all living beings will die, except Azrael and some other angels. After the first blow of the Trumpet, when Azrael takes the lives of other angels who were initially excluded from death, God will take the life of Azrael.

{"title": "Israfil", "text": "Isrāfīl (Arabic: إسْرافیل ) is an angel commissioned to blow the Trumpet (see: Nafkh al-Sur ) when this world comes to an end and the resurrection begins. According to hadiths , this angel is one of the close angels to God and his tasks include blowing the Trumpet , delivering divine messages to other angels, and receiving the daily records of people from angels appointed to record people's actions. He also carried out significant missions, such as waking up Seven Sleepers (Ashab al-Kahf) from many years of sleep, helping the Prophet Muhammad (s) in the Battle of Badr , and accompanying the Prophet (s) in Mi'raj . Features and Characteristics Israfil is one of the close angels to God known mainly for blowing the Trumpet to announce the end of this world. In hadiths, his name is said to be \"'Abd al-Rahman\" and his kunya is \"Abu l-Manafikh\". The word, \"Israfil\", does not appear in the Qur'an , but there are verses concerning blowing the Trumpet which is, according to hadiths, undertaken by Israfil. According to hadiths, this angel is the manifestation of the divine attribute , al-Rahman , and the manifestation of the tenet of \"life\" in the Preserved Slate (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). He was the first to mention \"subhan rabbi al-a'la wa bi-hamdih\" (exalted is my Lord the Highest and I praise Him). According to hadiths, Israfil has 12 wings one of which is located in the east of the world and the other is located in the west, and 'Arsh (the Throne) is located on his shoulder, but in comparison to the greatness of God, he is smaller than a sparrow. He sees himself to be so little in comparison to God that he hides himself under one of his wings out of shame. According to Shiite theologians and philosophers , angels are immaterial beings, and so their wings are not like those of material birds. Tasks According to hadiths, an important task of Israfil is to blow the Trumpet . Israfil has an army of angels at his disposal, and when the time of the resurrection approaches, God orders them to prepare the grounds for the resurrection. After that, Israfil blows the Trumpet after which everything in this world dies and the world comes to an end. He then blows the Trumpet again after which everything comes back to life and the resurrection begins. Some scholars take Israfil to be one of the angels who carry God's Throne . He is also taken to be commissioned to deliver God's messages to other angels. For example, when God wants to reveal something to a prophet , He shows the Preserved Slate to Israfil who then reveals what he saw to Jabra'il . According to another hadith, when Nimrud threw the prophet Abraham (a) into the fire, Israfil was the first angel who went to help him at the command of God. Other tasks have also been attributed to Israfil in hadiths, including: Lifting the divine punishment from the people of the prophet Jonah (a) , Destroying the people of the prophet Lot (a) , Waking up the Seven Sleepers after years of sleep, Accompanying the Prophet Muhammad (s) for three years before Bi'that , Helping the Prophet (s) in the Battle of Badr , Accompanying the Prophet (s) in his Mi'raj , Saying funeral prayer on the Prophet's (s) corpse, Giving Abraham (a) the good news of the birth of his son Isaac (a) , Reciting the adhan in the skies, Receiving the records of people's actions from angels who are assigned with the task of recording the actions, Helping the Muslim armies at the End Time (or Akhir al-Zaman ). Virtues There are four great and close angels before God: Israfil, Jabra'il , Mika'il , and 'Izra'il who are known as the \"Heads of Angels\". According to hadiths, God has created Israfil, Jabra'il and Mika'il from one tasbih , and Israfil and Jabra'il are said to be the closest creatures to God, because there are only four veils between them and God, while there are 70,000 veils between God and other creatures. According to a hadith, the Prophet (s) always addressed God in his midnight supplications as follows: \"O Allah, the Lord of Jabra'il and Mika'il and Israfil\", and Imam al-Sajjad (a) prayed for Israfil as follows: \"O Allah! Send regards to Israfil who is the owner of the Trumpet and is waiting for your command to blow the Trumpet and wake up the sleepers of the graves\". Israfil in Religions and Cultures In the Torah , there are angels known as \"Seraphs\" who are sitting on the Throne and recite the dhikr : \"holy, holy, holy\". Although there are hadiths in Islamic sources concerning Israfil's exaltation of God and his carrying the Throne, it refers to a single angel, but \"Seraphs\" in Judaism refers to a group of angels. Blowing the Trumpet by Israfil is not dissimilar to Shiva in Hinduism who makes people die or come back to life by banging a drum. People of ancient Egypt also believed that people of the Heaven enjoy the hearing of the songs of Israfil. Also, a scholar of the ancient Levant talked about a singing angel called \"Israfil\" who exalts God and as a result, residents of the sky quit their worships and listen to his exaltation.

{"title": "Michael", "text": "Michael or Mīkāʾīl (Arabic: میکائیل ) is an archangel assigned with the important responsibility of providing sustenance and livelihood to humanity. He is mentioned in the Qur'an . According to hadiths, Michael is an angel of mercy, a carrier of the Divine Throne , and one of the first angels who prostrated before Adam (a) . Other duties attributed to him include \"expanding the chest\" of the Prophet (s) , protecting him during Laylat al-Mabit , aiding Muslims in the Battle of Badr , and facilitating the Prophet's (s) journey on Buraq during the Night of Ascension (Mi'raj). Additionally, the Bible refers to him as the leader of all angels. His Place Michael, or Mika'il, is an archangel close to God. In the Qur'an , he is referred to as Mikal. Many Sunni exegetes of the Qur'an as well as some Shi'a exegetes cite hadiths to show that he is the angel of mercy. Furthermore, according to some hadiths, the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) has four tenets, one of which (the tenet of will) is epitomized by Michael. In addition, Michael is the manifestation of God’s name “Lord” (Rabb), and a carrier of the Divine Throne. Michael, Gabriel , Israfil , and Azrael are considered as the four archangels who hold a special position close to God. They are described as “leading angels” or “archangels.” In hadiths, Michael is deemed the second closest angel to God, after Gabriel. The Qur'an says about him that “Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.” As per some hadiths, Michael, Gabriel, and Israfil were created from a single exaltation of God. During his midnight prayers, the Prophet (s) addressed God as \"O Lord of Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil.\" Imam 'Ali (a) has stated in a hadith that Michael is the imam or leader of all angels. In the \" frequented house \" (al-Bayt al-Ma'mur), all angels pray behind Michael. Imam al-Sajjad (a) prays for Michael as follows: \"O God, bestow peace and greetings upon Michael, who holds a standing position with You and a place of great obedience. Duties According to Shiite hadiths, God provides sustenance and livelihood to all of His creatures through the angel Michael. Moreover, on the day of resurrection , he is said to be responsible for setting up the Sirat Bridge over the Hell . There are also some hadiths that describe him as the angel in charge of bringing rain and having performed other duties, including: Participation in vanquishing the Pharaoh ’s people Participation in vanquishing the Lot ’s people Giving the good tidings of Prophet Isaac ’s birth to Prophet Abraham (a) Receiving the news from Israfil and delivering it to Gabriel Protecting the Prophet (s) on the Laylat al-Mabit Aiding the Muslims during the Battle of Badr Bringing Buraq for the Prophet (s) on the Night of Ascension Performing a prayer for the Prophet's (s) corpse [16] According to some hadiths, Michael and Gabriel were among the first angels who prostrated for Adam (a). Moreover, they “expanded the breast” (sharh al-sadr) of the Prophet (s). In Other Religions In Jewish and Christian sources, Michael is described as an archangel holding a special position close to God. He is also called Michel. For Jews, Michael counts as a constant supporter of the Jewish people, holding a rank higher than even Gabriel. Moreover, the Bible ( Book of Daniel 10, 12) characterizes Michael as the leader of all angels who aids Daniel to defeat his enemies. The Epistle of Jude describes Michael as the leader of the angels who engages in a conflict with Satan over the body of Prophet Moses (a) , warning him that Yahweh would reproach him. In the Book of Revelation by John, Michael is mentioned along with an army of angels who fight against a dragon. Notes References"}
{"title": "Ruh al-qudus", "text": "Rūḥ al-qudus (Arabc: رُوح‌ُ القُدُس ) or the Holy Spirit , is a being whose nature has been a matter of disagreement among Muslim scholars. Some maintain that it is another name for Gabriel , others take consider is a being from the World of Command, a hidden force, the Active Intellect, the Spirit of the Spirits, or the greatest angel. In Islamic sources, such tasks as conveying revelation to prophets, helping believers , being the source of the knowledge of prophets , being the source from which the Imams (a) receive their knowledge, and intercession on the Day of Judgment have been attributed to the Holy Spirit. In Christianity , the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity and is considered divine by mainstream Christians. The Nature of the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit is the spirit that is free from defects and imperfections. This word is mentioned in the Quran and the Bible. The Quran mentions that the Quran was sent down by the Holy Spirit 3 and that Jesus was supported by it. Muslim scholars disagree as to the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit. Gabriel: Some Quranic commentators consider the Holy Spirit to be Gabriel. [4] Calling Gabriel the Holy Spirit indicates his holiness as well as his role in preserving religion . [5] A being from the World of Command: Allama Tabatabai maintains that the Holy Spirit is not an angel but a being from the World of Command , who would convey revelation to prophets. [6] The greatest angel: According to a hadith attributed to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Holy Spirit is an angel greater than Gabriel and Michael , who accompanied Prophet Muhammad (s) and then the Imams (a). [7] According to other hadiths, the Holy Spirit is the spirit, [8] which, according to the Quran, comes down together with Angels on the Night of Ordainment . [9] A Hidden Force: According to a view, the Holy Spirit is a hidden force [10] with which Jesus (a) revived the dead. A weaker degree of this force exists in other believers as well and helps them in the path of God. [11] The first being: According to Sayyid Haydar Amuli , the Holy Spirit is a name for the first created being. [12] The Spirit of the Spirits: In some mystical works, the Holy Spirit is said to be the Spirit of the Spirits, which is not a created being but rather a face among the faces of God, upon which the essence of created beings depends. [13] Tasks The Quran and hadiths mention a number of tasks for the Holy Spirit. Conveying the revelation to prophets: According to the view that the Holy Spirit is Gabriel, bringing revelation and conveying divine messages were among its tasks. Supporting prophets and the Friends of God: According to a number of Quranic verses the Holy Spirit supported Jesus (a). [14] The source of prophets’ knowledge: According to some hadiths , prophets and Imams have five spirits, and the Holy Spirit is one of them. This spirit is that by which prophets and Imams gain their knowledge. [15] Conveying divine verdict: According to hadiths, the Holy Spirit conveys divine verdicts to the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . [16] Intercession: Based on a hadith from the Prophet (s), the first interceder on the Day of Judgment is the Holy Spirit. [17] Supporting believers: It is stated in some hadiths that the Holy Spirit supports believers as long as they support the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). [18] Ibn Athir reports that the Prophet (s) asked God to support Hassan b. Thabit , a poet who composed poems in defense of the Prophet (s), with the Holy Spirit as long as he supported the Prophet (s). [19] Notes References"}
{"title": "Gabriel", "text": "Gabriel (Arabic: جبرائيل , jabrāʾīl or جِبرِیل , Jibrīl) is one of the four nearest angels to God . Jabra'il carries divine revelations . In addition to carrying the revelation, Jabra'il allegedly helps the prophets , punishes the unbelievers, and consoles the believers. The word \"Jabra'il\" is used in 3 Quranic verses and many hadiths . The significance of Jabra'il is discussed in Islamic philosophy and mysticism . In Islamic philosophy, Jabra'il is identified with the \"Active Intellect\". The angel is also mentioned in Jewish and Christian texts. Literal Meaning The word \"Jabra'il\" has a Hebrew origin. It seems that its Syriac form has entered Arabic. Researchers of the Arabic language have made it explicit that the word is not Arabic. Some Arabic lexicographers have referred to different meanings of \"Jabr\", including a king, servant, brave, and man, and the meaning of \"il\" which refers to God in Hebrew, thus taking \"Jabra'il\" to have two parts, just like \" Mika'il \" and \" Israfil : Jabr + il, which means the man of God or God's servant. In the Qur'an Say, \"Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel [should know that] it is he who has brought it down on your heart with the will of Allah, confirming what has been [revealed] before it, and as a guidance and good news to the faithful.\" Qur'an 2:97 The word \"Jibril\" appears in three verses of the Qur'an , all of which were revealed in Medina . In the Qur'an 2 :97 , it is explicitly mentioned that Jara'il's main task is to carry the divine revelation. However, it is silent on how he carries the revelation. There are other phrases in the Qur'an that its exegetes take to refer to Jabra'il, including: \"Al-Ruh al-amin\" ( الروح الأمين , the Trusted Spirit) , which refers to his trustworthiness in carrying the revelation to prophets. \"Rasul karim\" ( رسول کريم , Dignified Messenger) , which refers to his good characteristics. \"Shadid al-Quwa\" ( شديد القُوَی , Mighty in Power) , \"Dhu Mirra\" ( ذو مِرَّة , possessor of strength) , and \"Dhi Quwwa\" ( ذی قُوَّة , possessor of power), referring to his power to perform divine commands. \"Makin\" ( مَکين , firmly established) and \"Muta'\" ( مُطاع , obeyed) , referring to his special place for God and among other angels. \"Ruh al-Qudus\" ( رُوح القُدُس , the Holy Spirit) . Birth of Jesus According to Quranic verses, Jabra'il had a special role in the birth of the prophet Jesus . He gave the good news of the birth of Jesus to Maryam (a) (Saint Mary) by appearing to her in the form of a man, blowing the divine spirit in her. God empowered and aided Jesus with Jabra'il. Exegetes of the Qur'an agree that Jabra'il contributed to the birth of Jesus by blowing the divine \"spirit\" to Maryam (a). Spirit There is a disagreement about the relation between Jabra'il and the Spirit (Ruh) and what is meant by the Spirit as mentioned in Sura al-Qadr or as asked about in the Qur'an. Some people take the Spirit as an angel in charge of the souls or a creature superior to angels, including Jabra'il, and some people identify the Spirit with Jabra'il, taking the word \"Ruh\" (Spirit) to refer to his superiority to other angels. Criticism of the Jewish Conception According to the Qur'an 2:97-98, the Jews asked the Prophet Muhammad (s) about the angel who descends to him and carries the revelation to him. When they heard that the angel was Jabra'il, they said that the angel was their enemy. It seems that they took Jabra'il to be the angel who brings hardships, punishments, and wars, in contrast to Mika'il who was the angel of mercy and good news for the Jews. Thus, Sura al-Baqara (chapter 2):98 takes the hostility with Jabra'il to amount to enmity with Mika'il, other angels, and even God. The Myth of his betrayal (Khan al-Amin) Some Sunni scholars have falsely attributed to Shi'as the belief that Jabra'il was supposed to carry the revelation to 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , but he disobeyed God's orders and carried the revelation to Muhammad (s) . Thus, the accusation against Shi'as continues, they—the Shi'as—raise their arms after saying their prayers and say: \"Khan al-Amin\" ( خانَ الاَمینُ ), that is, the trusted (Jabra'il) has broken his promise. Ibn Taymiyya , a Wahhabi scholar, makes such an accusation against Shi'as. However, Shi'as never believed so. Some Shi'a scholars have responded to such an accusation. The Revelation According to available reports, Jabra'il revealed the first Quranic verses to the Prophet (s) in the Hira' Cave . Then, the Prophet (s) went to his wife, Khadija (a) , and let her know about the revelation made to him. The rest of the story is, nonetheless, a matter of dispute among Shi'as and Sunnis. According to Sunni Muslims: according to several hadiths in Sunni sources, the Prophet (s) doubted whether who he met was the angel of revelation or the Satan . His wife recommended that he go to Waraqa b. Nawfal , a Nazarite who was familiar with religious books. He assured the Prophet (s) that who he saw was the angel who carried the revelation to the prophet Moses (a) . The story is widely accepted by Sunni biographers, scholars of hadiths, and exegetes of the Qur'an. Some of these hadiths found their way to some Shi'a sources of hadiths and exegesis of the Qur'an as well. According to Shi'as: Shiite scholars have objected to such hadiths with respect to both their contents and chains of transmissions. For example, they object that the chains of the transmitters of such hadiths do not continuously end in the person who allegedly witnessed the story. Moreover, doubting the authenticity of the revelation—whether he had met Jabra'il or Satan—is incompatible with the infallibility of the Prophet (s). Supporting the Prophet (s) During the Prophet's (s) mission, Jabra'il always helped him. Here are some cases in which the Prophet (s) was aided by Jabra'il: The Prophet's (s) chest was expanded and purified by Jabra'il and Mika'il. Jabra'il taught wudu' and prayer to the Prophet (s). He accompanied the Prophet (s) and guided him throughout his mi'raj (ascent to the heavens). However, he could not accompany the Prophet (s) in Sidart al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree, or the utmost boundary), where the Prophet (s) continued the journey on his own. When the Prophet (s) wanted to let his family know about his prophethood , Jabra'il encouraged him to do so. He let the Prophet (s) know about a conspiracy by polytheists to kill him before his migration . In the Battle of Badr , he and thousands of other angels joined and aided the Prophet (s) and his companions. Jabra'il always went to the Prophet (s) with humility. He always asked the Prophet (s) to give him permission before going to him. The place where Jabra'il appeared to the Prophet (s) in al-Masjid al-Nabawi is called \"Maqam Jabra'il\" (stance of Jabra'il). The Prophet (s) reviewed the Qur'an with Jabra'il once a year in Ramadan months. It is said that he went down to the Prophet (s) 60,000 times. Seeing Jabra'il According to hadiths, Jabra'il sometimes appeared to the Prophet (s) in his real face, sometimes as a handsome young man and sometimes as invisible. The Real Face According to Sunni and Shi'a sources, the Prophet (s) saw Jabra'il in his real face twice: Once in the \"Highest Horizon\" (al-Ufuq al-A'la) when the Prophet (a) asked him to show his real face. Once again in mi'raj near Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree). It is also said that on one occasion, the Prophet (s) saw Jabra'il sitting on al-Kursi (the Throne) between the sky and the Earth, and then the verses of Sura al-Muddaththir were revealed to him. About the real appearance of Jabra'il, it is said that he has 600 wings decorated with pearls, filling the east and the west of the cosmos. The Human Face The Prophet (s) said that Jabra'il usually appeared to him with the face of a handsome young man, called Dihya al-Kalbi . It is said that even some Sahaba and A'isha saw Jabra'il in this appearance and thought that he was Dihya al-Kalbi. According to some Sunni hadiths, Jabra'il once appeared to the Prophet's (s) companions in the form of a man in order to teach them the doctrines of Islam. He usually appeared as an ordinary man with green clothes and a silk turban, riding a horse or a mule. Helping the Imams (a) According to hadiths, Shi'a Imams (a) also enjoyed the support of Jabra'il. In his Bihar al-anwar , 'Allama Majlisi collected many hadiths in this regard in an independent chapter. It is said that Jabra'il taught the Laylat al-Sabt Supplication to Imam 'Ali (a) . After the demise of the Prophet (s), Jabra'il suggested some Knowledge of the Hidden to Fatima al-Zahra (a) which was collected by 'Ali (a) in a book known as Mushaf Fatima . Relations with Nabi, Rasul, and Imam In a series of hadiths, the difference between Rasul , Nabi , and Imam with respect to their relations with Jabra'il is pointed out. According to these hadiths, Rasul sees Jabra'il and talks to him; Nabi sees Jabra'il only in his dreams and hears his voice; and Imam only hears Jabra'il's voice. These hadiths are collected by al-Saffar al-Qummi. In the Stories of the Prophets Jabra'il distinctively figures in the stories of the prophets, since he was the teacher and supporter of all prophets from Adam (a) to Jesus . He taught farming, manipulation of the iron, and hajj rituals to Adam (a), building a ship to Noah (a) , and making armors to David (a) , he rescued Abraham (a) from Nimrod 's fire, he saved Ishmael (a) from being slaughtered, he helped Joseph (a) when he was thrown into a water well by his brothers, and he helped Moses (a) in his conflict with the army of Pharaoh by downing them in the Red Sea. Most of these stories are transmitted by unreliable transmitters such as Ka'b al-Ahbar and Wahb b. Munabbih . These stories are mentioned in detail in al-Tha'labi's Qisas al-anbiya' . Titles Jabra'il is characterized in hadiths with titles such as \"Tawus al-Mala'ika\" (the Peacock of Angels), and \"al-Namus al-Akbar\" (that is, the big holder of good news, as opposed to \"al-Jasus\" which means the holder of bad news). Jabra'il is one of the four nearest angels to God who administer the world: Jabra'il (or Gabriel) carries revelations, Mika'il (or Michael) is in charge of livelihoods and rains, Israfil blows in the Trumpet on Dooms Day, and 'Izra'il (or Azrael) is the angel of death. Superiority to Angels Some hadiths imply that the other three angels are superior to Jabra'il; for example, according to some hadiths, Mika'il and Israfil mediated the revelation (wahy), Mika'il is very big, and Jabra'il's life will be taken on Dooms Day by Izra'il. These stories might imply that these three angels are superior to Jabra'il. However, there are more explicit remarks in other hadiths to the effect that Jabra'il is superior to all other angels. In the Jewish-Christian Tradition The Hebrew word, Gaḇrīēl, which is pronounced in Greek as Gabriel, literally means \"God is almighty\" or \"man of God\" or \"hero of God\". Jabra'il is mentioned 4 times in the Bibles. Two times in the Book of Daniel: according to this book, Jabra'il appeared to the prophet, Daniel (a) , in the form of a human being, to tell him the interpretation of his dream. The appearance of Jabra'il is accompanied by a rapture with which Daniel (a) was enchanted and fell unconscious. In another part of the Book of Daniel, Jabra'il flies to Daniel (a) when he was praying and slaughtering for the sake of God to reveal some secrets to him. In these cases, Jabra'il is not referred to as an angel; rather as a heavenly being who carries God's message and whose appearance is accompanied by a divine rapture Twice in the Gospel of Luke: here he is referred to as the angel who gives the prophet Zechariah (a) (or Zakariyya) the good news that he would have a son, John the Baptist (or Yahya (a) ). He also gave Mary (or Maryam (a)) the good news that she would have a son, Jesus. It is said that Jabra'il figures in the Old Testament merely as manifesting the divine might, but he figures in the New Testament as an assuring character as well. It is also said that the 4 times in which Jabra'il figures in the Bible are somewhat relevant to the divine promise of Jesus being born. Unofficial Books Jabra'il prominently figures in unofficial books between Torah and Gospel and was elevated to one of the nearest angels to God. In the Aramaic translation and interpretation of the Torah, Jabra'il has more roles to play. Contributions to some events are attributed to him, which occurred in the early periods of the Old Testament; for example, they allege that he guided the prophet, Joseph (a), or attended the burial of the Prophet, Moses (a). Additionallyو in some Jewish writings, Jabra'il, who is conceived to be made of fire, is, along with Michael, Uriel and Raphael, one of the four angels who reside around the Throne (al-'Arsh). Moreover, he is taken to be one of the angels who met the prophet, Abraham (a) and destroyed Sodom (a city in which the People of Lot lived). Ranking among the Angels Although Jabra'il became increasingly more valuable and higher-ranking in both the Jewish and Christian traditions and his image as a winged angel found its way to paintings, he was never deemed as valuable as Mika'il neither in the Jewish tradition (in which Mika'il is taken to be the permanent defender of the Jewish people), nor in the Christian tradition. He was always second to Mika'il in these traditions. In Islamic Philosophy In the texts of Islamic philosophy and mysticism, Jabra'il is associated with notions such as intellect and spirit. Ibn Sina takes the \"intellects\" (al-'uqul) to be the nearest angels to God, and in his explanation of revelation (wahy), he maintains that the Prophet Muhammad (s) was connected to the Active Intellect through which he received his revelations. Ibn Sina calls the angel who revealed the wahy \" Ruh al-Qudus \" (the Holy Spirit), taking him to the noblest spirit and a holy soul or a medium between God (the Necessary Being) and the First Intellect . Shahab al-Din al-Suhrawardi takes Jabra'il to be the Tenth Intellect and the last word in the Arc of Descent and among divine words. In the terminologies of the Illuminationist Philosophy , Jabra'il is one of the al-Anwar al-qahira (Victorious Lights)—it is the biggest of these lights which holds the spell of the human archetype. Al-Suhrawardi takes the genesis of the Elemental and Sensuous World as well as human souls to be caused by the acts of Jabra'il. He also attributes to him the acts of giving life, giving knowledge, and giving virtues. According to al-Suhrawardi, Jabra'il or Ruh al-Qudus (the Holy Spirit) brings human souls from potentiality to actuality. If human beings have the required disposition, they can connect to him and enjoy his treasury of knowledge and virtues. On this view, the relation between Jabra'il and human souls is that of the sun with the eyes or the pen with a paper. Thus, Jabra'il is the medium of the existence and knowledge of human souls. Mulla Sadra identifies Jabra'il with the Holy Spirit and the Active Intellect. On his view, Jabra'il is the angel of guidance. He has a prominent role in the perfection of souls. He is the medium by which knowledge is given to souls and wahy is revealed to prophets . According to Mulla Sadra, in giving knowledge to human beings, Jabra'il treats everyone in an equal way, although the degree to which knowledge is acquired varies with the difference in human dispositions and capacities which prepare the ground for the connection with Jabra'il or the Active Intellect. In Mulla Sadra's view, Jabra'il has two positions with respect to which he is referred to with different titles: so long as he did not descend from the heaven of immateriality and proximity to God, he is called the \"Holy Spirit\" (Ruh al-Qudus), and when he descends from there and embodies in a mundane form, he is called the Spirit (al-Ruh). Abu Ya'qub al-Sajistani , an Isma'ili scholar, has coined three terms, \"Jadd\" (ancestor), \"Fath\" (opening), and \"Khiyal\" (imagination), and applied them respectively to Jabra'il, Mika'il, and Israfil. \"Jadd\" is the determining factor in the happiness and misery of human beings. If \"Jadd\" supports a pure soul, they will turn into teachers of their times, guiding people to divine satisfaction. Lights of the divine kingdom reach the person through the \"Jadd\". Whenever the lights—the messages—are vague and indistinct, \"Fath\" (Mika'il) will open—that is, decipher—them. In Islamic Mysticism In Islamic mystical texts, Jabra'il is referred to as the origin of life, the manifestation of divine knowledge, the embodied form of intellect, the assignee of knowledge-acquisition and the management of livelihoods, and the teacher of prophets. He is one of the 4 angels who carry the Divine Throne (al-'Arsh) before the resurrection , and one of the 8 angels who do so at the time of the resurrection. According to al-Fanari, Jabra'il's stance is in Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree) which is an intermediate world between the natural elemental world and the world of constant universal nature containing the Imaginal World ('alam al-mithal), the Throne (al-'Arsh), al-Kursi , and the like. Thus, the form of Jabra'il as appearing in this stance includes the characteristics of what is above and beneath the Lote (Sidra). Jabra'il is the holder of divine words. Sayyid Haydar al-Amuli identifies Jabra'il with the First Intellect in some respect, but according to al-Jayli, God created Jabra'il in the eternity from the First Intellect, which is identical to the spirituality of the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Thus, the Prophet (s) is the father of Jabra'il and the origin of the whole world. This is why in the night of mi'raj , Jabra'il—who is inferior in his ranking to the Prophet (s)—could continue the holy journey along with the Prophet (s) and stay at the stance of the Utmost Lote Tree. He believes that the Muhammadi Reality (al-Haqiqat al-Muhammadiyya) or \"Ruh\" (the Spirit) is the noblest angel and the highest-ranking creature, of which many angels—including Jabra'il—are a form and from which they are created. \"Ruh al-Qudus\" (the Holy Spirit) and \"Ruh al-Amin\" (the Trusted Spirit) are not, according to al-Jayli, specific titles of Jabra'il. In his view, Jabra'il is called \"Rul al-Amin\" because his origin (the First Intellect, that is, the Prophet Muhammad (s)) is Ruh al-Amin. In the terminology of Sufis, Jabra'il is also referred to as \"Ruh al-Ilqa'\" (the Spirit of Suggestion, because it suggests the Knowledge of the Hidden to the hearts). Identification of Simurgh with Jabra'il In the Islamic mystical literature, some people have proposed the possibility of applying the characteristics of Simurgh to Jabra'il. Simurgh is a mythical, sacred, and supernatural bird. This has been compared with Jabra'il's characterization as having large wings and feathers and a huge body. Simurgh's support of Zal in ancient texts of the Persian literature, and his mediation for the transfer of hidden forces to Zal are similar to the relation between Jabra'il and the Prophet Muhammad (s). The tree or a mountain in which Simurgh resides has immaterial features. The tree, called \"Tuba\", comes out of mountains and is the mother of all plants and vegetables. Every morning when Simurgh flies out of its nest and spreads its wings over the Earth, all the fruits appearing on trees and all vegetables growing on the Earth result from its feathers. Correspondingly, Jabra'il is said to reside in Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Utmost Lote Tree) which is a monumental tree, to which the acts of the creatures and the positions of the prophets and angels go back. Simurgh is the king of all birds, and what appears in Ibn Sina 's Risala al-tayr and Ahmad al-Ghazali 's story of birds regarding the journey of the birds to Simurgh by traveling different stations and stages is very similar to the stages of the development of the soul to reach the stage of Acquired Intellect (al-'Aql al-Mustafad) and the connection with the Active Intellect (which is Jabra'il). Simurgh's Support of Mystics Mulla Sadra quoted mystics as saying that in order for creatures to achieve all the various perfections that they can achieve and in order for mystical wayfarers to reach their desires and destinations, they should be helped by this sacred bird. Mystical Characteristics of Jabra'il In his Persian essay, Awaz-i par-i Jabra'il (The sound of Jabra'il's feather), inspired by what appears in the Qur'an concerning the features of the angels' wings and in hadiths concerning the wings of Jabra'il, al-Suhrawardi maintains that Jabra'il, because of having two wings, is superior to angels who have 3 or 4 wings, because 2 is closer than all other numbers to 1. He has also referred to the right wings of Jabra'il being bright and his left wings being dark. Light or brightness is, for al-Suhrawardi, a symbol of existence, and darkness is a symbol of non-existence, and except \"Nur al-Anwar\" (the light of the lights) who is a mere light and the essentially Necessary Being, every other being is contingently existent, and this is the reason why Jabra'il's left-wing is dark. The souls are created from Jabra'il's right-wing which is bright, and the material world is created from his left-wing which is dark. Moreover, the suggestion of knowledge to prophets and saints of God is attributed to his right-wing, but catastrophes, cries, and accidents are attributed to his left-wing. Moreover, according to Mulla Sadra's account, mystics hold that the sacred bird, Simurgh, residing the mythical mountain, Cafcuh (or Qaf), has a cry that awakens the asleep in darkness and reminds ignorant people of divine signs. However, there are few people who listen to his cry and know his song. If one understands his language, he will understand the language of all the birds. In Persian poems, \"Shahpar\" (the king feather) or \"Par-i Jabra'il\" (Jabra'il's feather) is also frequently used. It is alleged to have features such as protection against enemies, preventing the damages of fire and water, and recovering wounds. Jabra'il is also known as \"Tawus al-Mala'ika\" (the Peacock of Angels), \"Our Father\", and the \"Logos\" (the Universal Intellect).

{"title": "Israfil", "text": "Isrāfīl (Arabic: إسْرافیل ) is an angel commissioned to blow the Trumpet (see: Nafkh al-Sur ) when this world comes to an end and the resurrection begins. According to hadiths , this angel is one of the close angels to God and his tasks include blowing the Trumpet , delivering divine messages to other angels, and receiving the daily records of people from angels appointed to record people's actions. He also carried out significant missions, such as waking up Seven Sleepers (Ashab al-Kahf) from many years of sleep, helping the Prophet Muhammad (s) in the Battle of Badr , and accompanying the Prophet (s) in Mi'raj . Features and Characteristics Israfil is one of the close angels to God known mainly for blowing the Trumpet to announce the end of this world. In hadiths, his name is said to be \"'Abd al-Rahman\" and his kunya is \"Abu l-Manafikh\". The word, \"Israfil\", does not appear in the Qur'an , but there are verses concerning blowing the Trumpet which is, according to hadiths, undertaken by Israfil. According to hadiths, this angel is the manifestation of the divine attribute , al-Rahman , and the manifestation of the tenet of \"life\" in the Preserved Slate (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). He was the first to mention \"subhan rabbi al-a'la wa bi-hamdih\" (exalted is my Lord the Highest and I praise Him). According to hadiths, Israfil has 12 wings one of which is located in the east of the world and the other is located in the west, and 'Arsh (the Throne) is located on his shoulder, but in comparison to the greatness of God, he is smaller than a sparrow. He sees himself to be so little in comparison to God that he hides himself under one of his wings out of shame. According to Shiite theologians and philosophers , angels are immaterial beings, and so their wings are not like those of material birds. Tasks According to hadiths, an important task of Israfil is to blow the Trumpet . Israfil has an army of angels at his disposal, and when the time of the resurrection approaches, God orders them to prepare the grounds for the resurrection. After that, Israfil blows the Trumpet after which everything in this world dies and the world comes to an end. He then blows the Trumpet again after which everything comes back to life and the resurrection begins. Some scholars take Israfil to be one of the angels who carry God's Throne . He is also taken to be commissioned to deliver God's messages to other angels. For example, when God wants to reveal something to a prophet , He shows the Preserved Slate to Israfil who then reveals what he saw to Jabra'il . According to another hadith, when Nimrud threw the prophet Abraham (a) into the fire, Israfil was the first angel who went to help him at the command of God. Other tasks have also been attributed to Israfil in hadiths, including: Lifting the divine punishment from the people of the prophet Jonah (a) , Destroying the people of the prophet Lot (a) , Waking up the Seven Sleepers after years of sleep, Accompanying the Prophet Muhammad (s) for three years before Bi'that , Helping the Prophet (s) in the Battle of Badr , Accompanying the Prophet (s) in his Mi'raj , Saying funeral prayer on the Prophet's (s) corpse, Giving Abraham (a) the good news of the birth of his son Isaac (a) , Reciting the adhan in the skies, Receiving the records of people's actions from angels who are assigned with the task of recording the actions, Helping the Muslim armies at the End Time (or Akhir al-Zaman ). Virtues There are four great and close angels before God: Israfil, Jabra'il , Mika'il , and 'Izra'il who are known as the \"Heads of Angels\". According to hadiths, God has created Israfil, Jabra'il and Mika'il from one tasbih , and Israfil and Jabra'il are said to be the closest creatures to God, because there are only four veils between them and God, while there are 70,000 veils between God and other creatures. According to a hadith, the Prophet (s) always addressed God in his midnight supplications as follows: \"O Allah, the Lord of Jabra'il and Mika'il and Israfil\", and Imam al-Sajjad (a) prayed for Israfil as follows: \"O Allah! Send regards to Israfil who is the owner of the Trumpet and is waiting for your command to blow the Trumpet and wake up the sleepers of the graves\". Israfil in Religions and Cultures In the Torah , there are angels known as \"Seraphs\" who are sitting on the Throne and recite the dhikr : \"holy, holy, holy\". Although there are hadiths in Islamic sources concerning Israfil's exaltation of God and his carrying the Throne, it refers to a single angel, but \"Seraphs\" in Judaism refers to a group of angels. Blowing the Trumpet by Israfil is not dissimilar to Shiva in Hinduism who makes people die or come back to life by banging a drum. People of ancient Egypt also believed that people of the Heaven enjoy the hearing of the songs of Israfil. Also, a scholar of the ancient Levant talked about a singing angel called \"Israfil\" who exalts God and as a result, residents of the sky quit their worships and listen to his exaltation.

Qur'an 55:41 When Imam Mahdi (a) returns, God bestows upon him the ability to know people by their faces. 40 By the Lord of the sky and the earth, it is indeed the truth, just as [it is a fact that] you speak. Qur'an 51:23 In a hadith from Imam al-Sajjad (a), “the truth” is said to refer to the uprising of Imam Mahdi (a). 41 And be on the alert for the day when the caller calls from a close quarter, (41) the day when they hear the Cry in all truth. That is the day of rising [from the dead]. (42) Qur'an 50 : 41-42 In a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), it is said that “the Cry” will be in the name of Imam Mahdi (a) and “the day of rising” refers to the day of Imam Mahdi’s rising. 42 Had they been separate, We would have surely punished the faithless among them with a painful punishment. Qur'an 48:25 According to a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), the verse means that the punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers will be delayed until their believing descendants are be born and then the Twelfth Imam (a) will rise. 43 Say to the faithful to forgive those who do not expect Allah’s days, that He may [Himself] requite every people for what they used to earn. Qur'an 45:14 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that the day of the return of Mahdi (a) is among the days of God. 44 Do they not consider that the Hour may overtake them suddenly while they are unaware?

Qur'an 42:41 According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a), this verse points to the punishment of the Umayyads, deniers of truth, and the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt (a). 46 Whoever desires the tillage of the Hereafter, We will enhance for him his tillage, and whoever desires the tillage of the world, We will give it to him, but he will have no share in the Hereafter. Qur'an 42:20 “He will have no share in the hereafter” is interpreted to mean, he will have no share during the reign of Imam Mahdi (a). 47 Soon We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own souls until it becomes clear to them that He is the Real. Qur'an 41:53 Imam al-Baqir (a) has interpreted this verse as referring to the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 48 ...We might make them taste a humiliating punishment in the life of the world... Qur'an 41:16 The “punishment of disgrace” in this verse is said to mean the punishment of the staunch deniers of truth in this world prior to the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 49 As for [the people of] Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness to guidance. So the bolt of a humiliating punishment seized them because of what they used to earn. Qur'an 41:17 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have interpreted Thamud in this verse as referring to a group of the Shia who, like the historical people of Thamud, denied the truth. The Imam (a) also reportedly interpreted the “bolt” as referring to the punishment of sword upon the return of the Twelfth Imam. 50 The earth will glow with the light of her Lord, Qur'an 39:69 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that the lord of the earth is the Imam of the earth whose light will illuminate the earth. 51 and you will surely learn its tidings in due time.’ Qur'an 38:88 It is said, in a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a), that the “due time” refers to the time of the return of al-Mahdi (a). 52 Indeed Abraham was among his followers, Qur'an 37:82 According to a hadith, this verse is about the Imams (a), including Imam Mahdi (a) and his followers. 53 Were you to see them when they will be stricken with terror, without any escape, and are seized from a close quarter. Qur'an 34:51 According to a number of hadiths from the Prophet (s) and Imam al-Baqir (a), among the instances of this verse is the revolt of al-Sufyani near the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 54 Say, ‘On the day of judgement their [newly found] faith will not avail the faithless, nor will they be granted any respite.’ Qur'an 32:29 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said, the “day of victory” is the day when the world will be subdued to al-Mahdi (a). 55 We shall surely make them taste the nearer punishment prior to the greater punishment, so that they may come back. Qur'an 32:21 It is said, in a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), that “the greater punishment” is the uprising of Imam Mahdi (a) with sword during the end times. 56 and on that day the faithful will rejoice Qur'an 30:04 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that the rejoicing of believers is on the day of the return of al-Mahdi (a). 57 If We wish We will send down to them a sign from the sky before which their heads will remain bowed in humility. Qur'an 26:4 Imam al-Baqir (a) reportedly said that this verse is about Mahdi (a), whose name will be announced from heaven. 58 Tell me, should We let them enjoy for some years, (205) then there comes to them what they have been promised, (206) of what avail to them will be that which they were given to enjoy? (207) Qur'an 26 :205-207 In a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a), it is said that “that [which] they were promised” refers to the return of Imam Mahdi (a) and “the enjoyment of the days they were given” refers to the Umayyad rule. 59 Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is a niche wherein is a lamp—the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star—lit from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil almost lights up, though fire should not touch it. Light upon light. Qur'an 24:35 According to a hadith, the light of God in this verse refers to Imam Mahdi (a). 60 Those who, if We granted them power in the land, will maintain the prayer, give the zakat, bid what is right and forbid what is wrong. And with Allah rests the outcome of all matters. Qur'an 22:41 In some hadiths, this verse is said to be about Imam Mahdi (a) and his companions. 61 They say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘[The knowledge of] the Unseen belongs only to Allah. So wait. I too am waiting along with you.’ Qur'an 10:20 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have interpreted the “hidden” in this verse as referring to Imam Mahdi (a). 62 Do those who devise evil schemes feel secure that Allah will not make the earth swallow them, or the punishment will not overtake them whence they are not aware?

So do not seek to hasten it. Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]. Qur'an 16:1 According to some hadith, the command of God in this verse refers to the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 64 When the apostles lost hope and they thought that they had been told lies, Our help came to them, and We delivered whomever We wished, and Our punishment will not be averted from the guilty lot. Qur'an 12:110 Imam Ali (a) is reported to have said that believers will have a difficult life during the occultation until God blesses them with the return of Mahdi (a). 65 O you who have faith! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those vested with authority among you. Qur'an 4:59 It is said the hidden Imam will benefit people as the sun behind clouds benefits people. 66 Do they seek a religion other than that of Allah, while to Him submits whoever there is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be brought back? Qur'an 3:83 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that this verse refers to the return of Imam Mahdi (a) and the guidance of all people to the One God at his time. 67 The day when some of your Lord’s signs do come, faith shall not benefit any soul that had not believed beforehand and had not earned some goodness in its faith. Say, ‘Wait! We too are waiting!’ Qur'an 6:158 Imam al-Sadiq (a) reportedly said, “the day when some of your Lord’s sings do com” refers to the day of the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 68 Among the people of Moses is a nation who guide [the people] by the truth and do justice thereby. Qur'an 7:159 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that some of the believers among the people of Moses (a) will be among the companions of Imam Mahdi (a). 69 He said, ‘If only I had the power to deter you, or could take refuge in a mighty support!’ Qur'an 11:80 Imam al-Sadiq (a) reportedly interpreted the “power” as referring to the power of Imam Mahdi (a) and “a mighty support” to his companions and supporters. 70 Those who are fought against are permitted [to fight] because they have been wronged, and Allah is indeed able to help them Qur'an 22:39 Imam al-Sadiq (a) has reportedly said that this verse is about Mahdi (a) who will revenge for the murder of Imam al-Husayn (a) . 71 Indeed they are devising a stratagem, (15) and I [too] am devising a plan. (16) So respite the faithless; give them a gentle respite. (17) Qur'an 86 :15-17 Imam al-Sadiq (a) is reported to have said that respiting the faithless means respiting them until the return of Imam Mahdi (a). 72 Is He who answers the call of the distressed [person] when he invokes Him and removes his distress, and makes you successors on the earth...? What! Is there a god besides Allah? Little is the admonition that you take. Qur'an 27:62 In some hadiths, this verse is referred to the uprising of Imam Mahdi (a) and “the distressed” is said to indicate him.

{"title": "Izra'il", "text": "Azrael or ʿIzrā'īl (Arabic: عِزرائیل ) is the Angel of Death, an angel close to God who is assigned by Him to take the lives of living beings. Azrael takes the lives of prophets (a) and saints on his own, and he has agents who take the lives of other beings. When Azrael takes the lives of all living beings, God will take his own life. Name and Features \"Azrael\" has a Hebrew origin, consisting of two parts (\"Azra\" and \"el\") where the first part means servant and the second means God, and so the phrase literally means \"the servant of God\". The word found its way to Arabic (by transforming into \"'Izra'il\") through the Syriac language. Azrael is referred to in the Qur'an as \"Malak al-Mawt\" (the Angel of Death): \"Say: \"The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will take your souls: then shall ye be brought back to your Lord\"\". He is also referred to in hadiths as \"Qābiḍ al-Arwāḥ\" ( قابض الأرواح , literally: taker of the souls) and \"Hādim al-Dhāt\" ( هادِم الذات , literally: destroyer of the essence). According to hadiths , Azrael is a manifestation of divine attributes, \"al-Qābiḍ\" ( القابض ) and \"al-Mumīt\" ( المُمیت ), because it is God who expands people's souls or grasps them, although He does this with His agents, such as angels and Azrael. Azrael, Mika'il , Israfil , and Jabra'il are characterized as \"Heads of Angels\" (Ru'us al-Mala'ika). According to some hadiths, the preserved tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) consists of four elements: knowledge, life, will, and power, and Azrael is a manifestation of its power. According to some hadiths, in the last moments of the Prophet Muhammad's (s) life, Fatima (a) and Azrael, who was permitted to enter the Prophet's (s) house, had a conversation. Also, some physical properties are attributed to Azrael in some sources of hadiths, such as having four wings which cover the four sides of the whole world with his feet in the bottom of the world and his head in the sky. However, according to Shiite theologians , the wings of angels are not analogous to those of birds, since they are immaterial entities. Their attributes are cashed out in hadiths in ways that are understandable by laypeople. Tasks According to some hadiths, when God wanted to create Adam , He ordered the angels to bring Him part of the soil on the Earth, but none of them could do this except Azrael, because he was the only angel who enjoyed the divine power and dominance. Thus, God appointed him to take the lives of living beings. Azrael takes the lives of prophets and saints on his own, but the lives of other living beings are taken by his agents. There is a question of how Azrael can take the lives of many living beings throughout the world at the same time. To this question, philosophers and theologians have answered as follows: Azrael is an immaterial, spiritual entity, and so he is not located in a particular place and so, he does not move from one place to another. In fact, the whole material world is the same for Azrael. So, he takes the lives of many living beings at the same time by calling them to himself. There are many verses of the Qur'an with regard to how the soul is taken or grasped: in some Quranic verses, the grasping of the souls is attributed to God; in others, it is attributed to Azrael, and in others, it is attributed to other angels. According to exegetes of the Qur'an, these verses do not contradict one another, because God is the ultimate cause of taking lives, but the task is sometimes carried out by Azrael and sometimes by other angels. Assistants The Quranic verse, \"when death comes to one of you, Our angels take his soul\", shows that people's deaths are undertaken by a group of angels, and so, Azrael has many assistants and agents to take the lives of people. The angels are referred to in the Qur'an as \"Nāzi'āt\" ( نازعات , pluckers), \"Sābiḥāt\" ( سابحات , swimmers), and \"Sābiqāt\" ( سابقات , outsrippers) who are assigned with different tasks of taking the lives. For example, \"Nāshiṭāt\" ( ناشطات , drawers) are commissioned to take the lives of believers gently, and \"Nazi'at\" are commissioned to take the lives of unbelievers forcefully. According to Quranic verses, unbelievers die with a lot of pain and torture. Angels of death surround them and beat them behind them and in front of them, but the lives of believers are taken by the angels of mercy. They are treated gently and are given the good news of going to the Heaven . Death of Azrael When Israfil blows the Trumpet (see: Nafkh al-Sur ) for the first time at the end of the world, all living beings will die, except Azrael and some other angels. After the first blow of the Trumpet, when Azrael takes the lives of other angels who were initially excluded from death, God will take the life of Azrael.

{"title": "Michael", "text": "Michael or Mīkāʾīl (Arabic: میکائیل ) is an archangel assigned with the important responsibility of providing sustenance and livelihood to humanity. He is mentioned in the Qur'an . According to hadiths, Michael is an angel of mercy, a carrier of the Divine Throne , and one of the first angels who prostrated before Adam (a) . Other duties attributed to him include \"expanding the chest\" of the Prophet (s) , protecting him during Laylat al-Mabit , aiding Muslims in the Battle of Badr , and facilitating the Prophet's (s) journey on Buraq during the Night of Ascension (Mi'raj). Additionally, the Bible refers to him as the leader of all angels. His Place Michael, or Mika'il, is an archangel close to God. In the Qur'an , he is referred to as Mikal. Many Sunni exegetes of the Qur'an as well as some Shi'a exegetes cite hadiths to show that he is the angel of mercy. Furthermore, according to some hadiths, the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) has four tenets, one of which (the tenet of will) is epitomized by Michael. In addition, Michael is the manifestation of God’s name “Lord” (Rabb), and a carrier of the Divine Throne. Michael, Gabriel , Israfil , and Azrael are considered as the four archangels who hold a special position close to God. They are described as “leading angels” or “archangels.” In hadiths, Michael is deemed the second closest angel to God, after Gabriel. The Qur'an says about him that “Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.” As per some hadiths, Michael, Gabriel, and Israfil were created from a single exaltation of God. During his midnight prayers, the Prophet (s) addressed God as \"O Lord of Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil.\" Imam 'Ali (a) has stated in a hadith that Michael is the imam or leader of all angels. In the \" frequented house \" (al-Bayt al-Ma'mur), all angels pray behind Michael. Imam al-Sajjad (a) prays for Michael as follows: \"O God, bestow peace and greetings upon Michael, who holds a standing position with You and a place of great obedience. Duties According to Shiite hadiths, God provides sustenance and livelihood to all of His creatures through the angel Michael. Moreover, on the day of resurrection , he is said to be responsible for setting up the Sirat Bridge over the Hell . There are also some hadiths that describe him as the angel in charge of bringing rain and having performed other duties, including: Participation in vanquishing the Pharaoh ’s people Participation in vanquishing the Lot ’s people Giving the good tidings of Prophet Isaac ’s birth to Prophet Abraham (a) Receiving the news from Israfil and delivering it to Gabriel Protecting the Prophet (s) on the Laylat al-Mabit Aiding the Muslims during the Battle of Badr Bringing Buraq for the Prophet (s) on the Night of Ascension Performing a prayer for the Prophet's (s) corpse [16] According to some hadiths, Michael and Gabriel were among the first angels who prostrated for Adam (a). Moreover, they “expanded the breast” (sharh al-sadr) of the Prophet (s). In Other Religions In Jewish and Christian sources, Michael is described as an archangel holding a special position close to God. He is also called Michel. For Jews, Michael counts as a constant supporter of the Jewish people, holding a rank higher than even Gabriel. Moreover, the Bible ( Book of Daniel 10, 12) characterizes Michael as the leader of all angels who aids Daniel to defeat his enemies. The Epistle of Jude describes Michael as the leader of the angels who engages in a conflict with Satan over the body of Prophet Moses (a) , warning him that Yahweh would reproach him. In the Book of Revelation by John, Michael is mentioned along with an army of angels who fight against a dragon. Notes References"}
{"title": "Iblis", "text": "Iblīs (Arabic: اِبلیس ) is the name of a jinn who did not prostrate before Adam (a) and was dismissed from his position. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an , he was an angel . The word, \"Iblis\", has been used 11 times in the Qur'an—9 times in the story of the creation of Adam (a) and the order to prostrate for him. The word, \"Shaytan\" (Satan) and its plural form, \"Shayatin\", are used 88 times in the Qur'an in many cases of which they refer to Iblis. When he refused to prostrate for Adam (a), he was cursed by God and as a result was dismissed from his position. He then supplicated to God to allow him to stay alive until the Day of Judgement . God accepted his request and gave upon him immortality up to a fixed date. Therefore, Iblis swears to misdirect people—the children of Adam—as long as he has time. Since then, he is engaged in skewing the attention of the humans of God and wooing them into perpetrating wicked acts and villainy. He and his recruits are promised to meet the hell fire, eventually. Etymology There are two views about the etymology of the word, \"Iblis\": Some philologists [1] and exegetes of the Qur'an [2] take \"Iblis\" to be an Arabic word from the root, \"b-l-s\" ( ب-ل-س ). The root literally means disappointment, remorse, frustration, sorrow out of fear, regret, and wonder. Iblis was called so because he was disappointed about any divine mercy. [3] On this view, \"Iblis\" is diptote [4] because it is very similar to non-Arabic words. [5] Most philologists take \"Iblis\" to come from non-Arabic languages, and take the reason for its being diptote to be that it is a non-Arabic proper name. [6] Other Names of Iblis According to some hadiths , Iblis's original name was Ḥārith ( حارث ) or Ḥarath ( حَرَث ) who later came to be called \"'Azāzīl\" (God's dear) because he worshiped God for long periods of time. When he became proud of himself he was called Iblis, and when he refused to prostrate for Adam (a) and was dismissed from the divine court he came to be called \"Shaytan\" (Satan). His other names are \"Ḍarīs\" ( ضریس ), \"Sarḥūb\" ( سرحوب ), \"al-Mutakawwin\" ( المتکوّن ), and \"al-Mutakawwiz\" ( المتکوّز ). Zoroastrians call him \"Angra Mainyu\". Iblis's kunyas and titles are: Abu Murra (Abu Qurra), Abu Kardus, Abu Lubna (attributed to his daughter's name), Na'il, Abu l-Hasban, Abu Khilaf, and Abu Dajjana. Relationship between Iblis and Shaytan \"Iblis\" is used 11 times in the Quran, 9 of which occurred in the story of the creation of Adam (a) and God's order to prostrate for him. The words, \"Shaytan\" and \"Shayatin\", occurred 88 times in the Quran in many cases of which they refer to Iblis. \"Shaytan\" is a generic noun referring to any vicious, disobedient, and deceiving creature. An examination of the uses of the word, \"Shaytan\", in the Quran and what the exegetes have said shows that in most cases, \"Shaytan\" refers to Iblis or at least has him as his primary referent. Some people hold that \"Shaytan\" is often used to refer to Iblis and is almost a proper name. According to others, \"al-Shaytan\" is always equivalent to \"Iblis\". The Story of Iblis As narrated in the verses of Qur'an 7 , the story is that when God created the human being— Adam (a) —from mud and blew His spirit in it, He ordered the angels to prostrate for Adam (a). All the angels prostrated except Iblis. He was being proud and refused to prostrate for Adam (a). When God asked him why, he said: \"I am superior to Adam (a), since you have made me from fire and him from mud.\" Then God dismissed Iblis from where he was and cursed him. Iblis asked God to let him stay alive until Dooms Day and God gave him a certain time. Then Iblis swore that he would mislead all the servants of God except a selected few, and God promised that He would throw him and his followers into the Hell . There are two other cases in which \"Iblis\" occurs in the Qur'an: In Qur'an 34 :20 [17] referring to the people of Sheba as followers of Iblis. Qur'an 26 :95 [18] concerning the fate of Iblis and his followers on Dooms Day. In volume 60 of Bihar al-anwar , al-'Allama al-Majlisi cited 177 hadiths from the Infallibles (a) regarding Iblis or Shaytan. Iblis's Disbelief (Kufr) The verse 34 of Qur'an 2 and verse 74 of Qur'an 38 say about Iblis that \"he was a disbeliever \". There is a disagreement among the exegetes over whether disbelief ( kufr ) here refers to disbelief out of malice or out of ignorance. Some scholars have appealed to Iblis's admission that he will mislead the servants of God to show that he is not ignorant of the right and wrong, and so his disbelief is out of malice; and other scholars who take disbelief to be essentially incompatible with knowledge of the right path maintain that Iblis's disbelief is out of ignorance. Also, the explanation of why Iblis's disbelief is reported in past tense (\"was\" a disbeliever) has led to various views. Iblis in Other Religions The belief in evil forces has for long been held by different religions and denominations . Thus, there are remarks about the devil—Iblis—and his nature, the extent of his activities, the ways to resist him, where he stays, and his fate in the Scriptures of earlier religions and denominations which are very similar in many cases, though slightly different at some points. The Devil in Zoroastrianism Iblis is referred to in Avesta as Angra Mainyu, and, in Pahlavi, it is called \"Ahriman\" which means \"hostile spirit\" and in Persian literature, it is referred to as \"Gana-Minu\" which means \"destructive spirit\". The Satan in Judaism and Christiaity For Jews and Christians , the Satan—Iblis—is known as a negative, detested creature. Although the creature who deceived Adam (a) and Eve (a) and made them fall from Eden is introduced in the Book of Genesis as a \"snake\", the New Testament explicitly identifies the snake with Iblis. In the Bible, Iblis is identified with the Satan (Shaytan) and the angel of a never-ending well. In Hebrew, he is called \"Abaddon\" and in Greek, it is called \"Apollyon\" (which means destructive). The Bible frequently warns about his temptations and deceptions, characterizing him as follows: The head of demons [27] The head of evil spirits (Poltergeists) [28] The head of evil forces [29] Essentially liar and the father of all liars [30] The true father of disbelievers In the Bible, Iblis is taken to be an angel whose power is so wide-ranging that he is characterized as the ruler of this mundane and sinful world and the source of madness and epilepsy. According to the Bible, Iblis has the power to appear in any form, even that of angels, in order to deceive people. The Bible takes the hardened heart to be easy preys to Iblis, and recommends human beings to equip themselves with divine weapons in order to be able to resist his temptations and deceptions. It also talks about forgiving others in order to prevent Iblis's abuse, and takes marriage to help one be freed from Satanic temptations. Other ways of countering the Satan is to quit any relationships with disbelievers, to rely on God, and to be steadfast. According to the Bible, the eternal fire will be the place and the fate of the Satan and evil spirits. Satan in the Movies Given the Christian conception of the Satan as a powerful and dismissed angel who is the current ruler of this world, many screenwriters and directors have highlighted the independent power of the Satan from God in their work, thus reinforcing Satanism . This is contrary to the Islamic view according to which the Satan is a weak creature who has no control over anything and anyone. Jinn or an Angel There are two views about the nature of Iblis: He was jinn : Hasan al-Basri and Qutada on Ibn Zayd's account, al-Balkhi, al-Rummani, [45] and many others such as al-Sayyid al-Murtada , Abu l-Futuh al-Razi , [46] al-Zamakhshari , [47] al-Qummi, [48] Sayyid Qutb [49] , and Mughniya take Iblis to be jinn. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid attributes this view to the Shi'a , and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi attributes it to Mu'tazilis . [50] Many proponents of this view have appealed to some hadiths . [51] He was an angel: 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas , 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud , Qutada, Sa'id b. Musayyib , Ibn Jurayh, Ibn Anbari, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , al-Baydawi, and some others take Iblis to be an angel. [52] Al-Alusi attributed this view to most of the Sahaba and Tabi'un . [53] Philosophy of Creation and the Time given to Iblis According to some hadiths, after refusing to comply with the divine command to prostrate before Adam (a), and then being dismissed from his position in heaven, Iblis asked God to give him time to live until the day of judgement , and as a reward for his previous worship, God gave him a \"certain (known) time\". Since Iblis is a source of devils, the question is usually asked why God has created him and accepted to give him some time after he was dismissed. Although there are many reasons why Iblis was created and these reasons are comprehensively known only by God, philosophers, theologians and exegetes of the Quran have tried to provide answers to the question. The Fate of Iblis and the \"Certain Time\" There are different accounts of when and how Iblis will die (\"certain time\" in the Quran 38 :80-81): On some accounts, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will decapitate Iblis upon his Reappearance According to another hadith, he will die between the first and the second Blowing of the Trumpet by Israfil . [56] On another hadith, Iblis will be killed by the Prophet Muhammad (s) at the time of raj'a . [57] After citing different hadiths, al-'Allama al-Majlisi concludes that the Satan will be alive until the Dooms Day and will die at the Blowing of the Trumpet. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , there is no necessary relation between human obligations and the existence of the Satan to deceive them. The human society might be reformed, and despite the existence of the Satan, all people might worship God only. In Qur'anic verses, the fate of Iblis and his followers is said to be the Hell . According to such verses, on Dooms Day after the divine judgment, Iblis will declare acquittal with respect to the sins of his followers, holding them responsible for their own actions: \"I had no authority over you except to call you but you listened to me: then reproach not me, but reproach your own selves\" (the Qur'an 14 :22). Finally, they will all be thrown into the Hell. Notes References"}
{"title": "Satan", "text": "Satan or Shayṭān (Arabic: شیطان ) is a common noun for any evil and rebellious creature. With a definite article, it usually refers to Iblis , who did not prostrate himself before Adam (a) and thus was cast out of Heaven . There is disagreement among scholars as to the nature of Satan, but the majority maintain that he was a jinn . The word Shaytan and its plural Shayatin are used eighty-eight times in the Qur'an , and in most cases, Iblis is meant. According to the Qur'an, Satan disobeyed God's command to prostrate himself before Adam (a), and was consequently thrown out of Heaven. He asked God to reprieve him until the Day of Judgment , and God granted his request. In several verses of the Qur'an, God warns humans to beware of the danger of Satan lest they be deceived by his temptations. There are many hadiths that contain information about Satan, his encounters with some of the prophets (a) and Imams (a) , his characteristics, and how to be protected against him. Satan can only tempt human beings and encourage him to sin. Other than that, he has no control over them and cannot force them to commit sins. Satan and his followers are destined to Hell . Terminology There is disagreement among lexicographers as to the origin of the word \"Shaytan\". Some regard it as an originally Arabic word and some consider it an imported word from Hebrew or Syriac. Some maintain that its root is sh-t-n, which means going away, but others believe that the root is sh-y-t, which indicates burning. Satan in the Qur'an The word \"Shaytan\" is mentioned eighty-eight times in the Qur'an : sixty-four times singular and definite, six times singular and indefinite, and eighteen times plural. The word Shaytan and the word \"Mala'ika\" ( angels ) are repeated in the Qur'an the same number of times. In many instances where the word Shaytan is mentioned, Satan is meant by it, but in a few cases, it has been used as a common noun in the sense of an evil and rebellious creature. According to the Qur'an, Satan is a jinn created of fire, who tries to mislead human beings by means of their egos and desires. God has warned humans of Satan's danger in several verses of the Qur'an, and instructed them not to go astray by his temptations. He has introduced Satan as a manifest enemy of mankind and commanded man to consider him as their enemy. Satan can only tempt human beings and encourage them to commit sins; otherwise, he has no power or control over them and cannot force them to do anything. Satan and Iblis The word Shaytan is a common noun, but Iblis is a proper noun. Shaytan indicates any evil and rebellious creature, whether a human being or a jinn, but Iblis is the name of the shaytan who did not prostrate himself before Adam (a) in Heaven and has been trying, with the help of other shaytans, to deceive mankind and lead them astray. From the Islamic viewpoint, Satan does not have an independent power before God, nor has he had any role in creation. In Christianity , however, Satan is an angel , who was cast out of heaven. Satan in hadiths Allama Majlisi has mentioned 177 hadiths regarding shaytan. In these hadiths, the accounts of the encounters of Satan with Prophet Muhammad (s) , Noah (a) , Solomon (a) , Dhu l-Kifl (a) (Ezekiel), Adam (a), Ayyub (a) (Job), Abraham (a) , Yahya (a) (John the Baptist), Moses (a) , Jesus (a) , and Imam Ali (a) are mentioned. Some of these hadiths, especially the one related to Yahya (a), contain moral themes. According to some hadiths, remembering God, saying bismillah (in the name of God) in the beginning of such acts as eating, travelling, making wudu , praying , and sexual intercourse drives away Satan. In some other hadiths, Satan is introduced as the inventor of such acts as sinful singing, gay sex, lying on the belly, and unjustified analogy ( qiyas ). In Imam Ali's al-Qasi'a sermon , some of the characteristics of Satan are mentioned, including envy , zealotry, captiousness, taunting, boasting, and greed. Many scholars maintain that in a few hadiths, the word shaytan refers to germs, and the reason for this usage is that both Satan and germs are invisible to the naked eye and both are harmful. Satan in Other Religions The belief in the existence of Satan or other evil beings is found in various world religions. In many sacred scriptures, one can find materials related to Satan or evil beings, their nature, the extent of their influence, and the ways to confront them. Satan in Zoroastrianism In Zoroastrianism , Angra Mainyu (in Middle Persian: Ahriman) is the \"destructive\" or evil spirit. In the earliest versions of the myth, he stood against Spenta Mainyu (Holy Spirit), his own twin brother, both being the sons of the supreme Zoroastrian deity, Ahura Mazda . In the later versions, Ahura Mazda himself becomes the force of good and Angra Mainyue becomes his evil counterpart. Satan in Judaism and Christianity In Christianity and Judaism , Satan is an evil creature. Although in Genesis , Adam (a) and Eve are said to be deceived by a serpent, in the New Testament , the serpent is identified as Satan. The Bible repeatedly warns against the temptations of Satan and describes him as follows: The chief of devils [12] The chief of evil spirits [13] A murderer since the beginning, who detested the truth; no truth can be found in him; essentially a liar; the father of liars The real father of disbelievers [14] Your enemy, who goes everywhere like a hungry lion to find a prey and devour it. [15] Satan is considered in the Bible an angel. His extent of power is so vast that he is said to be the ruler of this world, the ruler of this sinful world, and the cause of insanity and epilepsy. He can even appear as an angel of light to deceive people. According to the Bible, hardheartedness prepares the ground for his domination, and people are to equip themselves with all divine weapons so that they can resist his temptations and deceptions. Forgiving others in order not to be outwitted by Satan and getting married in order to be immune from Satan's temptations are advised in the Bible. Moreover, distancing oneself from disbelievers, trusting God, and perseverance are mentioned as effective ways for combating Satan. Eternal stay in Hell is regarded in the Bible as the destiny of Satan and evil spirits. The Nature of Satan Some thinkers have identified Satan as human carnal desires, which, if followed blindly, lead him to evil. However, according to the Qur'an, Satan is a real creature that invites human beings to evil, and it is not the same as the human carnal soul or desires. Qur'anic verses such as Qur'an 20 :117 indicate that God informed Adam (a) and Eve about Satan clearly, and verses such as Qur'an 20:120 , and Qur'an 7 :21 , which contain the conversation between Adam (a) and Satan, show that Adam (a) was familiar with Satan in person. According to hadiths, Satan appeared and talked to several prophets such as Noah (a) and Ibrahim (a), and the Imams (a) heard his voice. The Qur'an also indicates that Satan has \"offspring\", a \"party\", and an \"army\". Angel or Jinn There are two viewpoints as to the nature of Satan. Most scholars maintain that he is a jinn , but a minority of scholars, including Ibn 'Abbas , Ibn Mas'ud , Qatada, Sa'id b. Musayyib , Ibn Jurayh, Ibn al-Anbari, al-Tabari , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , al-Baydawi, have considered him an angel. According to al-Alusi, the latter viewpoint was held by most of the Companions and Followers . Satan's Characteristics In the Qur'an , various nouns and adjectives are used to refer to Satan: Mustakbir: Arrogant Kāfir: Faithless Kafur: Ungrateful Fāsiq: Transgressor Āsi: Disobedient Mārid and Marid: Froward Satan Madh'um: Blameful Rajim: Outcast Satan Mad,hur: Banished Mal'un: Cursed Munzar: Reprieved Aduww mubin: Manifest enemy Qarin su': Evil companion Khadhul: Deserter of man Mudil mubin: Misguiding enemy Gharur: Deception Pseudo promiser Caller to the punishment of the Blaze The Wisdom Behind Creating and Reprieving Satan According to the Qur'an, when Satan disobeyed God and refused to prostrate himself before Adam (a), he was cast out of the place he had in heaven . Then, he asked God to reprieve him until the Day of Judgment , and God granted his request. But why did God create this source of evil in the first place, and why did He grant his request and reprieved him? Although only God knows all the wisdom behind His actions, Muslim scholars have given various responses to these questions: Satan Was Not Essentially Evil God did not create Satan as essentially bad and evil. Satan was among the angels and worshippers of God for a very long time (according to some hadiths , 6000 years), but then he rebelled against God by his own choice. Satan is not pure evil, but a mixture of evil and good, and in a holistic view, his existence is better than his non-existence; otherwise, he would not have been created. A Means for Test Satan was created to function as a means for testing mankind. Satan tempts human beings through their carnal desires, and in this way, they are tested. If Satan did not exist, the purpose of worshipping God by choice and willingly following His guidance would not realize. Satan and other sources of evil are not in themselves good or bad for mankind; rather, their goodness or evilness for us depends on our reaction to them. If we follow them, we go astray, but if we oppose them, we grow and reach our ultimate perfection. The Extent of Satan's Activities The Qur'an states that the stratagems of Satan are weak. Satan and his progeny do not have any share in the creation of heavens and earth or even the creation of themselves. Satan's Knowledge of the Hidden Satan, devils, and jinn in general are no longer able to receive Knowledge of the unseen . According to the Qur'an, they said that when they want to eavesdrop, they find \"mighty sentries and flames.\" They do not know about the future of mankind either. In the story of the death of Solomon (a), the jinn only realized that he had died when his body fell on the ground; \"had they known the Unseen, they would not have remained in a humiliating torment\". Qur'an 34 :14. Control Over Human Beings Satan and his tribe do not have any control over mankind. In response to Satan's threat to deceive and lead humans astray, God said, \"Indeed as for My servants, you do not have any authority over them, except the perverse who follow you\". Satan's Incarnation Whether Satan can appear in the form of a human or another creature is a matter of discussion. This is what is meant by incarnation, not the dwelling of Satan in the body of another creature. Some scholars maintain that Satan can appear in all forms other than the form of a prophet or an Imam. According to some hadiths , Satan can appear in all forms other than the forms of the Friends of God and Shiites. The following evidence has been adduced to support the possibility of Satan's incarnation: Satan reportedly appeared in the form of an old man in Dar al-Nadwah and gave the suggestion about murdering the Prophet (s) . In the story of the battle of Badr , it is reported that Satan appeared in the form of a man from the people of Medina and encouraged the polytheists to fight. On the day of Ghadir Khumm , Satan appeared and summoned the devils to find a way to work against the Wilaya of Imam Ali (a) . Those who deny the possibility of the appearance of Satan in other forms adduce Qur'an 7 :27, according to which Satan and his tribe see human beings from where they do not see them. Marriage and Reproduction Some scholars maintain that Satan, like any other creature, reproduces, because the Qur'an states, \"In all things We have created pairs\" . Al-Turayhi reports that God create a wife for Satan from a flame of fire of His wrath. The fruit of this marriage is Satan's progeny, which is mentioned in the Qur'an. There is no mention of the quality or quantity of Satan's reproduction. Al-Turayhi has reported that Satan used to worship God among his people since his youth. When he reached the age of marriage, he married \"Lahba\" the daughter of \"Rawha\" from jinn. She bore many children, who also worshipped and praised God for a long time. Satan's Purposes and Stratagems The Qur'an counts the following among the stratagems of Satan to deceive mankind: Creating enmity [53] Distracting from the remembrance of God and especially from prayer [54] [55] Creating sadness and depression among Muslims and developing fear in their hearts [56] Making people afraid of poverty and other worldly afflictions [57] Adorning sins and evil thought and actions [58] Adorning worldly pleasures [59] Giving false hopes and wishes [60] Promoting corruption, evil, and indecency [61] Encouraging the consumption of wine, idolatry, gambling, and magic. [62] Encouraging to magic [63] Creating envy and conflict [64] [65] Inspiring his followers to dispute with the believers. [66] The Destiny of Satan and His Followers In the story of the creation of Adam (a) , God proclaimed the destiny of Satan and his followers to be Hell and His wrath. According to the Qur'an, when God judges between people on the Day of Judgment , Satan blames his followers and says, \"Indeed Allah made you a promise that was true and I [too] made you a promise, but I failed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me\" . Satanism Satanism means worshipping Satan, a tradition found even today among Satanist groups. According to some scholars, this tradition can be traced back to ancient times, when some people would worship any powerful being, or to the ancient dualism of the god of good and the god of evil. Some Satanist are so called because of their inclination to anti-religious and anti-ethical acts; they are in reality self-worshippers and do not worship Satan as a deity. Magic has a major place in most Satanist traditions. Notes References"}
{"title": "Iblis", "text": "Iblīs (Arabic: اِبلیس ) is the name of a jinn who did not prostrate before Adam (a) and was dismissed from his position. According to some exegetes of the Qur'an , he was an angel . The word, \"Iblis\", has been used 11 times in the Qur'an—9 times in the story of the creation of Adam (a) and the order to prostrate for him. The word, \"Shaytan\" (Satan) and its plural form, \"Shayatin\", are used 88 times in the Qur'an in many cases of which they refer to Iblis. When he refused to prostrate for Adam (a), he was cursed by God and as a result was dismissed from his position. He then supplicated to God to allow him to stay alive until the Day of Judgement . God accepted his request and gave upon him immortality up to a fixed date. Therefore, Iblis swears to misdirect people—the children of Adam—as long as he has time. Since then, he is engaged in skewing the attention of the humans of God and wooing them into perpetrating wicked acts and villainy. He and his recruits are promised to meet the hell fire, eventually. Etymology There are two views about the etymology of the word, \"Iblis\": Some philologists [1] and exegetes of the Qur'an [2] take \"Iblis\" to be an Arabic word from the root, \"b-l-s\" ( ب-ل-س ). The root literally means disappointment, remorse, frustration, sorrow out of fear, regret, and wonder. Iblis was called so because he was disappointed about any divine mercy. [3] On this view, \"Iblis\" is diptote [4] because it is very similar to non-Arabic words. [5] Most philologists take \"Iblis\" to come from non-Arabic languages, and take the reason for its being diptote to be that it is a non-Arabic proper name. [6] Other Names of Iblis According to some hadiths , Iblis's original name was Ḥārith ( حارث ) or Ḥarath ( حَرَث ) who later came to be called \"'Azāzīl\" (God's dear) because he worshiped God for long periods of time. When he became proud of himself he was called Iblis, and when he refused to prostrate for Adam (a) and was dismissed from the divine court he came to be called \"Shaytan\" (Satan). His other names are \"Ḍarīs\" ( ضریس ), \"Sarḥūb\" ( سرحوب ), \"al-Mutakawwin\" ( المتکوّن ), and \"al-Mutakawwiz\" ( المتکوّز ). Zoroastrians call him \"Angra Mainyu\". Iblis's kunyas and titles are: Abu Murra (Abu Qurra), Abu Kardus, Abu Lubna (attributed to his daughter's name), Na'il, Abu l-Hasban, Abu Khilaf, and Abu Dajjana. Relationship between Iblis and Shaytan \"Iblis\" is used 11 times in the Quran, 9 of which occurred in the story of the creation of Adam (a) and God's order to prostrate for him. The words, \"Shaytan\" and \"Shayatin\", occurred 88 times in the Quran in many cases of which they refer to Iblis. \"Shaytan\" is a generic noun referring to any vicious, disobedient, and deceiving creature. An examination of the uses of the word, \"Shaytan\", in the Quran and what the exegetes have said shows that in most cases, \"Shaytan\" refers to Iblis or at least has him as his primary referent. Some people hold that \"Shaytan\" is often used to refer to Iblis and is almost a proper name. According to others, \"al-Shaytan\" is always equivalent to \"Iblis\". The Story of Iblis As narrated in the verses of Qur'an 7 , the story is that when God created the human being— Adam (a) —from mud and blew His spirit in it, He ordered the angels to prostrate for Adam (a). All the angels prostrated except Iblis. He was being proud and refused to prostrate for Adam (a). When God asked him why, he said: \"I am superior to Adam (a), since you have made me from fire and him from mud.\" Then God dismissed Iblis from where he was and cursed him. Iblis asked God to let him stay alive until Dooms Day and God gave him a certain time. Then Iblis swore that he would mislead all the servants of God except a selected few, and God promised that He would throw him and his followers into the Hell . There are two other cases in which \"Iblis\" occurs in the Qur'an: In Qur'an 34 :20 [17] referring to the people of Sheba as followers of Iblis. Qur'an 26 :95 [18] concerning the fate of Iblis and his followers on Dooms Day. In volume 60 of Bihar al-anwar , al-'Allama al-Majlisi cited 177 hadiths from the Infallibles (a) regarding Iblis or Shaytan. Iblis's Disbelief (Kufr) The verse 34 of Qur'an 2 and verse 74 of Qur'an 38 say about Iblis that \"he was a disbeliever \". There is a disagreement among the exegetes over whether disbelief ( kufr ) here refers to disbelief out of malice or out of ignorance. Some scholars have appealed to Iblis's admission that he will mislead the servants of God to show that he is not ignorant of the right and wrong, and so his disbelief is out of malice; and other scholars who take disbelief to be essentially incompatible with knowledge of the right path maintain that Iblis's disbelief is out of ignorance. Also, the explanation of why Iblis's disbelief is reported in past tense (\"was\" a disbeliever) has led to various views. Iblis in Other Religions The belief in evil forces has for long been held by different religions and denominations . Thus, there are remarks about the devil—Iblis—and his nature, the extent of his activities, the ways to resist him, where he stays, and his fate in the Scriptures of earlier religions and denominations which are very similar in many cases, though slightly different at some points. The Devil in Zoroastrianism Iblis is referred to in Avesta as Angra Mainyu, and, in Pahlavi, it is called \"Ahriman\" which means \"hostile spirit\" and in Persian literature, it is referred to as \"Gana-Minu\" which means \"destructive spirit\". The Satan in Judaism and Christiaity For Jews and Christians , the Satan—Iblis—is known as a negative, detested creature. Although the creature who deceived Adam (a) and Eve (a) and made them fall from Eden is introduced in the Book of Genesis as a \"snake\", the New Testament explicitly identifies the snake with Iblis. In the Bible, Iblis is identified with the Satan (Shaytan) and the angel of a never-ending well. In Hebrew, he is called \"Abaddon\" and in Greek, it is called \"Apollyon\" (which means destructive). The Bible frequently warns about his temptations and deceptions, characterizing him as follows: The head of demons [27] The head of evil spirits (Poltergeists) [28] The head of evil forces [29] Essentially liar and the father of all liars [30] The true father of disbelievers In the Bible, Iblis is taken to be an angel whose power is so wide-ranging that he is characterized as the ruler of this mundane and sinful world and the source of madness and epilepsy. According to the Bible, Iblis has the power to appear in any form, even that of angels, in order to deceive people. The Bible takes the hardened heart to be easy preys to Iblis, and recommends human beings to equip themselves with divine weapons in order to be able to resist his temptations and deceptions. It also talks about forgiving others in order to prevent Iblis's abuse, and takes marriage to help one be freed from Satanic temptations. Other ways of countering the Satan is to quit any relationships with disbelievers, to rely on God, and to be steadfast. According to the Bible, the eternal fire will be the place and the fate of the Satan and evil spirits. Satan in the Movies Given the Christian conception of the Satan as a powerful and dismissed angel who is the current ruler of this world, many screenwriters and directors have highlighted the independent power of the Satan from God in their work, thus reinforcing Satanism . This is contrary to the Islamic view according to which the Satan is a weak creature who has no control over anything and anyone. Jinn or an Angel There are two views about the nature of Iblis: He was jinn : Hasan al-Basri and Qutada on Ibn Zayd's account, al-Balkhi, al-Rummani, [45] and many others such as al-Sayyid al-Murtada , Abu l-Futuh al-Razi , [46] al-Zamakhshari , [47] al-Qummi, [48] Sayyid Qutb [49] , and Mughniya take Iblis to be jinn. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid attributes this view to the Shi'a , and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi attributes it to Mu'tazilis . [50] Many proponents of this view have appealed to some hadiths . [51] He was an angel: 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas , 'Abd Allah b. Mas'ud , Qutada, Sa'id b. Musayyib , Ibn Jurayh, Ibn Anbari, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , al-Baydawi, and some others take Iblis to be an angel. [52] Al-Alusi attributed this view to most of the Sahaba and Tabi'un . [53] Philosophy of Creation and the Time given to Iblis According to some hadiths, after refusing to comply with the divine command to prostrate before Adam (a), and then being dismissed from his position in heaven, Iblis asked God to give him time to live until the day of judgement , and as a reward for his previous worship, God gave him a \"certain (known) time\". Since Iblis is a source of devils, the question is usually asked why God has created him and accepted to give him some time after he was dismissed. Although there are many reasons why Iblis was created and these reasons are comprehensively known only by God, philosophers, theologians and exegetes of the Quran have tried to provide answers to the question. The Fate of Iblis and the \"Certain Time\" There are different accounts of when and how Iblis will die (\"certain time\" in the Quran 38 :80-81): On some accounts, Imam al-Mahdi (a) will decapitate Iblis upon his Reappearance According to another hadith, he will die between the first and the second Blowing of the Trumpet by Israfil . [56] On another hadith, Iblis will be killed by the Prophet Muhammad (s) at the time of raj'a .

Forgiving others in order not to be outwitted by Satan and getting married in order to be immune from Satan's temptations are advised in the Bible. Moreover, distancing oneself from disbelievers, trusting God, and perseverance are mentioned as effective ways for combating Satan. Eternal stay in Hell is regarded in the Bible as the destiny of Satan and evil spirits. The Nature of Satan Some thinkers have identified Satan as human carnal desires, which, if followed blindly, lead him to evil. However, according to the Qur'an, Satan is a real creature that invites human beings to evil, and it is not the same as the human carnal soul or desires. Qur'anic verses such as Qur'an 20 :117 indicate that God informed Adam (a) and Eve about Satan clearly, and verses such as Qur'an 20:120 , and Qur'an 7 :21 , which contain the conversation between Adam (a) and Satan, show that Adam (a) was familiar with Satan in person. According to hadiths, Satan appeared and talked to several prophets such as Noah (a) and Ibrahim (a), and the Imams (a) heard his voice. The Qur'an also indicates that Satan has \"offspring\", a \"party\", and an \"army\". Angel or Jinn There are two viewpoints as to the nature of Satan. Most scholars maintain that he is a jinn , but a minority of scholars, including Ibn 'Abbas , Ibn Mas'ud , Qatada, Sa'id b. Musayyib , Ibn Jurayh, Ibn al-Anbari, al-Tabari , al-Shaykh al-Tusi , al-Baydawi, have considered him an angel. According to al-Alusi, the latter viewpoint was held by most of the Companions and Followers . Satan's Characteristics In the Qur'an , various nouns and adjectives are used to refer to Satan: Mustakbir: Arrogant Kāfir: Faithless Kafur: Ungrateful Fāsiq: Transgressor Āsi: Disobedient Mārid and Marid: Froward Satan Madh'um: Blameful Rajim: Outcast Satan Mad,hur: Banished Mal'un: Cursed Munzar: Reprieved Aduww mubin: Manifest enemy Qarin su': Evil companion Khadhul: Deserter of man Mudil mubin: Misguiding enemy Gharur: Deception Pseudo promiser Caller to the punishment of the Blaze The Wisdom Behind Creating and Reprieving Satan According to the Qur'an, when Satan disobeyed God and refused to prostrate himself before Adam (a), he was cast out of the place he had in heaven . Then, he asked God to reprieve him until the Day of Judgment , and God granted his request. But why did God create this source of evil in the first place, and why did He grant his request and reprieved him? Although only God knows all the wisdom behind His actions, Muslim scholars have given various responses to these questions: Satan Was Not Essentially Evil God did not create Satan as essentially bad and evil. Satan was among the angels and worshippers of God for a very long time (according to some hadiths , 6000 years), but then he rebelled against God by his own choice. Satan is not pure evil, but a mixture of evil and good, and in a holistic view, his existence is better than his non-existence; otherwise, he would not have been created. A Means for Test Satan was created to function as a means for testing mankind. Satan tempts human beings through their carnal desires, and in this way, they are tested. If Satan did not exist, the purpose of worshipping God by choice and willingly following His guidance would not realize. Satan and other sources of evil are not in themselves good or bad for mankind; rather, their goodness or evilness for us depends on our reaction to them. If we follow them, we go astray, but if we oppose them, we grow and reach our ultimate perfection. The Extent of Satan's Activities The Qur'an states that the stratagems of Satan are weak. Satan and his progeny do not have any share in the creation of heavens and earth or even the creation of themselves. Satan's Knowledge of the Hidden Satan, devils, and jinn in general are no longer able to receive Knowledge of the unseen . According to the Qur'an, they said that when they want to eavesdrop, they find \"mighty sentries and flames.\" They do not know about the future of mankind either. In the story of the death of Solomon (a), the jinn only realized that he had died when his body fell on the ground; \"had they known the Unseen, they would not have remained in a humiliating torment\". Qur'an 34 :14. Control Over Human Beings Satan and his tribe do not have any control over mankind. In response to Satan's threat to deceive and lead humans astray, God said, \"Indeed as for My servants, you do not have any authority over them, except the perverse who follow you\". Satan's Incarnation Whether Satan can appear in the form of a human or another creature is a matter of discussion. This is what is meant by incarnation, not the dwelling of Satan in the body of another creature. Some scholars maintain that Satan can appear in all forms other than the form of a prophet or an Imam. According to some hadiths , Satan can appear in all forms other than the forms of the Friends of God and Shiites. The following evidence has been adduced to support the possibility of Satan's incarnation: Satan reportedly appeared in the form of an old man in Dar al-Nadwah and gave the suggestion about murdering the Prophet (s) . In the story of the battle of Badr , it is reported that Satan appeared in the form of a man from the people of Medina and encouraged the polytheists to fight. On the day of Ghadir Khumm , Satan appeared and summoned the devils to find a way to work against the Wilaya of Imam Ali (a) . Those who deny the possibility of the appearance of Satan in other forms adduce Qur'an 7 :27, according to which Satan and his tribe see human beings from where they do not see them. Marriage and Reproduction Some scholars maintain that Satan, like any other creature, reproduces, because the Qur'an states, \"In all things We have created pairs\" . Al-Turayhi reports that God create a wife for Satan from a flame of fire of His wrath. The fruit of this marriage is Satan's progeny, which is mentioned in the Qur'an. There is no mention of the quality or quantity of Satan's reproduction. Al-Turayhi has reported that Satan used to worship God among his people since his youth. When he reached the age of marriage, he married \"Lahba\" the daughter of \"Rawha\" from jinn. She bore many children, who also worshipped and praised God for a long time. Satan's Purposes and Stratagems The Qur'an counts the following among the stratagems of Satan to deceive mankind: Creating enmity [53] Distracting from the remembrance of God and especially from prayer [54] [55] Creating sadness and depression among Muslims and developing fear in their hearts [56] Making people afraid of poverty and other worldly afflictions [57] Adorning sins and evil thought and actions [58] Adorning worldly pleasures [59] Giving false hopes and wishes [60] Promoting corruption, evil, and indecency [61] Encouraging the consumption of wine, idolatry, gambling, and magic. [62] Encouraging to magic [63] Creating envy and conflict [64] [65] Inspiring his followers to dispute with the believers. [66] The Destiny of Satan and His Followers In the story of the creation of Adam (a) , God proclaimed the destiny of Satan and his followers to be Hell and His wrath. According to the Qur'an, when God judges between people on the Day of Judgment , Satan blames his followers and says, \"Indeed Allah made you a promise that was true and I [too] made you a promise, but I failed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me\" . Satanism Satanism means worshipping Satan, a tradition found even today among Satanist groups. According to some scholars, this tradition can be traced back to ancient times, when some people would worship any powerful being, or to the ancient dualism of the god of good and the god of evil. Some Satanist are so called because of their inclination to anti-religious and anti-ethical acts; they are in reality self-worshippers and do not worship Satan as a deity. Magic has a major place in most Satanist traditions. Notes References"}
{"title": "Usul al-Din", "text": " Uṣūl al-dīn (Arabic: أصول الدین ) or principles of religion or roots of faith are a set of essential beliefs in Islam that every Muslim needs to believe in; otherwise, one would not be considered a Muslim. Tawhid (oneness of God), nubuwwat (prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) ), and resurrection are the three main principles of Islam. All Islamic sects believe in these three principles; but each one has special principles which separate it from other sects. For the Shi'a , 'adl (justice of God) and imamate are the additional principles. Believing in the principles of religion is obligatory; but there is disagreement as to whether certainty of the principles is required or supposition is enough. Also there is a discussion over the sufficiency of believing in the principles of religion out of emulation . Most religious scholars believe that emulation is not permissible in usul al-din and everyone needs to think about these principles for oneself and accept them with certainty. Definition \"Usul al-din\" is a theological term referring to the fundamental beliefs of Islam the belief in which is required for being considered a Muslim . Such beliefs are called \"usul al-din\" (principles or foundations of the religion) because Islamic disciplines, such as fiqh , usul al-fiqh , the exegesis of the Qur'an , and hadith , are based on them. The word, \"usul al-din\", is contrasted to \" furu' al-din \" (ancillaries of the religion) which refers to the practical rulings of the religion. Muslim theologians have referred to the principles of the religion in different ways such as \"usul al-i'tiqadat\" (Arabic: أصول إعتقادات , principles of beliefs), \"usul al-iman\" (Arabic: أصول إیمان , principles of the faith), \"ummahat 'aqa'id imani\" (Arabic: أمهات عقائد إيماني , the main faith-based beliefs), and \"usul Islami\" (Arabic: أصول الإسلامي , Islamic principles), and so on. However, what they meant to refer with these terms was not restricted to what are taken today as principles of Islam. In many cases, ethical and jurisprudential issues were also referred to as the principles of the religion. For example, al-Ghazali referred to all theological as well as many jurisprudential and ethical issues as the principles of the religion. He considered the prayer and piety as principles of the religion, along with monotheism . According to Misbah Yazdi , \"usul al-din\" is a conventional term which can be used in different meanings. In one convention, it refers to all belief-related propositions of the religion. In another convention, it refers to the fundamental propositions of divine religions or a specific religion. It might as well refer to the principles of a religious denomination; for example, one can say that, for the Shi'a, the principles of the religion consist in monotheism, the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) , the Resurrection , justice , and imamate , just as Morteza Motahhari has considered these five beliefs to be the principles of the religion according to the Shi'a. Instances The principles of Islam consist in monotheism , the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s), and the Resurrection. Anyone who believes in these three doctrines is considered to be a Muslim, and anyone who does not believe in any of these doctrines is not considered as a Muslim. However, there are disagreements among Muslims with respect to the details of these principles. For instance, the majority of Shiite and Mu'tazila theologians believe in the identification of God's Attributes with His Essence, but Ash'aris maintain that God's Attributes are over and above, and external to, His Essence. Morteza Motahhari emphasizes that the Imams (a) did not coin the term, \"usul al-din\", and says: it was coined by scholars in order to indicate the main goals of the religion, for there are many other beliefs in Islam in which a Muslim has to believe, such as the belief in angels and the essentials of the religion , such as prayer and fasting . In the past, no particular criterion was specified for when beliefs count as the principles of a religion or a religious denomination. The significance of an issue in a certain period usually led to its consideration as a principle, such as the problem of Divine Justice that has no privilege over other Divine Attributes , but because of major disagreements between the Shi'a and the Mu'tazila, on the one hand, and the Ash'aris —who constituted the majority of Sunni Muslims— on the other hand, it came to be considered as a principle of the religion for the Shi'a and the Mu'tazila. Principles of a Religious Denomination In addition to the principles of the religion shared by various Islamic denominations, every Islamic denomination involves its own fundamental beliefs that are called the \"principles of the denomination\". For example, Imami Shi'as believe, in addition to the above three principles, in two additional principles: justice and imamate . Therefore, the principles of the Shiite denomination are five. Issues, such as enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong and justice, count as principles of the Mu'tazila denomination. Background The term, \"usul al-din,\" was not used in the Qur'an and hadiths , and was coined by Muslims. It is conjectured that the use of the term, \"al-usul al-khamsa\" (the five principles), by Abu l-Hudhayl al-'Allaf , a Mu'tazili theologian, paved the ground for the use of the word, \"usul al-din\". Since Ibn al-Nadim has attributed a book with the title, \"usul al-din\", to Abu Musa Murdar, some people think that the term was common in early 3rd/9th century. However, in some hadiths from the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) , some religious elements were introduced as tenets of the religion. For example, Sunni Muslims have transmitted a hadith from the Prophet (s) to the effect that Islam is founded on five elements: monotheism, the prophethood of Muhammad (s), the saying of the prayer , paying the zakat , hajj , and fasting in the month of Ramadan . In al-Kafi , Kulayni has narrated a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) that Islam has been built upon five elements: prayer, zakat, fasting, hajj and wilaya and wilaya is superior to other elements. Moreover, in response to a question about things without which faith is not accepted, Imam al-Sadiq (a) mentioned testifying to the oneness of God, belief in the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (a) and what he has brought from God, belief in zakat and accepting the wilaya of Ahl al-Bayt (a). In this hadith, the narrator has referred to these elements as the pillars of Islam. Requirement of Certainty The majority of scholars require certainty with respect to the principles of the religion. In his book, al-Bab al-hadi 'ashar , al-'Allama al-Hilli claimed that scholars had consensus over this requirement, but al-Shaykh al-Ansari cited other views in this regard as well, such as the view according to which it is sufficient to presume, or have probabilistic knowledge (zann) of, the principles of the religion. According to al-Shaykh al-Ansari, it is implied by what is quoted from al-Muhaqqiq al-Ardabili and his student, Sahib al-Madarik , as well as by the writings of al-Shaykh al-Baha'i , al-'Allama al-Majlisi , and Fayd Kashani , that if a person merely presumes the principles of the religion, then he or she counts as a Muslim. Al-Shaykh al-Ansari himself holds, in his al-Rasa'il , that the mere presumption of the principles of the religion is not sufficient for counting as a believer, and that given many hadiths implying the requirement of knowledge, one is obliged to inquire about such principles in order to achieve certainty, if possible. According to al-Shaykh al-Ansari, a person who has not achieved certainty is not a believer, because according to hadiths, knowledge is required for faith. However, such a person does not count as an unbeliever either, because there are many hadiths implying that some Muslims are neither believers, nor unbelievers. Taqlid According to al-Shahid al-Thani in Haqa'iq al-iman , almost all Muslim scholars believe that it is not permissible to follow other people in the principles of the religion, because the belief in such principles should be with certainty, but following other people does not provide one with certainty. Al-Shaykh al-Ansari has reported that the majority of scholars believe that it is obligatory to inquire about and argue for the principles of the religion. However, there are other views here as well. For example, some scholars hold that taqlid or following other people with respect to the principles of the religion is permissible if it yields knowledge. Al-Shaykh al-Ansari himself believes that taqlid in Islamic principles is permissible, because what is required for faith by hadiths is knowledge, and not inquiry. Moreover, because of many doubts about the principles of the belief, one cannot obtain certainty even after a great deal of inquiry. Al-Shaykh al-Tusi also believes that a person who cannot personally inquire about the principles of the religion can follow a scholar in this regard. Today, the first issue that appears in books of tawdih al-masa'il (or manuals of Islamic laws) is taqlid in the principles of the religion. According to the fatwas of marja's , a Muslim should believe in the principles of the religion with certainty and on the basis of arguments. However, some marja's, such as Sayyid Muhammad Rida Gulpayigani , Sayyid 'Ali Sistani , and Lutf Allah Safi Gulpayigani , have added that if one obtains certainty in the principles of the religion, even without any arguments or reasoning, then they count as Muslims. Related Works In most of the theological works a chapter is dedicated to the discussion of usul al-din. However, considering the importance of the issue, there are works dedicated to usul al-din. Some of the most important of such works is as follows, Usul al-din , by al-Muqaddas al-Ardabili , Haqq al-yaqin dar usul-i din wa ma'arif , a Farsi work of al-'Allama al-Majlisi , Al-Arba'in fi usul al-din , by Muhammad al-Ghazali, Al-Arba'in fi usul al-din , by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , Usul al-din , by 'Abd al-Qahir al-Baghdadi.

{"title": "Afterlife Bodies", "text": "Afterlife bodies (Arabic: الأبدان الأُخرویة ) are sorts of bodies that were introduced by Mulla Sadra Shirazi in order to explain bodily resurrection . On the basis of some verses of the Qur'an , Muslims believe that our resurrection will be bodily, that is, humans will have bodies after the resurrection, but there are controversies with respect to the details of the bodily resurrection. Appealing to the apparent meaning of the verses, some Islamic theologians maintain that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same body that they had in this world, and they will undergo the events of the resurrection with this body. In contrast, some philosophers have denied the bodily resurrection; they have instead believed in spiritual resurrection . On the basis of his philosophical foundations in the Transcendental Theosophy , Mulla Sadra accepts bodily resurrection, but gives a new account of it. Views of the Theologians Many verses of the Qur'an are concerned with the resurrection, the Dooms Day , and people's return to God; for example, \"Say, He will revive them who produced them the first time, and He has knowledge of all creation.\" Qur'an 36 :79. \"Does man suppose that We will not put together his bones [at resurrection]? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to [re]shape [even] his fingertips!\" Qur'an 75 :3,4. \"Does he not know, when what is [buried] in the graves is turned over\" Qur'an 100 :9. \"And when the Trumpet is blown, behold, there they will be, scrambling towards their Lord from their graves!\" Qur'an 36:51 The apparent meaning of many verses regarding the resurrection is that human beings will be resurrected from their graves with exactly the same bodies that they had during their life in this world. Most theologians believe that we cannot interpret these verses otherwise; so the bodies with which people will be resurrected are identical with the ones with which they lived in this world. This view is called bodily resurrection . In Shiite theology , the belief in the bodily resurrection is an obligation for any Muslim. But the belief in its specific details is not an obligation. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi says, \"It is an obligation to believe that God will revive all people in the resurrection and He will return people's souls to their original bodies. If anyone denies this or interprets it in such a way that leads to its apparent denial —as we hear some of our contemporary unbelievers— then, by the consensus of all Muslims, they will no longer be believers in Islam . For there are many verses of the Qur'an demonstrating that there will be a new life in the resurrection, and implying that its rejection leads to paganism . And one shall not pay attention to the doubts of philosophers [about bodily resurrection] who say that recreating the nonexistent (I'adat al-Ma'dum) is impossible. One shall not take seriously the interpretations of people who read bodily resurrection as spiritual resurrection . Views of Philosophers Muslim philosophers have tried to provide a rational account of the resurrection and its qualities. Though rational arguments are, in their view, evidence of the necessity of the resurrection and the existence of a world other than this world, the details of how the resurrection will occur—whether it is only spiritual, or both bodily and spiritual, and if it is bodily, whether the body involved is a material, elemental body or it is an imaginal, astral body—cannot be demonstrated by rational, philosophical arguments. This is why Ibn Sina (Avicenna) says: It must be known that part of the resurrection is approved by shari'a , and there is no way to demonstrate it except by shari'a and the testimony of the Prophet (s) —this is the part of it concerning the revival of the dead bodies. We must accept the quality of bodily resurrection and its details in accordance with religious evidence and revelation, since this is the most certain and the most complete criterion for man to acquire assuring truths. On the basis of their philosophical foundations, Peripatetic (masha') philosophers believed that after death, human bodies go out of existence, and since it is philosophically impossible for a nonexistent or annihilated object to come back into existence, human bodies cannot be revived, that is, they cannot re-exist. But the soul, because of its immateriality and spirituality, can never go out of existence, and so it survives the death of its associated body. Since these philosophers could not solve the philosophical problems of bodily resurrection —problems such as the re-existence of nonexistent objects— they have perforce tended to the spiritual resurrection or took it to be philosophically non-provable. Mulla Sadra's View After the Peripatetic philosophers, Mulla Sadra with his foundations of the Transcendental Wisdom , provided a different account of the bodily resurrection . He maintained that though the resurrection is in fact bodily and what is resurrected is the combination of one's body and the soul, the body resurrected in the Dooms Day is a delicate body which is exactly similar to (though not identical with) one's this-worldly body, but it has the disposition or potentiality for the afterlife . These changes in the position, magnitude and the shape of one's body do not threaten one's personal identity or persistence through time, since persons are individuated by their souls and not their bodies. This is why the person in the afterlife is judged to be the same person in this world, though his or her apparent features might have changed. So if the soul survives, the changes or transformations in the matter will not be important. Differences between Afterlife Bodies and This-Worldly Bodies Mulla Sadra enumerates the differences between afterlife bodies and this-worldly bodies as follows: Afterlife bodies cannot be corrupted, unlike this-worldly bodies. [6] Afterlife bodies have a spirit and life—in fact, they are identical with life, that is, their lives are essential, rather than accidental, to them, but some this-worldly bodies have life and some lack it. [7] Afterlife bodies are infinite as to the number of the conceptions and perceptions of their souls, since the arguments for the finitude of the dimensions do not apply to them. [8] Afterlife bodies are intermediate between the two worlds—they combine spirituality and corporeality, and they lack most features and properties of this-worldly bodies. [9] Afterlife bodies do not spatially prevent one another. [10] This-worldly bodies emerge gradually, but afterlife bodies emerge abruptly.

{"title": "Tawhid", "text": "Tawḥīd (Arabic: التَوحيد ), or monotheism is the most fundamental doctrine in Islam , which means believing in the oneness and uniqueness of God and not ascribing any partners to Him. The message of the Prophet Muhammad (s) since the beginning of his mission was based on the call for tawhid and the rejection of polytheism . Tawhid is a major theme in the Qur'an and hadiths . Al-Tawhid is also one of the names of sura 112 of the Qur'an, which presents a brief but deep expression of the doctrine. In Islam, tawhid stands in contrast to shirk (ascribing partners to God). Muslim theologians have counted a number of levels for tawhid: al-tawhid al-dhati (unity of the divine essence), which refers to the belief in God as the only God and negating any partners for Him; al-tawhid al-sifati (unity of the divine attributes), which refers to the identity of divine essence with divine attributes; al-tawhid al-af'ali (unity of actions), which refers to the fact that God is the only independent cause and that He needs no assistance for His actions; al-tawhid al-'ibadi (unity of worship), which refers to the fact that no one other than God deserves to be worshiped . There are various arguments for tawhid in the Qur'an, hadiths, and the works of Muslim philosophers and theologians. The argument of tamanu' (Argument of Antagonism), the argument from appointing prophets , and the Argument of the Impossibility of Multiplicity are some of the arguments presented by Muslim theologians and philosophers for tawhid. Some Sunnis, including Ibn Taymiyya , Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab , and 'Abd al-'Aziz Bin Baz, have regarded asking for shafa'a and tawassul as instances of shirk. Based on the teachings of the Qur'an, other Muslims reject this idea and maintain that there is no problem in asking for intercession when the intercessor is not considered divine and asking for intercession is done just to honor the intercessor and get closer to God through them. Shiite scholars have written extensively on the topic of tawhid. Some of their works are devoted exclusively to tawhid, and others are parts of works on theology. Some of these books are al-Tawhid by al-Shaykh al-Saduq , Gowhar-i murad by 'Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji , al-Rasa'il al-tawhidiyya by Allama Tabatabai , and Tawhid by Morteza Motahhari . Meaning Tawhid, in the sense of believing in the oneness of God, is the most fundamental Islamic doctrine, according to which the One God is the sole creator of the world and does not have any partners. Tawhid is also used, as seen in some hadiths, to mean confessing this doctrine. Sometimes the term tawhid refers to the theological discussions related to God, His attributes, and actions. According to hadiths , the Prophet (s) used the word to mean the affirmation of the proposition \"lā ilāh illā Allāh, waḥdah lā sharīk lah\" ( لا إله إلا ألله، وحده لاشريک له , there is no god except Allah, he is one and has no partner). In response to questions about tawhid, Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) have brought up some theological discussions such as negating human attributes from God. There are three different types of tawhid, Theological tawhid, which refers to the belief in the oneness of God based on theological arguments; Philosophical tawhid, which is the belief in the oneness of God based on purely rational arguments; Mystical tawhid, which goes beyond concepts and refers to witnessing the One [4] Being from whom all beings originate. In Mulla Sadra's Transcendental Philosophy , all these types of Tawhid are combined and mystical experiences have been juxtaposed with intellectual arguments. Place in Islam Tawhid is regarded as the most important characteristic teaching of Islam. As the Qur'an stipulates, all the prophets (a) called people to tawhid. Although the term \"tawhid\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an, there are many Qur'anic verses that are related to the affirmation of tawhid and negation of polytheism, such that the main purpose of the Qur'an is considered by Mulla Sadra in his exegesis to be the affirmation of tawhid. Confessing tawhid and rejecting polytheism are among the first teachings of the Prophet (s), which he proclaimed at the beginning of his mission in Mecca . The representatives that the Prophet (s) sent to various places, such as Mu'adh b. Jabal , would first and foremost call people to tawhid. Imam Ali (a) states that believing in the oneness of God is the foundation of knowing God. Tawhid is emphasized in the Qur'an in various words and expressions. Negating other gods, emphasizing the oneness of God for all, condemning polytheists, rejecting the Trinity, and negating anything that is similar to God are among the themes related to tawhid in the Qur'an. Some of the Qur'anic verses about tawhid are, Say, 'He is Allah, the One'. ( Qur'an 112 :1) There is no god except Allah. ( Qur'an 37 :35, Qur'an 47 :19) Your god is the One God, there is no god except Him. ( Qur'an 2 :163) Your God is the One God. ( Qur'an 18 :110, Qur'an 21 :108, Qur'an 41 :6) There is no god except Allah, the One. ( Qur'an 38 :65) Levels In accordance with the Qur'an and the sayings of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) , many theologians, philosophers, and mystics have counted several levels for tawhid: Al-Tawhid al-dhati (unity of the essence), Al-Tawhid al-sifati (unity of the attributes), Al-Tawhid al-af'ali (unity of actions), Al-Tawhid al-'ibadi (unity of worship). [13] In Islam, tawhid is in contrast with shirk (ascribing partners to God), and thus eliminating shirk is one of the main themes and aims of the Qur'an. Just as different levels have been mentioned for tawhid, shirk also is considered to have different levels: al-shirk al-dhati is the belief in more than one God; al-shirk al-af'ali is the belief in more than one independent cause in the world; al-shirk al-sifati is the belief in the ontological multiplicity of God's attributes and their distinction from His essence, and al-shirk al-'ibadi is worshipping something other than the one God. Unity of the Essense Unity of the essence is the first stage of monotheism, consisting in the belief in the oneness of divine essence. That is, the divine essence is not subject to plurality and has no peer. In the terminologies of theology and philosophy , Unity of essence has two meanings: God is one, it has no peer, and it is inconceivable for Him to have a second. The divine essence is simple, in the sense of not being composed of parts. [21] Qur'an 112 (Sura al-Tawhid), refers to both kinds of Unity of essense: the word 'Aḥad' at the beginning of this sura refers to the simplicity of divine essence, and the last verse ('there is none like unto Him') refers to the rejection of any peers and partners about God. Unity of the Attributes Unity of the attributes is the view that the divine essence is identical with divine attributes. Thus, the divine knowledge is not distinct from divine power; all His being is both knowledge, power, and other attributes through and through, and all His attributes are identical to one another and to his essence. Contrary to other beings, in which attributes are distinct from their essence, and they gain the attributes. Qur'an has cleared God from the attributes. In a speech narrated by Abu Basir , Imam al-Sadiq (a) attributes divine knowledge, hearing, sight and power to divine essence and has stipulated that God has been able to hear and see before there had been anything to be heard or seen. Unity of Actions Unity of actions (al-tawhid al-af'ali) is the view that in order to do His acts, God does not need anything or anyone other than His own essence—He is independent in all His acts. According to the unity of actions, nothing in the world can have any effects or do anything except in virtue of the power it is given by God; all actions, movements, and effects are originated in His essence. He has no partners in His essence, He has no partners in His agency—including creation, monitoring, owning, and governing the world. Qur'an introduces God as the creator of everything and the one, all paramount. Imam al-Sadiq (a) has considered God as the only one who can create something from nothing. Unity of Worship Unity of worship is a sort of theoretical monotheism, which amounts to the thought that nothing except Allah is worthy of worshiping—that is, there is no god except Allah. Therefore, every person has to worship God and on the basis of His commands. According to Qur'an inviting to worship the One God is the primary mission of all of the prophets . Monotheism in worship has been referred to by some Qur'anic verses, such as Qur'an 6:102, Qur'an 1 :2-5, Qur'an 21 :25. This is taken to be implied by other types of monotheism: if our existence is from Allah, our survival depends on Him, the only truly independent cause in the world is Allah, and it is only Allah who has the right to command and legislate, then no one else is worthy of worship. Any non-divine motivations involving in worships reduces their value and it sometimes leads to their religious invalidity. Arguments In the Qur'an and hadiths and in the works of Muslim philosophers and theologians, a number of arguments have been mentioned for tawhid. Some of these arguments are as follows: Argument of Tamanu' (mutual exclusion), which is based on Qur'an 21 :22 [34] , seeks to demonstrate tawhid by refuting shirk. [35] This argument has been formulated in the following way: If there were two gods and one of them willed to do something and the other willed to do its opposite, one of the following would happen: Argument of Multiplicity is among the arguments set forth in Islamic philosophy for the oneness of God. According to this argument, if there were more than one god (or necessary existent), each of them would have a common aspect with the other gods—as they all are necessary existents—and an exclusive aspect. This means that each god is combined of a common aspect and an exclusive aspect. However, this is impossible, because a necessary existent cannot be a compound being, as every compound being is in need of its parts, and therefore its existence is not necessary by itself. Therefore, there is only one necessary existent. [37] Other arguments have also been presented by Muslim theologians and philosophers for the oneness of God, such as the Argument of Specificity (ta'ayyun), the Argument of the Impossibility of Multiplicity , the Argument of the Multiplicity of the Objects of Power , and the Argument from Appointing the Prophets . The latter is taken from Imam Ali's (a) letter to his son Imam al-Hasan (a) , in which it is stated that if God had any partners, they would send their prophets to people. Accusations Against the Shi'a Wahhabis regard the Shiite practice of asking the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) for intercession and seeking the blessings of their graves and relics as shirk. However, the Shi'a reject this accusation and believe that those who do so never intend to worship these friends of God and do not believe in their divinity. Their intention is only to honor those righteous servants of God and to get closer to God by honoring them. According to Ibn Taymiyya , whoever asks Imam Ali (a) for intercession is an infidel and whoever doubts the infidelity of such a person is also an infidel . Moreover, he maintained that whoever visits the grave of the Propeht (s) or anyone else and asks them for something is a polytheist , who must be required to repent or be killed if he refuses to repent. Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz, the contemporary Wahhabi mufti, also considered asking the dead for healing or victory over the enemies as instances of the greater shirk. Based on the Qur'an , the Shia reject the act of asking for intercession only if the one who is asked for intercession is considered as acting independently of God and His permission. It is this case that is an instance of the greater shirk in the lordship of God. In response to Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab and his followers who adduce the Qur'anic verses that criticize polytheists for seeking the intercession of their gods, Shiite scholars point to the fundamental difference between their action and the Shiite practice of asking the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) for intercession, which is the fact that, unlike the polytheists, Shiites do not believe in the divinity of the Prophet (s) or the Imams (a) and do not regard them as independent agents of intercession. Bibliography Shiite scholars have authored many works related to the topic of tawhid. These works include the ones that are exclusively on the topic of tawhid and the ones that discuss this topic along other beliefs and doctrines. Some of these works are as follows: Kitab al-Tawhid by al-Shaykh al-Saduq , which is basically a collection of hadiths related to the oneness of God, His attributes , free will and predestination , and so forth. Sharh bab hadi 'ashar by Miqdad b. 'Abd Allah al-Suyuri about the principles of Shiite beliefs. Its first chapter concerns monotheism. [47] The book Bab hadi 'ashar was written by al-'Allama al-Hilli . [48] Al-Rasa'il al-tawhidiyya by Allama Tabatabai , which includes four major parts: the oneness of God, divine names and attributes, intermediaries, and the material world. Tawhid , a transcription of 17 lectures by Morteza Motahhari , delivered in 1967-8, [49] in 346 pages. The book largely consists of replies to objections about the relation between monotheism and the theory of evolution as well as the problem of evil. [50] Al-Tawhid wa-l-shirk fi l-Qur'an al-karim by Ja'far Subhani . In the four chapters of this book, the author begins with a statement of seven degrees of monotheism and a definition of worships , and then addresses Wahhabi beliefs and their criteria for monotheism and polytheism . Ayatullah Subhani published another book titled Buhuth Qur'aniyya fi l-tawhid wa-l-shirk in Arabic, which also concerns monotheism, polytheism, and Wahhabi objections. A chief part of the book (three out of five chapters) is about monotheism in worship .

[52] In this book, Ahmad 'Abidi provides an account of oneness in divinity, oneness in lordship, and oneness of names and attributes, and finally the faith and its tenets from a Shiite perspective, and in arguing for the advantage of Shiite beliefs over Wahhabi beliefs concerning monotheism, the author criticizes Nasir al-Qafari’s approach.

{"title": "Za'far Jinni", "text": "Za'far Jinni (Arabic: زَعْفَر جِنّی ) or Ja'far Jinni (Arabic: جعفر جِنّی ) was, as some believe, the head of jinns present in the event of 'Ashura . According to some reports, he offered assistance to Imam al-Husayn (a) , but he (a) did not accept. The story of Za'far Jinni and his presence in Karbala is among controversial issues in the history of 'Ashura , about which there is no mention in authentic Shi'a sources. In Rawdat al-shuhada' , Mulla Husayn Wa'iz Kashifi mentioned a comprehensive story; but on the opposite, Murtada Mutahhari considered it among distortions in the event of 'Ashura and a result of Kashifi's fiction. In the folklore of some regions in Iran , Za'far Jinni is mentioned and is displayed in ceremonies such as ta'ziya . There are also illustrations of the presence of Za'far Jinni in Karbala, one of which is the tile-work of Kermanshah's Tekyeh Mu'aven al-mulk. In Shi'a Sources The story of Za'far Jinni in the event of 'Ashura is not mentioned in any authentic Shi'a or Islamic history sources. The only available report about Imam al-Husayn (a) and jinns is al-Majlisi 's report in Bihar al-anwar quoting from al-Shaykh al-Mufid who transmitted it from Imam al-Sadiq (a) mentioning the meeting of some angels and jinns with Imam al-Husayn (a) upon exiting Medina . It narrates that they offered to help Imam (a), but he (a) did not accept. However, no names of any certain time or place is mentioned. Some researchers including Mirza Husayn Nuri and Morteza Motahhari regarded the story of Za'far Jinni among superstitions and distortions entered in the history of 'Ashura. Rawdat al-shuhada' mentioned Za'far Jinni and described his appearance. It also mentions his presence in Karbala and the rejection of his offer of assistance by Imam al-Husayn (a). Thus, the author of this book is considered the first reporter and the creator of this story. Relation with Ayatollah Burujirdi Among people, many stories have been spread about the relation between Ayatullah Burujirdi and Za'far Jinni. Especially different stories are mentioned about the death of Za'far and holding Funeral Procession for him by this Shi'a marja' . According to researches, such stories have no certain origin and there is nothing mentioned about it in the books and memories related to the biography of Ayatullah Burujirdi. Since there are not any authentic proofs about the relation between Ayatullah Burujirdi and Za'far, it seems that in laypeople's reports, a mistake has been made between this famous marja' and an author with a similar name. Sayyid Ali Asghar Shafi' Jabolqi Borujerdi (d. 1313 SH/1934-5) who was among the scholars of Borujerd and the author of Tara'if al-maqal , mentioned Za'far Jinni in his book and reported the story of the presence of Za'far Jinni in Karbala from one of his teachers, he regarded as reliable. It seems that the similarity between the names of Sayyid Ali Asghar Jabolqi Borujirdi and Ayatullah Burujirdi misled reporters to attribute approvals of the stories of Za'far Jinni to this Shi'a marja'.

{"title": "Barzakh", "text": " Barzakh (Arabic: بَرزَخ ) is a world between this world and hereafter ; it is also called the imaginal world or the world of grave . Brazakh exists for both believers and non-believers, though it is similar to the Heaven for the former, and similar to the Hell for non-believers. Meaning 'Barzakh' in Arabic literally means an interval or a barrier between two things, and technically it means an interval between the end of this-worldly life (death) and the beginning of hereafter. The world is called 'Barzakh' because it is an interval between this world and the hereafter. The world is also called the world of grave and the imaginal world. In the Qur'an The word 'Barzakh' has been mentioned three times in the Qur'an . but only in Qur'an 23 :100 it has been used in the meaning in question: “ حَتَّى إِذَا جَاء أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ (۹۹) لَعَلِّی أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِیمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلَّا إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَائِهِم بَرْزَخٌ إِلَى یوْمِ یبْعَثُونَ \"When death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord! Take me back (99) that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.' 'By no means! These are mere words that he says.' And ahead of them is a Barzakh until the day they will be resurrected.\" ” — Qur'an, Qur'an 23:99-100 According to this verse of the Qur'an, the request of some people at the time of their death to return to the world in order to do the good deeds that they have not done is not in place, and they face a barrier or an interval—a Barzakh—until the Day of Judgment . The phrase \"until the day they will be resurrected\" indicates that Barzakh is an interval between this world and the hereafter, that anyone experiences after their death and before the Day of Judgment. Proof in the Qur'an In addition to verse 100 of Qur'an 23 that explicitly shows the existence of Barzakh, some verses prove Barzakh without mentioning the word 'Barzakh'. These verses concern the life of martyrs after their deaths: And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their lord. [5] And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, (they are) alive, but you do not perceive. [6] Moreover, according to Qur'anic verses, Barzakh is not restricted to martyrs—a sinner like Pharaoh and his friends also experience Barzakh: In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the day that judgment will be established: 'cast ye the people of pharaoh into the severest penalty! ( Qur'an 23 :46) [7] The verse obviously points to a penalty for Pharaoh and his people before the penalties of the Day of Judgment, and that is the penalty in Barzakh. In Hadiths Definition In some hadiths , the word 'Barzakh' is used to mean an interval between this world and the hereafter. For instance, according a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) , all (true) Shiites will go to the Heaven in the hereafter, and, the hadith goes on, 'I swear to God that I fear about you in Barzakh'. A person asked him about Barzakh, and Imam answered: '[it is] the grave, from one's death to the Day of Judgment'. This latter statement implies that the world of grave is the world of Barzakh —indeed, grave in this hadith does not mean a certain hole in the earth; it is a metaphor for Barzakh. Barzakh's Heaven and Hell Some hadiths state that the world of Barzakh has its own heaven and hell in which people are rewarded or punished for their deeds. The Prophet (s) says: \"the grave is either a garden of heaven or a hole of hell\". Question of the Grave A number of hadiths show that once people enter the world of Barzakh, they are questioned about their beliefs and deeds. This questioning is known as \"the question of the grave\". Barzakhi Body Human soul attaches to an imaginal or Barzakhi body. An imaginal body is one that is not of a material kind, and yet enjoys some characteristics of material objects, such as shape and size. In these respects, the imaginal body is like a person's natural body. In order to have a clear picture of an imaginal or Barzakhi body, one might reflect on the forms or images that one observes while dreaming. Such forms are undoubtedly non-material; they do not occupy any space and they do not have any mass, and yet they have a shape and a size and they have forms like those of material objects.

{"title": "Metamorphosis", "text": "Metamorphosis or Maskh (Arabic: مَسْخ ) is a kind of divine punishment in which one is transformed into an animal. In metamorphosis, the human identity is not lost, while its appearance changes into an animal figure. Some cases of metamorphosis are mentioned in Islamic sources, the best-known of which is the story of People of Sabbath . According to Qur'anic verses , People of Sabbath were people from the Children of Israel who defied God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays, and then, were transformed into monkeys. According to Islamic hadiths , metamorphosis occurs on the day of resurrection as well, when some sinners are transformed into animals such as monkeys and pigs. Some Quranic exegetes interpret the story as allegorical; that is, sins lead to animal temperaments. Such an interpretation is rejected by the majority of exegetes, however. They believe that appearances of the people in the story really changed. Definition of Metamorphosis and its Difference from Metempsychosis Metamorphosis is the transformation of something's appearances into something unpleasant. Metempsychosis is the attachment of the soul to another body after its separation from its own body. In metamorphosis, the soul is not separated from the body. Instead, the appearances of the body change and is transformed into an animal. Preservation of the Human Identity in Metamorphosis According to Muslim scholars, the transformation of human appearances does not amount to the change of his human nature. Thus, metamorphosis is not tantamount to the destruction of a human individual and creation of a monkey individual or the transmigration of a human soul into a monkey body. Instead, metamorphosis is the coincidence of two specific forms. That is to say, while the human specific form is still there, it has received a monkey specific form as well. Hence, the individual should be called a human monkey. Here is how Murteza Mutahhari explains the issue: \"in whatever way I am on the day of resurrection, whether I am with this body or with another body, I am one hundred percent the same person, although my appearances might have changed. Even if I undergo a metamorphosis on the day of resurrection in proportion to my psychological attitudes, and I am resurrected in an animal form, it is still me who has animal organs.\" Occurrence of Metamorphosis According to the Qur'an The Qur'an talks about the metamorphosis of some human beings. For example, the verse twenty of Qur'an 5 is about the transformation of some human beings into monkeys and pigs. Moreover, the verse sixty five of Qur'an 2 is about some people from among the Children of Israel , known as People of Sabbath , who were transformed into monkeys because they disobeyed God's prohibition of fishing on Saturdays. Metamorphosis of some Disciples According to some Quranic verses, the disciples of Jesus asked God to send them a table of foods from the sky. When God sent them the table, He said: \"should any of you disbelieve after this, I will indeed punish him with a punishment such as I do not punish anyone in all creation.\" Some exegetes interpret the verse as follows: some disciples betrayed Jesus (a) despite the heavenly table, and then they were transformed into animals by God. Some other exegetes like 'Allama Tabataba'i have rejected this interpretation, taking it to be in conflict with other Quranic verses. How the Quranic Metamorphosis Occurred There are different accounts of how metamorphosis occurs in this world. The majority of Quranic exegetes believe that metamorphosis or maskh in the Qur'an is the transformation of the human body into another animal. Some others believe, nevertheless, that metamorphosis merely occurs in one's inner self, and human face or appearance does not change. Mujahid b. Jubayr (d. 102/720-1) says: \"the metamorphosis mentioned in the Qur'an is an analogy just like ‘the example of an ass carrying books’.\" 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashani said: the metamorphosis occurred merely in people's inner selves. In other words, the Jews who underwent metamorphosis were just like other people in their outer forms, although they were not humans in their inner selves. The same view is held by Rashid Rida and Muhammad Abduh . Notwithstanding this, the majority of Quranic exegetes believe that the metamorphosis in the Qur'an is used literally. That is, it really occurred in people's bodies and their appearances did change. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , there are mutawatir hadiths to the same effect. As to the objection that this kind of metamorphosis is improbable, advocates of the latter view argue that if we accept miracles by prophets , then the extraordinary character of an action cannot be evidence for its impossibility. Instead, this is a condition of miracles. Metamorphosis of Human Beings in Resurrection According to some hadiths, some people will be resurrected in animal forms. For example, Ma'adh b. Jabal asked the Prophet (s) about the Quranic verse, \"the day the Trumpet will be blown , and you will come in groups.\" The Prophet (s) said: some of them will be resurrected in the form of monkeys, some in the form of pigs, and so on.” According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) : \"those who deny the divine destination will be resurrected from their graves in the form of monkeys and pigs.\" Metamorphosis of the Soul Some Muslim scholars believe that human beings might undergo metamorphosis in their souls and thus they might spiritually turn into animals. Some Quranic exegetes maintain that the Quranic verse, \"they are just like cattle; indeed, they are more astray,\" is a reference to this fact. According to Murteza Mutahhari , a man's humanity depends on his moral characteristics, and if he gains the characteristics of a savage animal, then he has indeed undergone metamorphosis.\" Other Examples of Metamorphosis In some Shiite and Sunni sources, there are reports of metamorphosis of people other than those mentioned in the Qur'an. For example, there is a hadith cited in al-Khisal by al-Shaykh al-Saduq according to which thirteen animal species, including scorpions, bats, and bears, were original human beings who then underwent metamorphosis. Moreover, al-Tabarani, a Sunni scholar in third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, quoted the Prophet (s) as saying that some Muslims will undergo metamorphosis and turn into monkeys and pigs. The Fate of Metamorphosed People According to hadiths, people whose metamorphosis story is mentioned in the Qur'an survived just for three days, and they had no progenies. Sadr al-Muti'allihin says: \"Muslims have consensus over the fact that today's animals are not progenies of metamorphosed human beings, since these people died after three days without producing children during their animal period.\" See Also People of the Sabbath Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related"}
{"title": "Day of Encounter", "text": "Day of Encounter or Yawm al-Talāq (Arabic: یَوْم التَّلاق ) is a term referring to the day of resurrection . The term is used once in the Qur'an , and different interpretations have been provided for what is meant thereby. In the Qur'an The term is used once in the Qur'an in Sura al-Ghafir verse 15: “ رَفِيعُ الدَّرَجَاتِ ذُو الْعَرْشِ يُلْقِي الرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ لِيُنذِرَ يَوْمَ التَّلَاقِ \"Raiser of ranks, Lord of the Throne, He casts the Spirit of His command upon whomever of His servants that He wishes, that he may warn [people] of the Day of Encounter.\" ” — Qur'an, 40:15. Meaning of \"Talaq\" \"Talaq\" literally means an encounter or meeting. Different interpretations have been proposed for \"talaq\" in the above verse: There is a hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) according to which \"Yawm al-Talaq\" is a day in which inhabitants of the sky and the Earth will meet. [2] Al-Shaykh al-Mufid takes \"Yawm al-Talaq\" to mean the meeting of the soul and the body on the day of resurrection. It seems that he has the physical resurrection in mind. [3] It means the meeting of all people from the past to the last nations, [4] as another verse of the Qur'an reads: \"Indeed, the former and the later peoples * Are to be gathered together for the appointment of a known Day\".

{"title": "Day of Separation", "text": "Day of Separation or Yawm al-Faṣl (Arabic: یَوْم الفَصْل ) is a term in the Qur'an referring to the Day of Judgement . Exegetes of the Qur'an maintain that the Day of Judgement is referred to as such because it is on this day that the truth and falsehood will be separated. Meaning \"Al-Fasl\" literally means to \"cut off\" or \"separate\" in a way that a distance is created there between. In the Qur'an The term, \"Yawm al-Fasl\", is used in the Qur'an to refer to the Day of Judgement mainly for the purpose of reprehending and threatening polytheists or deniers. According to the Quran 37 :21 [2] and in Qur'an 44 :40 [3] , it is used to threaten the polytheists, and in its subsequent verses, the meaning of separation (al-fasl) is explained as follows: “ The day when a friend will not avail a friend in any way, nor will they be helped, except for him on whom Allah has mercy. Indeed He is the All-mighty, the All-merciful. ” — Qur'an 44 :41-42 In Qur'an 77 , the term, Yawm al-Fasl, has been used three times to refer to the Day of Judgement. In verses thirteen and fourteen, the greatness of the Day is characterized as follows: “ For what day has [all] that been set [to occur]? For the Yawm al-Fasl! And what will show you what is the Yawm al-Fasl!? Woe to the deniers on that day! ” — Qur'an 77 :12-14) And in Qur'an 78 :17, the Yawm al-Fasl is characterized as an appointed time in which all peoples are assembled [4] Interpretation 'Allama Tabataba'i holds that Yawm al-Fasl refers to the Day of Judgement because, according to the verse seventeen of Qur'an 22 , it separates people. And the Day of Judgement is called Yawm al-Fasl because it is on this day that the truth is separated from the falsehood and pious people are separated from sinners . He takes the verse fifty nine of Qur'an 36 , \"And Get apart today, you guilty ones!\", to be evidence for his interpretation . According to Tafsir-i nimuna , Yawm al-Fasl means the Day of Judgment in which God will adjudicate His servants. In this world, truths and falsehoods are intertwined, but on the Day of Judgement, they will be separated and the secrets will be revealed. Morteza Motahhari interprets Yawm al-Fasl as follows: \"Human beings form communities in this world on the basis of their appearances, but in the Day of Judgement, the reign is grounded in people's interiors and internal habits. In the afterlife , an angel -like person will not be able to communicate with evil people. Thus, there will be a separation between them. People will be resurrected with their leaders in flocks, with some of them having a leader in the Hell and some others having a leader in the Heaven .

{"title": "Hanif Religion", "text": "Ḥanīf religion (Arabic: الدین الحنیف ), meaning a religion which conforms to human fitra or nature, refers to the religion propagated by all prophets from Adam (a) to the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Being \"hanif\" is a feature of the divine religion which is straight and without any deviations. And specifically, it is a characteristic of Ibrahim 's (a) religion. Literal Meaning The word \"hanif\" ( حنیف ) means to incline or to lean. It is a noun whose meaning is completed by a complementary noun. So \"hanif\" means something that inclines; and someone whose fingers are inclined outwards or whose legs are inclined is called \"aḥnaf\" (Arabic: أحنف ). However, some people hold that \"hanif\" means straight and direct. Thus in fact a person whose legs are straight is called \"ahnaf\", but a person whose legs are inclined is only called \"ahnaf\" for its good fortune, just as in Arabic a person who is sick is called healthy, because of the good fortune. Terminological Meaning The word \"hanif\" has various terminological senses because of its different uses in the exegesis of the Quran , the discipline of hadith , and the Arabic history in the Age of Ignorance ( Jahiliyya ). Religion of Ibrahim (a) During the Jahiliyya period, those who believed in the religion of Ibrahim (a) were called \"hanif\". Some Quranic verses point to such a usage: “ Ibrahim was not a Jew nor a Christian but he was hanif, a Muslim, and he was not one of the polytheists ” — Qur'an 3 :67 “ And who has a better religion than he who submits himself entirely to Allah? And he is the doer of good and follows the faith of Ibrahim, the hanif (upright) one, and Allah took Ibrahim as a friend. ” — Qur'an 4 :125 The hanif religion was both a religious and reformist movement whose propagators were characterized as followers of Ibrahim (a)'s religion. Hanif people were skeptical of polytheism and idolatry ; they went to caves for worships and reflections, and they called people to Ibrahim (a)'s old religion. These thoughts were influential in undermining the foundations of idolatry in the Arabian Peninsula and led to people's self-consciousness. Thus opposition to idols had already started before the emergence of Islam. Customs of Some Arabs The \"hanif religion\" is also used to refer to customs of some Arabs in the Jahiliyya period, which consisted of some practices that were remnants of Ibrahim (a) 's religion. It included practices such as hajj rituals, circumcision of boys, and janaba ghusl (ritual bath after impurity caused by sexual intercourse or seminal discharge). As a Title for Polytheists Jews and Christians used to call polytheists as \"hanifs\", and thus they used the word to refer to idolatry. Conversion to the Right Religion Some people take \"hanif\" to refer to a person who converts from a wrong religion to the right religion. This terminology is derived from the literal meaning of the word and has been made by some scholars of the Quranic exegesis. A Muslim On another terminology, \"hanif\" means Muslim (a person who submits himself or herself to God ), as indicated by the holy Quran in the aforementioned verse ( 3 :67). Imam al-Sadiq (a) said: \"To be hanif is to be a Muslim (a person who submits to God)\". and Imam al-Baqir (a) said: \"Al-Qanit means obedient and al-hanif means Muslim\". It must be noted that \"Islam\" has two meanings: it literally means submission and surrender, and it terminologically refers to the specific religion emerged after the revelation of the Qur'an . Sometimes prophets before Muhammad (s) are called Muslims or followers of Islam, which is meant to be in the literal sense of the term. Divine Religion \"Hanif\" is sometimes used as a feature of the divine religion that all prophets are obligated by God to propagate. This religion is called \"Islam\", that is, submission to God. According to the Quran: “ the only religion before Allah is submission (Islam). ” — Qur'an 3 :19 This is characterized as hanif because it conforms to people's fitra or nature. This is why Ibrahim (a) 's religion is also characterized as hanif. 18 According to the holy Quran: “ and that you should keep your face towards the religion in a hanif way (uprightly); and you should not be of the polytheists. ” — Qur'an 10 :105 In sources of hadith , the Prophet (s) is reported to have said that \"Allah has ordered that I call to his hanif religion\". In the Qur'an The word \"hanif\" has occurred 10 times in the Qur'an, and its plural form, \"hunafa'\" (Arabic: حنفاء ) has occurred two times. Two out of its ten occurrences characterize the religion, five of them characterize the Ibrahim (a)'s religion or path, asking people to follow his religion because it was close (or \"inclined\") to the right religion. And there are two occurrences of the word characterizing Ibrahim (a) himself; one of them occurs in the above verse (Qur'an 3:67), and the other one occurs in the verse: “ surely Ibrahim was an exemplar, obedient to Allah, hanif (upright), and he was not of the polytheists. ” — Qur'an 16 :120 The uses of the word \"hanif\" in the holy Quran imply monotheism that is apprehended by fitra and the outlook of prophets, particularly Ibrahim (a), and that it is contrary to polytheism. The verses ( Quran 6 :79, Quran 30 :30 and others) show that there is a connection between being hanif and fitra (that is, instinctive grasp of the creator of the world). Some verses ( Quran 2 :135 and Quran 3 :67) imply two issues: To be a hanif is neither to be a Jew, nor to be a Christian. It amounts to being a Muslim (in the literal sense, that is, submission to God). In Hadiths The word \"hanif\" and its cognates are very much used in hadiths , with its origin considered to be fitra or the nature on which God has created people. The most significant use of \"hanif\" in hadiths is its application to a set of guidelines regarding health issues revealed by God to Ibrahim (a) , some of which were practiced by a few Arabs during the Jahiliyya period. These traditions were revived by the Prophet Muhammad (s).

{"title": "Al-Mahdawiyya", "text": "Al-Mahdawīyya (Arabic: المهدوية ) is the doctrine about the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , the twelfth infallible Imam from the progeny of the Prophet (s) . The belief in a savior who establishes justice and removes injustice in the world is an essential doctrine for Shiite Muslims and is a belief held by all Muslims. In Shiite doctrines, this promised savior has also been called al-Qa'im (person who rises) from the family of Muhammad (s). According to hadiths , the Prophet (s) predicted that a man from his household , called \" al-Mahdi \" (the guided one), will appear and fills the earth with justice, as it was filled with injustice. Thus after the demise of the Prophet (s) , Muslims always expected the appearance of al-Mahdi (a).

{"title": "Islam", "text": "Islām (Arabic: الإسلام ) is among monotheistic and Abrahamic religions . The prophet of this religion is Muhammad (s) to whom the Qur'an was revealed. The beginning invitation to Islam was made in 610 CE in the city of Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula . The increasing expansion of Islam began after emigration of the Prophet (s) to Medina . Muslims believe that the Holy Prophet (s) is the last divine prophet and Islam is the last divine religion. The Qur'an and tradition of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) are the most essential sources to learn about Islamic beliefs and practices. Muslims believe that there is no falsehood or error in the Qur'an and it has remained unaltered since its revelation. Tradition includes the speeches and acts of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) transmitted to us in written form from one generation to another. The most important ideological principles in Islam are monotheism , prophethood of the Prophet of Islam (s) and the resurrection . The most important practices in Islam are daily prayers , fasting , khums , zakat , hajj , and jihad . A great part of Islamic sources deals with the introduction of good and bad qualities and practical ways to acquire moral perfection. Advising people's rights and orders for the regulation of social and family relationships are among the moral teachings of Islam. For many issues in daily life, Islam has regulations for different issues such as marriage , divorce , buying and sale, lease and judgment, the rulings for which are discussed in the books of jurisprudence under the title of transactions . There are two major schools of Shi'a and Sunni in Islam, each of which has different branches. The major difference between the two is over the issue of imamate or caliphate after the Prophet (s); however, they have differences over some other ideological issues and rulings as well. Today, Muslims live in most countries of the world. Their population is around 1.5 billion people. Majority of the Muslims live in Asia, especially in the Middle East. Terminology The word \"Islam\" has been used to mean \"submission, total unconditional obedience, acceptance of divine ruling and sincerity in worship.\" Among Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula in the pre-Islamic era, the term only had the meaning of \"abandoning and giving up something\" and Arabs used the verb \"aslam-a\" when a person gave up something very dear and precious and left it to someone else who wanted it; and if that thing is the person's own self, which is the most precious thing human possesses; then, \"Islam\" means \"total unconditional obedience and submission.\" According to Seyyed Hossein Nasr , \"A Muslim is one who has chosen to submit one's will to divine will.\" According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , the reason for naming this religion as Islam is that in this religion, the servant is submitted to the will of God, the Glorified. The word \"Islam\" has been used in the Qur'an. According to some verses, no religion other than Islam is accepted, and after the Prophet (s) brought Islam, the only religion valid before God is Islam. Many hadiths have been transmitted from the Prophet (s) in which he (s) called his religion Islam and called his followers \"Muslim\". In the categorization of religions, Islam is a divine, monotheistic and Abrahamic religion. Muslims believe in the One God. The Prophet of Islam (s) is Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah (s) who was sent by God to deliver the divine message (or the revelation) to people. The Qur'an contains the divine revelation sent to Prophet Muhammad (s). Difference between Islam and Faith See also Faith Anyone who says the two shahadatayn phrases, \"Ashhad-u an la ilah-a illa Allah\" [\"I give testimony that there is no god but Allah\"] and \"Ashhad-u ann-a Muhammad-an rasul Allah\" [\"I give testimony that Muhammad (s) is the Messenger of Allah\"] enters the religion of Islam. Saying these sentences is in fact giving testimony to the Oneness of God and the mission of the Prophet of Islam (s); without saying which, the person is outside Islam and is considered a disbeliever. This definition of Muslim is a basic level explanation of accepting Islam. At this level, it is even possible that there would be difference between what one says and what is in one's heart because accepting Islam is a basic and apparent step in accepting the Prophet's (s) religion by saying shahadatayn, but faith requires Shahadatayn as well as heartfelt and spiritual belief. Accepting Islam includes expressing submission and obedience by the tongue and also by the limbs whether it is followed by the heart or not, but faith includes submission together with heartfelt belief. The Prophet (s) The founder of Islam was Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Muttalib (s). Based on Islamic sources, he (s) was the last messenger of God sent to humans. Muslims regard him as the best of humans and the best role model for life. Many Muslims believe that Prophet Muhammad (s) was infallible and had the knowledge of the unseen . He (s) was Arab, born in 570 CE in Quraysh tribe who lived in Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula. In early childhood, he (s) lost his parents and was raised under the guardianship of his grandfather, 'Abd al-Muttalib , and after his demise, under the guardianship of his uncle, Abu Talib . During his lifetime, he (s) never followed idol-worshipping which was common in Mecca. The people of Mecca knew him for his trustworthiness. At the age of forty, God chose him as the Messenger ( Bi'tha ). The first message of God was sent to him then, by an angel Gabriel in the cave of Hira in Mecca. Divine Book The holy divine book of Muslims is the Qur'an which is the major source of their beliefs and practices. According to Islamic beliefs, the text of the Qur'an is divine revelation sent from Allah by the angel of revelation ( Gabriel ) to the Prophet (s). Muslims believe that there is no falsehood or error in the Qur'an and it has remained unaltered since its revelation (See: integrity of the Qur'an ). The Qur'an is a book in 114 chapters , each of which contains some verses . Sources The Qur'an, the tradition of the Prophet (s) and Imams of Shi'a (a) and also the speeches and acts of the Companions of the Prophet (s) are among the sources to which Muslims refer to learn about beliefs, practical duties, history of Islam and the lives of religious dignitaries. This tradition is acquired in the form of the books of hadiths and tradition from the past generations to the next generations. In the view of Shi'a , only the conduct of the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) is valid to acquire knowledge and practice. Relying on the conduct of the Companions is among the characteristics of Sunni people. Shi'a regard the conduct of companions as critical. Most important books of hadiths for Shi'a are the Four Books : al-Kafi written by al-Kulayni , Tahdhib al-ahkam and al-Istibsar written by al-Shaykh al-Tusi and Man la yahduruh al-faqih written by al-Shaykh al-Saduq . The most important books of hadiths for Sunni people are known as Sihah al-Sitta (the Six Correct Ones) which are: Sahih al-Bukhari , Sahih Muslim , Sunan al-Nasa'i , Sunan Ibn Maja , Sunan Ibn Dawud , and Sahih al-Tirmidhi . Principles of Religion Ideological principles are a set of beliefs including Islam's views towards the world, human being, nature, and their relations with God. The set of Islamic beliefs is contained in the three general principles of tawhid [oneness of God], nubuwwa [prophethood], and ma'ad [resurrection] which are called Usul al-Din [Principles of Religion], i.e. things which every Muslim needs to believe in. Other Islamic beliefs have roots in these three beliefs. Each of these beliefs makes Islam to be distinguished from other religions. In the Shi'a school of thought, Imamate is also considered among ideological principles. Islamic beliefs are in fact the manifestation of the Islamic worldview. Oneness of God In Islamic ideology, the most important belief is tawhid; i.e. believing in the One God. In Islamic beliefs, God is the Creator of all existence and its Sustainer. Believing in the Oneness of God is in three aspects of oneness in essence , oneness in attributes , and oneness in actions . These three aspects in fact form theoretical tawhid and are just present in the realm of a Muslim's beliefs. Practical tawhid is the result of theoretical tawhid and is manifested in branches such as tawhid in worship , tawhid in legislation , and tawhid in domination . Prophethood Muslims believe that God has chosen some people as messengers to send to humans. In Islamic literature, these people are called \"nabi\" [prophet] and \"rasul\" [messenger]. The number of divine prophets is a hundred and twenty-four thousand, five of whom are Ulu l-'Azm [literally: \"Having Will\"] and had certain duties. These prophets (a) brought religions and books. In the Qur'an, which is the last divine book, the names of twenty-six of the prophets (a) and the books of some of them are mentioned. The last divine prophet is Prophet Muhammad (s) who brought the religion of Islam and no divine prophet will come after him. (see: khatamiyya ) Imamate Imamate means leadership of people's affairs with regard to religion and the world in the place of the Prophet (s). In this regard, there are two major views among Muslims: Shi'a believe that the Prophet (s) announced his caliph by the order of God and people should obey him. This caliph was Ali b. Abi Talib (a) and after him, Imam al-Hasan (a) and then Imam al-Husayn (a) were Imams. Twelver Shi'a believe that after Imam al-Husayn (a), nine men of his progeny were Imam by the will of God. The Twelfth Imam was al-Mahdi (a) who is hidden from the public and will come to establish justice in the world. Some sects of Shi'a such as Zaydiyya , Isma'iliyya , and some others have different opinions about Imams after Imam al-Husayn (a). Sunnis believe that the Prophet (s) did not choose a caliph after himself; thus, after his demise, people chose Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa and gave allegiance to him. After him, they regarded 'Umar b. al-Khattab and then 'Uthman b. 'Affan the second and third caliphs and considered 'Ali b. Abi Talib (a) the fourth caliph. Resurrection Believing in the resurrection of the dead and the life after death is among the principles of beliefs among religions, especially Islam. Believing in the hereafter includes the belief in the events at the time of death and after it during the time in barzakh and also the event and situation after the resurrection on the Day of Resurrection . Concepts such as resurrection, mizan , tatayur al-kutub (distributing everyone's book [of actions]), and passing sirat bridge are among the issues Muslims believe. Other Beliefs Believing in angels , decree and destiny , the world of dhar , creation of Prophet Adam (a) from the soil, and the lineage of humans from him and Eve are among the beliefs of all or most Muslims. Practical Duties A great part of the teachings in Islam are about the actions of every Muslim. These duties which are called practical rulings are discussed in a science called jurisprudence . The original source to discover these duties is the Qur'an and tradition (speeches and acts of the Infallible Ones (a) ). In general, the practical duties of every Muslim can be categorized into three fields: worship, ethics, and society (transactions). Acts of Worship Worship is an act to be practiced with the intention of obeying the command of God. Acts of worship are either obligatory or recommended . The most important obligatory act of worship in Islam is daily prayers . Some of the most important obligatory acts of worship are: fasting in the month of Ramadan , zakat , khums , hajj , and jihad . Ethics There are many teachings regarding moral actions in original sources of Islam (the Qur'an and tradition of the Infallible Ones (a)). Introducing good and bad qualities and practical ways to achieve moral perfections, advising about the observation of people's rights, and orders for the regulation of social and family relations are among moral teachings in Islam. Civil and Social Duties In Islam, there are many rulings for many daily affairs; such as marriage , divorce , buying and selling, lease, foods and drinks , hunting , criminal issues, and judgment . These rulings are discussed in the science of jurisprudence under the title of transactions . Branches Today, Muslims are in two big branches of Shi'a and Sunni ; each one branching into several sects. The most important difference between Shia and Sunni is over the issue of Imamate or caliphate of the Prophet (s). This disagreement emerged among his companions during the first days after the demise of the Prophet (s). The differences between the two schools of thought are not limited to Imamate, as they also have differences in beliefs and practical rulings. Other differences of views between the two schools are their views toward the justice of the Companions of the Prophet (s), infallibility of Prophets (a), determination and free will , some rulings of wudu , daily prayers , and hajj and different views about temporary marriage . Shi'a Shi'a is one of the two major schools in Islam which has several branches. The common factor among all these sects is the belief in the Imamate and caliphate of Imam Ali (a) and his two sons, Imam al-Hasan (a) and Imam al-Husayn (a) after the Prophet (s). Shi'a Muslims live in most Islamic countries, but most of the Shi'a population (between 68% and 80%) live in four countries: Iran , Iraq , India , Pakistan . and in four countries, Iran, Azerbaijan , Bahrain and Iraq, Shia Muslims make up a majority of the total population. Sunnis Regarding population, Sunnis are more than Shi'a. Followers of this school have different branches as well; the divisions of which are based on two issues of jurisprudence and beliefs. Their differences in beliefs led to three schools of Mu'tazila , Ash'ari , and Maturidi ; and their differences in rulings and secondary principles of religion led to the formation of four schools of Hanafi , Maliki , Shafi'i , and Hanbali in jurisprudence . Khawarij The first divergence among Muslims that led to the formation of a faction was the divergence of Khawarij from the army of Imam Ali (a) in the Battle of Siffin . They had special ideas about the government and also those who had committed grave sins . Later, they were divided into several branches themselves and now live in countries such as Oman . History In Mecca Islam began in the city of Mecca in Arabian Peninsula in 610 CE, 40 years after the Year of Elephant when Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah (s) was chosen as the prophet of Islam (s). The first period of Islam was the thirteen years of the Prophet's (s) life and preaching in Mecca. In this period, the Prophet (s) secretly invited people for three years. After three years, God commanded him to invite his close relatives to Islam. (See: Yawm al-Dar ) In that period, few people accepted Islam. In years 12 and 13 after the beginning of his mission/620 and 621 CE, the Prophet (s) provided the grounds for emigration to Yathrib by making two treaties of Bay'at al-'Aqaba . In Medina In Rabi' al-Awwal , year 13 after the beginning of the mission, the Prophet (s) emigrated to Medina and with the people of Medina , established the first Islamic government. Companions of the Prophet (s) in Medina were in two big groups of Muhajirin [Emigrants] and Ansar [the Helpers]. The majority of the Helpers were from the two big tribes of Aws and Khazraj . In this period, the Prophet (s) was drawn to several battles which are recorded as Ghazwas and Sariyyas in the history. The most important Ghazwas of the Prophet (s) were the battles of Badr , Uhud , Khandaq and the Conquest of Mecca . After the Conquest of Mecca, almost all Arabian Peninsula became Muslim. In this period, the Prophet (s) wrote letters to the leaders of different countries and invited them to Islam. This period lasted ten years and Islam entered a new era after the demise of the Prophet (s). Period of the Three Caliphs After the demise of the Prophet (s) in 11/632 in Medina, disregarding his will about the caliphate of Ali b. Abi Talib (a) , some of his Companions chose Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafa as the caliph . After Abu Bakr, 'Umar b. al-Khattab and then 'Uthman b. 'Affan became caliph. During the caliphate of the First Caliph, some clashes with disbelievers and some battles with false prophets have been reported. During the caliphate of the Second Caliph which lasted about ten years, Islamic territory was expanded and Muslims took over Iran , Syria , Egypt , and other places. During the caliphate of the Third Caliph, Islamic territory continued to expand. The most important event of that period was the civil revolts which led to the murder of the Third Caliph and the election of Ali b. Abi Talib (a) as the Fourth Caliph. The Period of Imam Ali (a) and Imam al-Hasan (a) The period of Imam Ali's (a) government (35/656 – 40/661) lasted less than five years. Three internal battles of Jamal , Siffin , and Nahrawan were among the most important events of this period. Imam Ali (a) was assassinated by one of Khawarij in the mosque of Kufa and people gave allegiance to his elder son, Imam al-Hasan (a). The caliphate of Imam al-Hasan al-Mujtaba (a) lasted less than six months, most of which passed in the battle of Imam's (a) army with the army of Syria led by Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan . The battle ended by signing a peace treaty and leaving the caliphate to Mu'awiya. (See: peace treaty of Imam al-Hasan (a) ) Islam and Other Religions According to verses of the Qur'an and Islamic tradition, Muslims recognized the existence of some other religions inside the Islamic government, although they considered their beliefs to be wrong. Sabaeans, Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians are mentioned in the Qur'an. Since Muslims believed that these religions were based on divine books, their followers are called People of the Book . Based on Islamic rulings, these religious minorities need to pay a tax called jizya if they want to live in Islamic society. In religious texts, these minorities are also called dhimmi disbelievers or people of dhimma. Geography and Population of Muslims Today, Muslims live in most countries of the world. The population of Muslims in the world is around 1.5 billion people, most of them living in Asia and especially in the Middle East. The most populated Muslim country is Indonesia . Because of the two cities of Mecca and Medina and also holding the annual hajj ceremony, Arabia is considered among the important Muslim countries. Iraq is also one of the important Muslim countries and the graves of six Imams are placed in this country. One of the biggest and oldest seminaries of Shi'a is in the city of Najaf in Iraq.

{"title": "End Time", "text": " End Time or Akhir al-Zamān (Arabic: آخر الزمان ) is a religious title referring to the final period of the world which has been mentioned in all divine religions. In Islam , it has been mentioned either referring to a period of time related with the mission of the Prophet (s) , or referring to the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi . In common beliefs, End Time is known with extraordinary happenings. The most important characteristics of this period are the decline in people's religious practice and then the coming of a savior . The exact date of coming of the savior of the End Time is unknown and can only be determined with the ending period of time, which continues up to the Apocalypse and the end of the world. In the Qur'an The title \"Akhir al-Zaman\" ( آخر الزّمان ; End Time) is not mentioned in the Qur'an , but there are verses which are about the future of human society and suggest the government of monotheism and justice in the future of human life, inheriting the earth by righteous people and victory of the truth over falsehood. In Hadiths The expression of Akhir al-Zaman has been used in hadiths in two meanings: The Time of the Prophet (s) The time beginning with the mission of the Prophet (s) until the Resurrection . In some hadiths, the Prophet (s) has been referred to as the Prophet (s) of the End Time. Such a description is related to the fact that the Prophet (s) was the Last of the Prophets (s), and his religion is valid until the end of the time due to its perfection, and he (s) is the Prophet (s) of the last part of the time on earth. The Time of the Coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a) In many hadiths, End Time refers to the time when the Savior (the Promised Mahdi) comes and the certain occurrences happening at three different times: Difficult trials of the End Time including the Battle of Kirkisia [5] Coming of the Savior and the battle between the truth and the falsehood [6] Victory of the truth over falsehood and the golden age of the world [7] Determining its Time The exact time for these signs has not been mentioned in hadiths and even determining the exact time for them has been rejected. No one knows the exact time of coming of the Savior other than God and it is one of the issues of the Unseen . Imam al-Rida (a) quoted from the Prophet (s) that the time of the uprising of the Promised Mahdi (a) is like the Day of Judgment which no one knows of its time other than God and will happen all of a sudden. Signs The signs mentioned for this age in Islamic hadiths are known as the signs of the End Time. Thus the coming of the Promised Mahdi (a) has been likened to the Resurrection because the same way the Resurrection has various signs ( Ashrat al-Sa'a ), the coming of the Promised Mahdi (a) has signs which happen before it. In some books, these signs have been called as Signs of the Reappearance ('Ala'im al-Zuhur) as one of the most significant happenings of this age is the coming of the Savior. Some of these signs are: Emergence of Sufyani [12] Emergence of Sayyid al-Hasani , dispute among descendants of Abbasids over kingdom [13] Eclipse of the sun in the middle of the month of Ramadan and the eclipse of the moon at the end of it [14] Rising the Sun from the west [15] Murdering al-Nafs al-Zakiyya (the Purified Soul) [16] Destruction of Kufa mosque , Emergence of Yamani , the permissibility of shedding the blood of people and taking their property [17] Emergence of Anti-Christ (Dajjal) [18] about which it is mentioned in hadiths that he will stay for forty days after emergence [19] and many people having weak faith will turn to him and this is because of extraordinary thing he will do. [20] Emergence of wars, massacres, and obliteration of the proofs of the truth [21] Emergence of great corruptions in the world [22] Escalation of chaos and weakening of people's faith [23] Taking the positions of the management of the society by incompetent people, the obedience of men from their wives, overvaluation of the world, lack of security [24] Emergence of different mischief and trials among Arabs [25] Disappearance of modesty among women and children [26] Prevalence of usury [27] Occurrence of great massacres in the world and emergence of trials [28] Men's needlessness of women and women's needlessness of men [29] Drinking alcoholic drinks and wearing silk [30] Differences with the Signs of the Apocalypse In the Qur'an and hadiths, there is another similar term called \" Ashrat al-Sa'a \" (signs of the moment) which refers to events happening of which is a sign of approaching the Apocalypse. In many Sunni sources and some Shia hadith collections , the signs of the coming Imam al-Mahdi (a) are mixed with the signs of approaching the Apocalypse, and even sometimes the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a) itself is mentioned as a sign of the Apocalypse. Generally, authors of Sunni hadith collections have assigned a section called Ashtrat al-Sa'a and even with the content of these hadiths is so much common with the hadiths about the End Time. Many of the signs have been mentioned in both groups of hadiths. Still, the issue of the End Time has always been clearly distinguished from the Apocalypse because the End Time refers to the last age in this world, but Ashrat al-Sa'a are the signs before the Resurrection. After the Coming of the Savior After the emergence of these signs, the coming of the Savior will happen, which is among the most important events of the End Time. From the most important events after the coming of Imam al-Mahdi (a), some facts can be mentioned: Fighting oppression and corruption and eradicating them [36] Saving humanity from dilemmas of sins , oppression, and corruption is among the Savior's goals which will be fulfilled at his time as Imam Ali (a) says, \"at the time of the al-Mahdi's (a) rule, the issues of adultery , drinking [alcoholic drinks] and usury will be eradicated.\" [37] Establishment of true Islam and worshiping God and monotheism in the whole world [38] Prevalence of religion [39] Acting upon religious values and merits and precise observation of religious orders and rulings [40] Establishment of security, so that the life, property, and honor of people in the society will be safe from others' violation [41] and through the Savior, routes will gain security. [42] Establishment of welfare for all people [43] so that all edible things will be accessible by human beings and people would easily use properties. [44] Development of cities in all the world [45] Development of friendship, kindness, and friendliness among all people, so that people would take as much as they need from their religious brothers' reserves without any problem. [46] Perfection of intellects and human's readiness for benefiting from divine teachings. [47] Perfection and developments in science and knowledge in all aspects and benefiting from the perfect scientific fruits by all people in the society [48] Acting upon the Book of God and the conduct of the Prophet (s) [49] These are among the events happening at the time of the Savior and are considered among the characteristics of this age. Coming of Jesus (a) According to hadiths, one of the important happenings of the time of the coming of the Savior is the coming of Prophet Jesus (a) from skies. From these hadiths, it can be learned that the Prophet Jesus (a) will participate in the world uprising of the End Time and comes from the skies to establish justice but under the flag of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and would not be independent. Jesus (a) will come down on the land of Palestine and will greet Imam al-Mahdi (a) and will pray behind him and help him in killing Anti-Christ (Dajjal). Raj'a Raj'a (the return) is among other important events in the golden age of the world after the coming of the Savior and his actions. Raj'a refers to the return to life of given past historical figures, from some righteous and some bad people, after their physical death. In Other Religions The concept of the End Time has been mentioned in other religions in other forms as well. In Christianity Meaning Christians speak of a time when the return of Jesus (a) will happen. Coming of Messiah (a) has been mentioned in the Bible more than three hundred times and some complete chapters are about that. Jesus (a) will come again in the End Time and complete the program to rescue people. They believe that the world will meet happiness in his coming and will be in complete peace after his coming. War and bloodshed will be gone and no group will then fight another. The belief about the victory of the truth over falsehood is evident in Christian culture and the Bible and in their views, the Savior is Messiah(a). Signs For the coming of Messiah who is Jesus (a), some signs have been mentioned as following: Messiah will come when people are sinful and oppression has taken over the world. [59] \"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\" [60] \"Shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.\" [61] According to the Bible, the emergence of Anti-Christ (Dajjal) is among the events before coming the Messiah. In Judaism Meaning In Judaism , \"the last days\" or \"the Day of Yahweh (the Lord)\" have been mentioned in many cases, referring to the time when the glory of Jews will reach its peak and sinners will perish and a king of Jesse's (David's father) descent upon whom the spirit of God is and is wise and God-wary will come and will fill the world with justice, goodness and blessings , as then \"the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the young goat.\" The Day of the Lord is when the course of history will reach its peak and perfection. Events before the Coming of Mashiach: There will be bloody wars at the time of the coming of Messiah due to political unrest. As it has been said that, \"whenever you see that governments engage in war with each other, expect the steps of Mashiach, because at the time of Prophet Abraham (a) it happened so and when the states engaged in war with each other, Abraham (a) came to save.\" Coming of Mashiach will be together with great difficulties. Before his coming chaos and corruption in the world will reach their peak and life's difficulties will be almost unbearable. These conflicts and wars among states of the world are called wars of Gog and Magog . Events after Coming of Mashiach The happenings of the time of Mashiach are: Cure of the sick [69] Trees bearing abundant fruits [70] Reconstruction of the ruins [71] Reconstruction of Jerusalem al-Quds [72] Establishment of peace throughout the nature [73] Disappearing crying in the world [74] Disappearing death in the world [75] In Zoroastrianism In Zoroastrianism , the coming of a savior at the End Time has been mentioned as well. In Zoroastrianism, this issue has been mentioned in a certain way according to their beliefs. They believe that a cosmological power or \"spirit of good\" called Ahura Mazda and an opposite cosmological power or great spirit of evil called Ahriman exist. During history, these two powers fight each other until the End Time when the good defeat the evil and a period of peace, purity, and promotion of Ahura Mazda will come and with the coming Saoshyant , the End Time comes. In one of the clauses of Gathas, which are the compositions of Zarathusthra (Zoroaster), there is a mention of a man who will come in the future and find the way of saving. Also in Gatha, in some places, the name Saoshyant has been mentioned who is the savior in Zoroastrianism. The term Frashokereti (final renovation of the universe) is another term mentioned in Gatha and refers to the End Time, when after weakness and then the destruction of Ahriman and its forces, the universe returns to its original perfection (Gatha Yasna Vahat). Thus, Saoshyant is the person who will come at the end of the world and is called the victor Saoshyant and also astvat-әrәta (from whose life, all humans become immortal). In Avesta, the word Saoshyant has been mentioned at least eight times and astvat-әrәta at least twice. Events after the Coming of Saoshyant One of the actions of this promised savior after his coming is the renovation of the universe and eradication of evil and darkness. The companions of this promised savior have been described as thinking good, speaking good, doing good and having good religion, and never tell lies.

{"title": "Angels", "text": "Angel or Malak (Arabic: مَلَک ) is an invisible supernatural being that serves as God ’s agent in this world and in the hereafter . The belief in the existence of angels is a fundamental Islamic doctrine. Shiite scholars believe that angels are infallible , in the sense that they never disobey God’s commands and never commit sins . Moreover, angels never neglect their duties, which include worship , exalting God , writing the letters of people’s deeds , delivering revelations to prophets , protecting people, assisting the believers , delivering material and spiritual livelihoods, taking people’s lives, guiding people’s hearts, and enforcing the divine punishment . Angels are classified into different groups and levels. Gabriel , Michael , Israfil , and Azrael are superior to other angels. There are theological and exegetical issues over whether angels are superior to humans, whether they are infallible, and whether they are physical or non-physical. There are various views about each of these issues. Muslim scholars disagree over the nature of angels. Muslim theologians believe that angels are physical beings that can take different forms, but Muslim philosophers believe that they are non-physical. The Nature of Angels Angels are entities that mediate between God and the human world. God has appointed them as His agents in the world. The Arabic word for angel is “malak,” the plural form of which is “mala'ika.” There are different views about the nature of angels. Muslim theologians believe that they fine illuminated physical things that can take various forms and shapes. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , most Muslim scholars hold this view, with the exception of some philosophers. Moreover, he believes that prophets and saints could see the angels. However, some philosophers believe that angels are beyond matter and material entities, holding that they have characteristics that cannot be found in physical objects. According to 'Allama Tabataba'i , the hadiths about angels taking various forms and shapes are concerned with imaginalization (that is, the appearance of something’s image for someone). Moreover, he believes that there is no valid evidence for the claim that angels and jinn are fine physical objects that take various forms. A hadith from Imam al-Sadiq (a) says that angels are created from light. Significance and Place The belief in the existence of angels is an Islamic doctrine. The belief in them is like the belief in the prayer and fasting ; that is, it is essential to the belief in prophethood . The term “malak” is used eighty-eight times in the Qur'an. In the Sermon of Skeletons (Khutbat al-Ashbah), Imam 'Ali (a) talks about the creation of angels, their types, characteristics, and tasks. In Bihar al-anwar , there are more than one hundred hadiths about the nature of angels, their tasks, their infallibility, and the characteristics of arch-angels (those closest to God). The third Supplication of al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya by Imam al-Sajjad (a) is about the arch-angels. It says that God’s greeting is the reason why angels are so pure . According to hadiths, angels constitute the largest population among God’s creatures. Many hadiths talk about the large number of angels. Some of them assert that angels were created after the creation of the lights of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) . Some polytheists worshiped angels. They believed that angels were God’s creatures, but they thought that angels were autonomous in their actions and are lords of the inferior beings. Moreover, some polytheists maintained that angels were God’s daughters. Angels in Other Religions Other religions also talk about angels. In Zoroastrianism , angels are believed to be created by Ahura Mazda, Amesha Spenta (arch-angels in Zoroastrianism) being manifestations of His attributes. In Judaism , angels are deemed servants of God as they enforce His commands on the earth and deliver revelation to people. Christians believe that angels were created before humans and serve as their custodians. It is common in Christian churches to greet and worship some angels such as Michael. Tasks The Quran enumerates the tasks of angels as follows: delivering revelation to prophets , administrating the affairs of the world, sending the divine grace to creatures, asking for God’s forgiveness , intercession for believers and helping them, cursing the disbelievers , registering people’s deeds, and taking their lives . There are angels who are constantly engaged in worshiping and exalting God, doing nothing else beside that. Angels are present in the world of Barzakh and the hereafter as well. Some of them inhabit the heaven and some are guardians of the hell . Degrees and Types 'Allama Tabataba'i believes that angels are of different degrees and rankings. Some are ranked lower than others. According to Quranic verses, some of them are agents of the arch-angel of revelation ( Gabriel ) and some are agents of the arch-angel of death ( Azrael ). Mulla Sadra classifies angels into several types, including arch-angels (the closest to God), roaming spirits (al-arwah al-muhayyama), angels responsible for heavenly bodies, intellectual angels, and earthly angels. Imam Khomeini divides them to angels who do not manipulate physical objects (roaming angels and those inhabiting the world of jabarut ) and those responsible for physical beings. Characteristics Here are some of the characteristics of angels. Infallibility According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , Shias believe that angels are infallible and immune to any minor or major sins . This is held by the majority of Sunni Muslims as well. Nevertheless, some Sunni Muslims reject the infallibility of angels, and some of them believe that only some of the angels are infallible, including those who deliver revelation and the arch-angels. Evidence for the infallibility of angels includes the Quranic verse “They do not venture to speak ahead of Him, and they act by His command” and “mighty angels, who do not disobey whatever Allah commands them.” However, some people have cast doubt on the infallibility of angels by making recourse to stories such as Harut and Marut , Iblis’s failure to prostrate for Adam (a), and Futrus ’s disobedience. Shiite scholars have responded to these cases. For instance, the story of the disobedience of Harut and Marut is said to be influenced by myths that do not appear in hadiths and the Qur'an. Moreover, they believe that Iblis was not an angel. Morteza Motahhari says that only some angels might disobey God’s commands. According to Nasir Makarim Shirazi , what appears in some hadiths about punishment of some angels for their dullness in complying with God’s commands does not count as a sin, but just a case of abandoning the better , as is the case about some prophets . 'Allama Tabataba'i holds that angels will whatever God wills, they act upon whatever God commands, and thus they never commit sins. Superiority to Humans Some religious scholars appeal to the Quranic verse “Certainly We have honored the Children of Adam (a), ..., and preferred them with a complete preference over many of those We have created” to argue that angels are superior to humans. Some have adduced the story of angels prostrating before Adam (a) and their being taught by Adam (a) as evidence for the superior of humans to angels, provided that they flourish their potentialities. According to Hasan Hasanzada Amuli , Ibn al-'Arabi believed that the supreme angels (roaming angels) were superior to humans, since they were not obliged to prostrate for Adam (a). Muhammad Dawud al-Qaysari holds that people who achieve the position of God’s vicegerent are even superior to the supreme angels. Mulla Sadra cites verse 31 of Quran 2 about Adam (a) teaching angels as evidence for the superiority of humans to angels who reside in the earth and in the sky, but not to the roaming angels. Superiority of Prophets to Angels Most Muslims believe that prophets are superior to angels, because they are infallible in spite of having irascible and appetitive faculties, unlike the angels. Moreover, Quranic verses such as the prostration of angels before Adam (a) and their being taught by Adam (a) are cited as evidence for the claim. Moreover, Shias believe that their Imams are also superior to angels. Human Manifestation According to Quranic verses, the Trustworthy Spirit appeared to Mary (a) in a human form. Moreover, there are hadiths to the effect that angels manifest in different forms to a person whose life they are about to take, in proportion to whether he or she is a believer or is vicious . Manifestation of angels occurs when they appear in a form other than their original form. No one other than the Prophet (s) has seen angels in their original form. Immateriality Muslim philosophers believe that angels are immaterial. Evidence for their immateriality includes their lack of material properties such as irascible and appetitive faculties, change, transformation, evolution, and being perceptible by senses. Nevertheless, Mulla Sadra disagrees with Quranic exegetes who believe that angels have static positions, claiming that knowledge and virtues of some angels grow over time. Imam 'Ali (a) says that some angels are the most knowledgeable and the closest creatures to God as sleep never falls on their eyes, negligence never happens in their intellect, and tire never occurs in their bodies. Wings On the face of it, some Quranic verses and hadiths imply that angels have wings. There are different accounts of what this means. 'Allama Tabataba'i takes this to mean that angels are equipped with a power by which they move from the sky to the earth, from the earth to the sky, and from any place to any place. It does not mean that they literally have wings like those of birds. [68] Imam Khomeini believes that angels in the supernatural realm are non-physical, immaterial, and hence they have no wings, but those in the imaginal world (ʿAlam al-Mithal) might have imaginal wings and feathers. [69] Ibn al-'Arabi construes the number of an angel’s wings as metaphorical for the extent of its influence in the kingdom of the sky and the earth. [70] Furthermore, the number of an angel’s wings is construed as relevant to their pace in compliance with God’s commands, their power of transition, and an indication of the different degrees of angels.

{"title": "Intizar al-Faraj", "text": "Intiẓār al-Faraj (Arabic: إنتظار الفَرَج ) or the Wait for the Relief is, in the Shiite terminology, the expectation for the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a) , which will occur miraculously and extraordinarily, as a result of which the world will be filled with justice . According to Shiite doctrines, the Wait for Relief requires spiritual and moral preparations. Terminology \"Faraj\" is an Arabic word meaning relief or release from griefs. In the phrase, \"Intizar al-Faraj\", it refers to the relief that people of the world will have after the Reappearance of the Twelfth Imam (a). The Virtue of the Wait and the Waiting Person in Hadiths Many virtues are mentioned in Shiite hadiths for the Wait and the person who waits (Muntazir). For example, the Wait for the Relief is said to be the best and the most lovely action and the first worship , and the Muntazir is said to be resurrected as a man of God , superior to others at all times, and among Ahl al-Bayt (a) . Imam al-Sadiq (a) says, \"Those who know the matter (i.e. the Imam of their time), they will wait for the Relief\". That is, if one knows the Imam of his time and knows what the Imam expects from his followers, he will then start an uprising against the unjust government, and the Relief (al-Faraj) is the day when the Imam's expectations are met. According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the Wait for Qa'im (a) is said to be a tenet of the religion along with testifying for the Oneness of God and the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) . Also, the Muntazir is said to be like someone who is in the camp together with al-Qa'im (a), waving his sword along with the Prophet (s), and is then martyred. Duties of the Waiting Person Given different views about the Islamic government in the period of Occlusion, there are different views about the obligations of a person who is waiting for the Reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (a). No Particular Duties Some people believe that the Occultaion of the Imam indicates that it is not possible to implement the Islamic rulings; otherwise, the Imam (a) himself would reappear. Thus, no attempt is needed. They believe that the Wait is tantamount to the surrender to the historical predetermination: we cannot help but live under injustice and corruptions until the Savior reappears. Such a Wait is at the service of unjust rulers to silence the people. According to another view about government in the period of Occultation , the Occultation leads to deprivation from all the blessings of the presence of the Imam (a), including an Islamic government. Some people have appealed to hadiths regarding taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) and applied them to the period of Occultation to show that dissimulation and silence towards unjust rulers are obligatory until the Uprising of Imam al-Mahdi (a) . Shiite Akhbaris who deny ijtihad reject any social roles for Shiite scholars, including the establishment of a government in the period of Occultation, because for them the views of a mujtahid are only probabilistic and thus unreliable. To the contrary, some scholars appeal to cases, such as a local government being assigned to Malik al-Ashtar or the issuance of fatwas being assigned to Aban b. Taghlib and Zakariyya b. Adam , to show that the views of a non-Infallible should be obeyed by others if that is grounded in his ijtihad. The Muntazir has Heavy Responsibilities However, many scholars believe that a Muntazir has heavy responsibilities. In his criticism of the above views, Imam Khomeini believes that taqiyya (precautionary dissimulation) is restricted to ancillaries of the religion ; it is not allowed with regard to the tenets of Islam . He emphasizes that we could not avoid the implementation of Islamic rulings in the last 1200 years, since the Reappearance might not occur until thousands of years later, we cannot avoid this now. For it is not acceptable to shut down the rulings and the Islam. Imam Khomeini defines the Wait for the Relief as follows: \"if a person who waits for Faraj thinks that he should only pray without having any other obligations, then he is not a true Muntazir, even if he acts upon his own Shari'a obligations.\" Imam Khomeini believes that we should expedite the Reappearance by providing its grounds. True Muntazir Not everyone can claim that he is waiting for the Faraj of the Occulted Imam (a) , because people who are waiting for a reformer should themselves be reformed and righteous , and a person can reform himself only if he knows the Imam of his time; otherwise he will be like someone who lives in the Age of Jahiliyya and will die like people of Jahiliyya. The Wait According to the Sunnis The Wait for al-Mahdi is not restricted to the Shi'a . There are mutawatir hadiths about al-Mahdi in Sunni sources with reliable chains of transmitters. In Sunni collections of hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad (s) is quoted as prognosticating that a man from the Household and the progeny of lady Fatima (a) will come, who will fill the world with justice. Abd al-Rahman b. Khaldun, a scholar of the ninth/ fifteenth century —who wrote a well-known prolegomenon to the book, al-Ibar —says, \"Be aware that the majority of Muslims throughout the ages have believed that in the End Time a man from the Household will inevitably reappear, who will support the religion, reveal the justice, and will be followed by Muslims. He will dominate the Islamic territories, and his holy name is al-Mahdi. According to reliable sources of hadiths, decisive Signs of Reappearance are Dajjals riot and other events will take place. [For example,] Jesus (a) , peace be upon him, will follow him and will kill Dajjal, or will reappear together with him and help him in killing Dajjal and will follow al-Mahdi, peace be upon him, in his prayer\". Although Sunni Muslims believe in the Wait for the Reappearance of al-Mahdi (a), they believe that he is not born yet. The Imami Shi'a and some other Islamic and non-Islamic denominations also wait for a savior who is born and alive and oversees the actions, sayings, and troubles of people.

{"title": "Prophethood", "text": "Al-Nubuwwa (Arabic: النُبُوَّة ) or Prophethood is a divine selection of a person to whom divine teachings are revealed in order to lead people to the path of perfection and happiness. The main features of the prophets include the reception of wahy (revelation), the power to perform miracles , and infallibility . The necessity of prophethood and the rise of prophets is emphasized in the Qur'an , hadiths from the Infallibles (a), and theological texts. Reasons given for its necessity include giving an ultimatum to human beings, their essential need for revelations, and their need for a community. According to the Qur'an, all the prophets shared common goals, such as calling to monotheism and resurrection , pursuit of justice , teaching and training people, purification of their souls, piety , and liberating people from their burdens and shackles. The doctrine of prophethood counts as a principle of religion , the belief in which is considered as a necessary condition of being a Muslim. In Islam , the doctrine refers to the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and other prophets referred to in the Qur'an or the Prophet Muhammad's (s) tradition . The prophethood began with Adam (a) , and according to explicit verses of the Qur'an, it ended with the Prophet Muhammad (s). This belief is shared by Shi'a and Sunni Muslims. By an appeal to Quranic verses and hadiths from the Infallibles (a), the Shi'as believe that after the end of prophethood, God has selected the Imams (a) to preserve and explain the religion . The Notion According to the Qur'an, prophethood is a divine selection of certain people to whom divine teachings are revealed in order to guide people to the path of perfection and happiness. The belief in prophethood is an essential element of Islam as well as other divine religions. The word, \"nubuwwa\" (Arabic: نبوّة ) and its cognates in Arabic have been used to mean different things, such as giving news , heights , going out of a place , a clear path , and a secret voice . According to the majority of scholars, there are differences between a \"nabi\" (Arabic: نبي , prophet) and a \" rasul \" (Arabic: رسول , meaning: messenger): while every \"rasul\" is also a \"nabi\", not all \"nabis\" are \"rasuls\". A \"rasul\" receives revelations in both waking and sleeping times, but a \"nabi\" only receives them while dreaming. Moreover, a revelation to a \"rasul\" is more transcendent than the one to a \"nabi\", since a revelation to a \"rasul\" is delivered by Jabra'il , while a revelation to a \"nabi\" is delivered by other angels or by an inspiration to the heart or through a true dream . However, some people take \"rasul\" and \"nabi\" to be synonymous. General and Special Prophethood In theological books, prophethood is discussed under two major sections i.e. general prophethood and special prophethood. General prophethood refers to a set of discussions addressing such issues as the necessity of sending prophets, infallibility and miracles while in special prophethood the issues about the prophethood of a specific individual are discussed including the reasons for his prophethood and his miracles. Reasons for its Necessity The necessity of prophethood has been emphasized by the Qur'an, hadiths from the Infallibles (a) , as well as theological texts. Reasons for its necessity include giving an ultimatum to people, as an essential need of human beings, and their need for a community. The Qur'an has emphasized the necessity of prophethood due to the human needs, including their need for justice , purification, and learning. [13] This is explained by the fact that human beings cannot realize justice in their communities on their own and without guidance by prophets, since the realization of justice in all aspects of life requires the clarification of its various instances by the prophets. Moreover, it requires that a justice-based law guarantees the rights of all people in all aspects. It also requires a just, fair enforcer who is not under the influence of his psychological desires and personal needs. [14] Since all these conditions require prophethood, they are considered as reasons for its necessity. Prophethood is also considered as a preliminary for other human needs, such as education and training. [15] The necessity of prophethood has been expressed in hadiths in different ways. In reply to a question, Imam al-Sadiq (a) referred to the impossibility of a direct relation between God and people and considered the prophets to be messengers who should be among people to let them know about divine commands and prohibitions. [16] In another hadith, Imam 'Ali (a) considered the reasons for prophethood to include the confirmation of the human intellect, revival of fitra (human initial nature), prevention of ignorance, as well as reminding divine blessings. [17] In Islamic mysticism , philosophy , and kalam : in the Islamic philosophy, the necessity of prophethood has been explained in mundane, this-worldly terms. They take prophethood to be necessary because human beings are social and civil creatures, and a social life requires prophets. [18] In Islamic theology or kalam, the necessity of prophethood is explained, inter alia , by the Principle of Kindness (Qa'ida al-Lutf). According to this principle, since God is required to help His servants to obey Him and to avoid sins , He is required to send prophets. [19] In Islamic mysticism, the necessity of prophethood is explained in terms of a heavenly outlook according to which the existence of a Perfect Man (al-Insan al-Kamil) is necessary, and thus, prophethood is necessary. In other words, Muslim mystics take the prophet to be a complete manifestation of the Greatest Name (al-Ism al-A'zam) of God, and thus, maintain that the presence of such a person is necessary. [20] Goals According to Quranic verses , all prophets shared some goals, including the call for monotheism and resurrection , establishing justice, education and training, purification and piety , as well as liberating people from their burdens and shackles. The call to monotheism is taken to be the most important goal of prophets. According to the Qur'an , all prophets called people to believe in monotheism and avoid polytheism and idolatry . [22] According to the Qur'an, the call to resurrection was also a goal of prophets. They warned people about a life after death in which all human actions will be examined, and so, everyone has to be careful about what they do in order to avoid being punished in the Afterlife . [23] The Qur'an takes justice to be another goal of prophets. They fought social corruptions and tried to establish justice in their communities. [24] The prophet Saleh 's fight with extravagance and wastefulness, [25] Lot 's fight with sexual deviations, [26] and Shu'ayb 's fight with fraudulent transactions and economical corruptions [27] are instances of attempts made by prophets to establish social justice, as mentioned in the Qur'an. [28] Purification of the soul and piety are also goals of prophets which, according to the Qur'an, play a significant role in the salvation of the human being. Purification is mentioned as a goal of prophets in at least three Quranic verses. Piety is also mentioned in various Quranic verses as a goal of prophets. In Sura al-Shu'ara' and Sura al-Saffat , there are verses with the same composition implying that prophets such as Noah (a) [29] , Hud (a) [30] , Saleh (a) [31] , Lot (a) [32] , Shu'ayb (a) [33] , and Elijah (a) [34] have recommended their people to observe piety. [35] Characteristics  Prophets have certain characteristics, such as the direct or indirect reception of wahy (revelation), performing miracles to prove their prophethood, as well as 'isma (infallibility). Reception of Revelations \"Wahy\" (or revelation)—the conveyance of God's words to prophets—is, according to the Qur'an, a common characteristic of all prophets, including Noah (a), Ibrahim (a) , Isma'il (a) , Jesus (a) , and Muhammad (s) . God conveys religious doctrines and orders to guide people to prophets through Jabra'il or without any mediation. Miracles A miracle is an extraordinary act performed by prophets to prove their prophethood—such acts are the ones that cannot be done by ordinary people. Various verses of the Qur'an refer to miracles by prophets. The majority of Shiite theologians believe that miracles are directly performed by God. On the contrary, the majority of the philosophers maintain that prophets can perform miracles because of the extraordinary power of their souls. Infallibility According to Shiite theologians , infallibility is a grace bestowed by God, and according to philosophers, it is an internal power within the prophets which helps them avoid sins or disobedience of God, although they have the power to do so. Some Shiite muhaddiths , such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq , believe that prophets become infallible from the beginning of their prophethood. According to al-Saduq, the prophet might make inadvertent mistakes (\"sahw\"). However, al-Shaykh al-Mufid , a prominent student of al-Shaykh al-Saduq, criticized his teacher's view, considering the theory of inadvertent mistakes to fail to acknowledge the place of prophets. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid takes the infallibility of the Prophet Muhammad (s) to be superior and more wide-ranging than that of other prophets. Prophets The first prophet was Adam (a) who was created, together with his wife, Eve , in heaven , and was ousted from there because of eating the \" forbidden fruit \". And the last prophet was Muhammad (s) who was born in 570 in Mecca . Five prophets are considered as Ulu l-'Azm , that is, they brought a new religion with new rulings. Other prophets propagated the religion of their Ulu al-'Azm predecessors. Prophets have different degrees. The Qur'an has only mentioned twenty-six prophets. In most of the hadiths , the number of prophets is said to be 124000, 313 of which are \"rasuls\". According to other hadiths, there were eight thousand prophets. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , these eight thousand people were prominent prophets. Prophets with a Divine Book Some prophets had a divine book. Divine messages they received were collected in a sacred or a divine book and served as the main source for their followers to act upon. Some prophets who had a divine book include: Noah (a), Ibrahim (a) ( Suhuf or Scrolls of Abraham), David (a) ( Zabur ), Moses (a) ( Torah ), Jesus (a) ( Gospel ), and Muhammad (s) (the Qur'an). Women’s Prophethood No women in the Quran is called a \"prophet\" or \"apostle\" and thus the commentators have disagreed as to whether there were any female prophets. Opponents Al-Baydawi , the Sunni commentator of the 8th/14th century states that it is the consensus of Muslims that women did not reach the position of prophethood. According to some other commentators, almost all Muslim scholars agree that there were no female prophets. Allama Tabatabai believes that women were not prophets, but there is another kind of revelation that is not exclusive to prophets such as the revelation to the mother of Moses . Ayatollah Javadi Amoli maintains that there are two types of prophethood: informed ( inba'i ) prophethood and legislative ( tashri'i ) prophethood. Since the latter involves administrative tasks, it was not given to women, but the former, which is about knowing the truths of the world, is not exclusive to men. Among the reasons used by the opponents of the prophethood of women is the verse \"We did not send [any apostles] before you except as men to whom We revealed\" , which indicates that only men reached this position. Proponents Al-Qurtubi, the 7th/13th century commentator, believes that Mary reached the position of prophethood, because, like other prophets, God spoke to her through angels. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani reports that Abu l-Hasan al-Ash'ari and Ibn Hazm believed in the prophethood of women. The latter counted Eve , Sarah , Hagar , Moses’ mother, Asiya (a) , and Mary (a) among prophets. The Finality of Prophethood Khatamiyya (or Finality of Prophethood) is a theological notion and a doctrine shared by all Muslims. According to this doctrine, there will be no prophets after the Prophet Muhammad (s) and thus, there will be no new religion after Islam . The term has its origin in the Qur'an. According to the verse 40 of Sura al-Ahzab , Muhammad (s) was the last prophet. The belief in the finality of prophethood was a widely-accepted doctrine both in the period of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and later. It has always been considered as an essential part of Islam, that is, if someone denies the finality of prophethood, then they will be excommunicated from Islam and it would be as if they have not accepted the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s). Imamate The Shi'as appeal to several Quranic verses and hadiths , such as Hadith al-Thaqalayn , to hold that after the end of prophethood, God has preserved the last religion—Islam—by Imams who are supposed to protect the religion. They believe that the last Imam who is still alive and lives anonymously will someday be commissioned to rule the whole world with Islam and guide the human beings to perfection.

{"title": "Resurrection", "text": " Resurrection (Arabic: معاد , Maʿād) is one of the roots of faith in Islam and means the return of people after death into life on the Day of Judgment ( qiyama ). According to this belief, all of the people will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment and their actions will be judged in the presence of God and they will be requited. Resurrection has a great importance in Islam and nearly one third of Qur'an is about the resurrection and subjects related to it. Believing in the resurrection has a great effect in the manner of life and causes people to do more good and avoid evil. Resurrection could be imagined in two ways: spiritual resurrection, bodily resurrection. The most important objections proposed about the subject is about the rational possibility of resurrection; some of which are: the objection of the eater and the eaten , the objection of returning the extinct , and the objection about the knowledge and the power of God. Qur'an mentions some instances of resurrection in order to prove the possibility of resurrection. Proving the rational possibility of resurrection is possible using rational reasons, like the argument of creation ( fitra ), the argument of wisdom, the argument of justice, and the argument of mercy. Concept Ma'ad (Arabic: معاد ) means to return; and in the terminology of theology , it means revival of people after death, and in judgment day (qiyama) their actions will be judged and the righteous people will reach their reward and the bad people will receive their punishment . Importance Believing in the resurrection influences the life in two ways: Personal life : The main motive of the person's actions is to fulfill the one's needs and wishes, and ultimately to reach an eternal happiness without any suffering. But the behavior of a person is related to the recognition of the goals of life. If someone assumes that the life is only limited to the worldly life, he will put all his efforts in order to reach the worldly joys and to benefit the most from the rich of the world. In contrast, when someone recognizes himself upper than the worldly life and does not acknowledge the death as the end of life, and considers his actions as a road to reach his eternal happiness in the afterlife (akhira), plans his life in a way to be the most beneficent for his eternal life. Social life : The belief in the resurrection, has a great effect on the social life and the mutual behavior of people. Believing in the next life and the eternal reward and punishment, has a great effect on regarding the other's rights and helping the poor. When this belief is accepted in a society, there will be less pressure needed for implementation of the just rules and for prevention of cruelty. Obviously if this belief was globally accepted, the international struggles would be less. The importance of the belief in the resurrection is to the extent that even the monotheism , if not accompanied by believing in the resurrection, is not enough for giving a direction to one's life. This is the reason of the emphasis of the Abrahamic religions on resurrection and the especial effort of divine prophets in the strengthening of the belief in hearts of people. Soul The correct imagination of resurrection is only possible when the true realization of the soul is achieved. In the divine view, the soul is something other than the body and its attributes. It is necessary to note and admit some points about the soul: The soul exists The soul is something substantive , not one of the accidents for the body. The soul is independent from the body and remains alive after the body decomposes. The combination of the soul and the body is not a combination in which with the death of one side, the other side also dies, but the soul is the main part of the existence of human and as far as the soul lives, the identity and the character of the person is preserved. This is the reason why the replacement of the body cells does not compromise the unity of the person; because the true criterion of the unity of a human, is the unity of his soul. The soul is taken by the angel of death ( 'Izra'il ), while the body gradually decomposes and disappears. The Qur'an (32:10-11), mentioning the existence of the soul, answers the objection of deniers of resurrection: “ وَقَالُوا أَإِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِي الْأَرْضِ أَإِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ ۚ بَلْ هُمْ بِلِقَاءِ رَبِّهِمْ كَافِرُونَ (10) قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ They say, 'When we have been lost in the dust, shall we be indeed created anew?' Rather they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord. (10) Say, '{You will not be lost, but} You will be taken away by the angel of death, who has been charged with you. Then you will be brought back to your Lord.' ” — Qur'an, 32:10, 11 Theories Denial of resurrection Some of the old theologians thought that, the resurrection means the returning of the extinct. They thought that when one dies, one completely disappears and becomes extinct; so when the religions announce about the resurrection it means that the human after becoming extinct, will be returned. Proving the resurrection Those who believe in resurrection hold various opinions as follows: Spiritual resurrection only : Islamic Peripatetic philosophers not only considered the bodily resurrection improvable, but also because of rational objections, recognized it as unacceptable. They believed that the resurrection is the return of the soul, without the body, because the body is destroyed after death and only the soul remains. Yet according to Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) the greatest Islamic Peripatetic philosopher, although it is rationally unprovable that the body returns on the Day of Judgment, but because the Prophet (s) had announced it, this is a proof and it must be believed. [5] Bodily resurrection only : According to this view, the whole reality of man is his body and after death it decomposes. in the Judgement Day, this body by divine knowledge and power will reconstruct. In this view there is no resurrection for soul. [6] Spiritual and Bodily resurrection : This view is a kind of combination between previous theories. Supporters of this view explain their idea differently: The return of soul to the very mundane material body The return of the soul to the etheric body The return of the elemental body to the immaterial soul The return of the soul to a developed elemental body The soul creates a body for itself adaptive to its attributes and the world after the Resurrection Resurrection with a Hurqaliya'i body Proving the Resurrection There are two kinds of reasons for proving the resurrection. The first, proves the necessity of the other world, and the second, proves the possibility of the resurrection. Some of the reasons are mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith . Reasons of the Necessity of the Resurrection Reason of the Creation (Fitra) The reason consists of some premises: Every human, by creation ( fitra ), has a desire to be eternal. No desire in human is null, because God is wise and the wise does not do anything null. The worldly life is not eternal So it is necessary to have a permanent world, in which the desire of human to be eternal is satisfied. [7] Reason of Wisdom (Hikma) The reason consists of some premises: Human and the world are creations of God Creations of God are not null God has created the world in such a manner that the most goodness possible is accomplished. The material world, is a mixture of good and evil that are in struggle with each other. Human, has an immortal soul and can reach a permanent goodness. If the life is limited to this world, the aim of God from the creation of the world is not fulfilled, because there's no benefit in making a thing, then destroying it. So knowing that God is wise, there must be another world beyond this worldly life, so that the aim of the creation is satisfied, especially due to many difficulties in this worldly life, so even if the permanent continuation of the worldly life was possible, it was not compatible with the wisdom of God. The reason is mentioned in Qur'an (44:38-41): “ وَ ما خَلَقْنَا السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضَ وَ ما بَینَهُما لاعِبینَ (38) ما خَلَقْناهُما إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَ لکنَّ أَکثَرَهُمْ لا یعْلَمُونَ (39) إِنَّ یوْمَ الْفَصْلِ میقاتُهُمْ أَجْمَعینَ We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them for play (38) We did not create them except with reason; but most of them do not know (39) Indeed the Day of Judgement is the tryst for them all. ” — Qur'an, 44:38-40 Reason of Mercy God is merciful ; The mercy of God covers all of His creatures; Covering of the God's mercy to all of creatures requires that every creature has a chance to activate its talents; Human achieves the maturity and gains the ability to benefit from spiritual gifts; This world, because of its limits, does not have the capacity of the spiritual gifts. So there have to be another world in which everyone can benefit from the results of the maturity one has achieved. In Qur'an (6:12) this reason is mentioned: “ قُلْ لِمَنْ ما فِی السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضِ قُلْ لِلَّهِ کتَبَ عَلی نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ لَیجْمَعَنَّکمْ إِلی یوْمِ الْقِیامَةِ لا رَیبَ فیهِ الَّذینَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لا یؤْمِنُونَ Say, 'To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?' Say, 'To Allah. He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself. He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Those who have ruined their souls1 will not have faith.' ” — Qur'an, 6:12 Reason of Justice One of the attributes of God is Justice; In the worldly life people have free will to choose between good and bad actions; Some people have used their freedom to worship God and serve of others; and in contrast, there are criminals who have chased their lust in their lifetime and have committed the worst sins; The divine justice of God requires that everyone sees the results of his actions, good people get rewarded, and the bad get their punishment. This world does not have the capacity that people see the requital of their actions; as most of the people do not see the punishment or the reward of their actions in their life; Therefore, as this world is for the test of people and fulfilling the tasks God had appointed them to; there must be another world for people to see the results of their actions, so that the justice of God be fulfilled. In the Qur'an, in some verses, the difference of the good people and the bad, and their different destinations, is mentioned (45:21-22): “ أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذینَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّیئاتِ أَنْ نَجْعَلَهُمْ کالَّذینَ آمَنُوا وَ عَمِلُوا الصَّالِحاتِ سَواءً مَحْیاهُمْ وَ مَماتُهُمْ ساءَ ما یحْکمُونَ (21) وَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّماواتِ وَ الْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ وَ لِتُجْزی کلُّ نَفْسٍ بِما کسَبَتْ وَ هُمْ لا یظْلَمُونَ Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make! (21) Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. ” — Qur'an, 45:21-22 Reasons of the Possibility of the Resurrection In the Qur'an different occurrences of the dead returning to life is mentioned, so that the believers in the Qur'an are assured that the resurrection is possible and feasible, and God is able to do it. The cases of the dead becoming alive mentioned in the Qur'an are: Companions of the Cave : The story of the companions of the cave is mentioned in the Qur'an, Allah introduces the reason of their second life and the discovery of people about them, for that people know that there is no doubt about the occurrence of the resurrection. “ وَکذَلِک أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَیهِمْ لِیعْلَمُوا أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَا رَیبَ فِیهَا Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make! (21) Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. ” — Qur'an, 45:21-22 Resurrection Miracles of Jesus In the Qur'an the miracles of Jesus ('Isa) (a) is mentioned, that he was rising the dead, with the permission of God (3:49): “ وَ أُبْرِئُ الْأَکمَهَ وَ الْأَبْرَصَ وَ أُحْی الْمَوْتی بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ And I heal the blind and the leper and I revive the dead by Allah's leave. ” — Qur'an, 3:49 Budding of the Plants The budding of the plants in the spring after they became dry in the autumn is similar to the resurrection of human after death. Qur'an (30:50) considers the budding of the plants as an example of the rising of the dead: “ فَانظُرْ إِلَی آثَارِ رَحْمَتِ اللَّهِ کیفَ یحْیی الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا إِنَّ ذَلِک لَمُحْیی الْمَوْتَی وَهُوَ عَلَی کلِّ شَیءٍ قَدِیرٌ So observe the effects of Allah's mercy: how He revives the earth after its death! Indeed He is the reviver of the dead, and He has power over all things. ” — Qur'an, 30:50 Also there are other instances of the resurrection mentioned in the Qur'an such as the resurrection of birds for Prophet Ibrahim (a) and resurrection of 'Uzayr , one hundred years after death. Resurrection in the Qur'an Importance of the Resurrection in the Qur'an More than one third of the verses of Qur'an , are about the eternal life; these verses could be categorized in seven categories: Verses that state the necessity of believing in the afterlife ( akhira ) [11] Verses that state the harsh results of rejecting the resurrection. [12] Verses that mention the eternal gifts of the paradise [13] Verses that mention the punishments of the hell [14] Verses that note the connection of good and bad actions with the destination in the afterlife Verses that describe the possibility and the necessity of the resurrection Verses answered the questions and objections of the deniers of the resurrection Verses that state that the root of all the crimes and the deviances is the denial of the resurrection. [15] Most of the dialogues and advices of the prophets to their people was on the subject of the resurrection. Their effort to prove the resurrection was even more than monotheism ; because the resistance of people in accepting this subject is more than other beliefs. Roots of the Denial of the Resurrection In the Qur'an's view, the root of some people's denial of the resurrection is: Materialism : In the view of materialists, every incorporeal subject is denied. Tendency to irresponsibility : the psychological motive of tendency to irresponsibility and immorality, causes the denial of the resurrection; because believing in the resurrection and the Day of Judgment is a powerful factor for feeling responsibility and accepting the moral limitations and self-controlling. On the contrary, denying the resurrection opens all the gates to all of evil (Qur'an, 75:5): “ أَ یحْسَبُ الْإِنْسانُ أَلَّنْ نَجْمَعَ عِظامَهُ (3) بَلی قادِرِینَ عَلی أَنْ نُسَوِّی بَنانَهُ (4) بَلْ یرِیدُ الْإِنْسانُ لِیفْجُرَ أَمامَهُ Does man suppose that We shall not put together his bones? (3) Yes indeed, We are able to proportion [even] his fingertips! (4) Rather, man desires to go on living viciously. ” — Qur'an, 75:5 Some theoretical objections : there has been some theoretical objections about the possibility of the resurrection due to some ambiguity in resurrection and how it will occur. Answer to Some Objections Objection of the Eater and the Eaten According to the objection of the eater and the eaten, which is one of the oldest objections about the bodily resurrection, if a person becomes the food for another person, in the time of the resurrection, will the eaten parts be in the body of the eater or in the body of the eaten? Either way, the body of one of them will not be resurrected completely. Based on this objection, the Peripatetic philosophers believed that the bodily resurrection is not rationally provable. But the theologians attempted to answer the objection. Most of the theologians, differentiated between the primary and secondary parts of body, and claimed that the primary parts of human body never become part of the body of another. Mulla Sadra , proposing the theory of the imaginal body, which is not a subject to this objection, offered another expression for the bodily resurrection. Objection of the Returning of the Extinct One of the objections discussed about the resurrection is that when a human dies, his/her body becomes extinct. Then, if the resurrection is true, so God has to return something that is extinct; and because the return of the extinct is rationally impossible, so is the resurrection. In Qur'an the objection and its answer is mentioned (32:10-11): “ وَقَالُوا أَئِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِی الْأَرْضِ أَئِنَّا لَفِی خَلْقٍ جَدِیدٍ بَلْ هُم بِلِقَاء رَبِّهِمْ کافِرُونَ (10) قُلْ یتَوَفَّاکم مَّلَک الْمَوْتِ الَّذِی وُکلَ بِکمْ ثُمَّ إِلَی رَبِّکمْ تُرْجَعُونَ They say, 'When we have been lost in the dust, shall we be indeed created anew?' Rather they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord (10) Say, 'You will be taken away by the angel of death, who has been charged with you. Then you will be brought back to your Lord.' ” — Qur'an, 32:10-11 So the resurrection is the return of the existing soul not something extinct. Objection about the knowledge and the power of God and the ability of body In the objection, it is stated that every action need a doer and also an object to which the action be applied. If the resurrection is going to be done, on the one hand, there must be someone with enough knowledge and power to do so, and on the other hand, the body must have the ability to be returned, while the life has its own conditions which becomes available gradually, like an embryo in a womb with appropriate conditions gradually becomes complete and turns into a human; but in a body which is dead and disjointed such a condition is not present so it cannot come back to life. Qur'an answered the objection in some verses, in some, compared the resurrection to the germination of seeds from the soil, and in some other compared the resurrection with the first creation of human (22:5); and so mentions the infinite knowledge of God and His power to resurrect the people; so it is possible that a rotten body which is turned into soil rises and comes back to life: “ یا أَیهَا النَّاسُ إِنْ کنْتُمْ فِی رَیبٍ مِنَ الْبَعْثِ فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاکمْ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ نُطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ مُضْغَةٍ مُخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَیرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ لِنُبَینَ لَکمْ... وَتَرَی الْأَرْضَ هَامِدَةً فَإِذَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَیهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنْبَتَتْ مِنْ کلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِیجٍ O people! If you are in doubt about the resurrection, [consider that] WE indeed created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then from a clinging mass, then from a fleshy tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest [Our power] to you... And you see the earth torpid, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells, and grows every delightful kind [of plant]. ” — Qur'an, 22:5 About the ability of the dead body for becoming alive again, it must be said that the rules and the system present in the world is not the only system possible, and the rules and causes known in the world are not the only rules and causes for the occurrences, as there have occurred many extraordinary occurrences like the livening of dead people and animals, some of which are mentioned in the Qur'an. Qur'an (20:51-52) says about the infinite knowledge of God: “ قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَی (51) قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّی فِی کتَابٍ لَّا یضِلُّ رَبِّی وَلَا ینسَی He (Pharaoh) said, 'What about the former generations?' (51) He (Moses) said, 'Their knowledge is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord neither makes any error nor forgets.' ” — Qur'an, 20:51-52 See also Usul al-din Hereafter Day of Separation Notes References Names Stations Beliefs Signes Related Death Related and Tribes and Groups Others Common principles of Islam Specific principles of Shia"}
{"title": "Hereafter", "text": " The Hereafter or Ākhira (Arabic: الآخرة ) is the world after death , or the world after this world. The Hereafter is contrasted to the life in this world. The belief in the Hereafter is deemed a principle of Islam , which means that those who do not believe in the Hereafter do not count as Muslims. The Quran emphasizes the significance of the Hereafter, and the belief in life after death has been a tenet of all religions . It is said that more than one third of Quranic verses are concerned with the afterlife or the Hereafter. In Islamic theological books, the Hereafter is referred to as resurrection , for which transmitted and rational evidence is cited. Muslim scholars have adduced Quranic verses to show that the Hereafter is a world totally different from this world. They attribute specific features to it, including eternity, the distinction between the virtuous and evil-doers, seeing the outcomes of one’s deeds, and enjoyment of blessings in accordance with one’s merits. Some Muslim scholars maintain that the Hereafter begins once life in this world comes to an end, but others believe that the Hereafter exists at present—simultaneously with life in this world—and indeed, it encompasses this world. The Nature of the Hereafter Literally, the term al-akhira (the Hereafter) means the final, the subsequent, or the other. It refers to another world that comes after this world. The Quran describes the afterlife or post-mortem life as the Hereafter (104 times). It sometimes uses phrases such as “the abode of the Hereafter” and “the Last Day.” The Significance of the Belief in the Hereafter The belief in the Hereafter is a principle of the religion and a requirement for being a Muslim. That is, those who deny the Hereafter do not qualify as Muslims. According to Murtada Mutahhari , the second major doctrine—after monotheism —to which all prophets have called people is the belief in the Hereafter. According to Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi , more than one third of Quranic verses are concerned with the Hereafter. The Quran refers to the belief in the Hereafter as a tenet of all prophetical messages . Quranic verses describe the belief in the Hereafter as one of the three tenets of Islam, along with beliefs in God and in the prophet . There is a consensus among all Islamic denominations to the effect that the belief in the Hereafter is an essential of the religion ; that is, those who do not believe in it do not count as Muslims. In Islamic theological books, the Hereafter is discussed in terms of the “principle of resurrection or the return.” There are other issues associated with the Hereafter, including the barzakh (the purgatory), the resurrection , the bridge of sirat , reckoning (hisab), intercession , the Heaven , and the Hell , which figure in the Quran, hadiths , and the writings of Muslim scholars. According to the Quran, a Muslim should believe in all these. Arguments for the Existence of the Hereafter Muslim scholars hold that the main argument for the existence of the Hereafter consists in transmitted or textual evidence, including the revelation . That is, the fact that the prophets are infallible , and they report about the existence of the Hereafter and call people to this belief, is evidence for the existence of the Hereafter. A case in point is verse 7 of Qur'an 64 : “Say, ‘Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected.” According to Murtada Mutahhari , there are other non-transmitted or non-textual means by which one might prove the existence of the Hereafter. At least, they constitute evidence or signs for its existence. He mentions three such means: (1) knowledge of God, (2) knowledge of the world, and (3) knowledge of the human spirit or soul. Philosophical arguments presented by theologians for the existence of the Hereafter include the argument from divine wisdom and the argument from divine justice. The argument from divine wisdom runs as follows: it would be incompatible with the divine wisdom if He limited the human life, which is capable of eternity, to life in this world. This is because God has created human beings so that they could attain the greatest possible excellence or perfection, and this could not be realized in this world, because the existential value of afterlife perfections is incomparable to that of this-worldly perfections. The argument from divine justice proceeds as follows: since the virtuous and evil-doers do not see their proper rewards or punishments in this world, God’s justice requires the existence of another world in which each person receives what they deserve. Characteristics of the Hereafter and Its Difference from This World According to Murtada Mutahhari , there are dozens of Quranic verses concerning issues associated with the Hereafter, including life after death, the day of resurrection , how the dead would be resurrected, the scale, reckoning, records of people’s deeds, the Heaven , the Hell , and the eternity of the Hereafter. Muslim scholars have adduced Quranic verses to show that the Hereafter is radically different from this world and its governing order. In the Hereafter, all people who were born from the beginning to the end of the creation will live at the same time. People in the Hereafter are either absolutely happy or absolutely miserable, the former are provided with whatever they wish to have, and the latter suffer from everything they see as bad or painful. However, life in this world is a mixture of life and death, privilege and deprivation, misery and happiness, suffering and comfort, and sorrow and delight. The following are other characteristics of the Hereafter in accordance with Quranic verses and hadiths : Eternity: According to Quranic verses, the Hereafter is eternal or endless. For instance, verse 34 of Qur'an 50 states that, in the Hereafter, inhabitants of the Heaven are given the good tidings that “This is the day of immortality.” Moreover, in Ghurar al-hikam , Imam 'Ali (a) is quoted as saying that “this world comes to an end, while the Hereafter is eternal.” [22] The distinction between the virtuous and evil-doers: According to Quranic verses, in the Hereafter, the virtuous will be separated from evil-doers: \"And ‘Get apart today, you guilty ones!’\" [23] \"and the faithless will be gathered toward Hell, o that Allah may separate the bad ones from the good [24] \"Those who are wary of their Lord will be led to paradise in throngs.\" [25] \"and drive the guilty as a thirsty herd towards hell\" [26] Seeing the outcomes of one’s deeds: According to Quranic verses, people will see the outcomes of their deeds in the Hereafter: \"and that he will soon be shown his endeavour\" [27] \"So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it. [28] Merit-based privileges: In contrast to this world, in the Hereafter everyone would have what they deserve to have. According to a hadith from Imam 'Ali (a), “circumstances of this world are governed by incidents, while those of the Hereafter are governed by people’s entitlements.” [29] The Scope of the Hereafter There is a disagreement over the scope of the Hereafter: some people believe that it begins with a person’s death and his or her entrance in the world of barzakh (the purgatory). On the other hand, those who maintain that barzakh is not part of the Hereafter say that the latter begins when the world of barzakh comes to an end. Furthermore, theologians believe that the Hereafter occurs in the temporal future of this world; that is, it begins once life in this world comes to an end altogether. However, Muslim philosophers believe that the Hereafter exists at present; that is, it exists alongside life in this world. In other words, the Hereafter is a world with a higher-ranking existence than that of this world, and thus, it encompasses the latter. A Quranic verse adduced by these philosophers is verse 49 of Qur'an 9 : “indeed hell besieges the faithless.” Quranic and Hadith Recommendations about the Hereafter There are recommendations about the Hereafter in Quranic verses and hadiths, including the following: The life of the world is nothing but play and diversion, and the abode of the Hereafter is surely better for those who are Godwary. Do you not exercise your reason? [32] This is the abode of the Hereafter, which We shall grant to those who do not desire to domineer in the earth nor to cause corruption, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary. [33] Bibliography A book is written about the Hereafter by Shaykh 'Abbas Qummi , a scholar in the fourteenth/twentieth century, under Manazil al-akhira (Stations of the Hereafter). In this book, he describes the stages of the Hereafter in the following order: death, grave, barzakh, resurrection, and sirat (the bridge). The book also talks about the scale ( mizan ), reckoning, and punishments of the Hell. It recommends certain worships and moral manners for an easier experience of these afterlife stages. Manazil al-akhira was written in Persian, and it has been translated into Arabic, English, Turkish, and Urdu.

{"title": "Ruh al-qudus", "text": "Rūḥ al-qudus (Arabc: رُوح‌ُ القُدُس ) or the Holy Spirit , is a being whose nature has been a matter of disagreement among Muslim scholars. Some maintain that it is another name for Gabriel , others take consider is a being from the World of Command, a hidden force, the Active Intellect, the Spirit of the Spirits, or the greatest angel. In Islamic sources, such tasks as conveying revelation to prophets, helping believers , being the source of the knowledge of prophets , being the source from which the Imams (a) receive their knowledge, and intercession on the Day of Judgment have been attributed to the Holy Spirit. In Christianity , the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity and is considered divine by mainstream Christians. The Nature of the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit is the spirit that is free from defects and imperfections. This word is mentioned in the Quran and the Bible. The Quran mentions that the Quran was sent down by the Holy Spirit 3 and that Jesus was supported by it. Muslim scholars disagree as to the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit. Gabriel: Some Quranic commentators consider the Holy Spirit to be Gabriel. [4] Calling Gabriel the Holy Spirit indicates his holiness as well as his role in preserving religion . [5] A being from the World of Command: Allama Tabatabai maintains that the Holy Spirit is not an angel but a being from the World of Command , who would convey revelation to prophets. [6] The greatest angel: According to a hadith attributed to Imam al-Sadiq (a) , the Holy Spirit is an angel greater than Gabriel and Michael , who accompanied Prophet Muhammad (s) and then the Imams (a). [7] According to other hadiths, the Holy Spirit is the spirit, [8] which, according to the Quran, comes down together with Angels on the Night of Ordainment . [9] A Hidden Force: According to a view, the Holy Spirit is a hidden force [10] with which Jesus (a) revived the dead. A weaker degree of this force exists in other believers as well and helps them in the path of God. [11] The first being: According to Sayyid Haydar Amuli , the Holy Spirit is a name for the first created being. [12] The Spirit of the Spirits: In some mystical works, the Holy Spirit is said to be the Spirit of the Spirits, which is not a created being but rather a face among the faces of God, upon which the essence of created beings depends. [13] Tasks The Quran and hadiths mention a number of tasks for the Holy Spirit. Conveying the revelation to prophets: According to the view that the Holy Spirit is Gabriel, bringing revelation and conveying divine messages were among its tasks. Supporting prophets and the Friends of God: According to a number of Quranic verses the Holy Spirit supported Jesus (a). [14] The source of prophets’ knowledge: According to some hadiths , prophets and Imams have five spirits, and the Holy Spirit is one of them. This spirit is that by which prophets and Imams gain their knowledge. [15] Conveying divine verdict: According to hadiths, the Holy Spirit conveys divine verdicts to the Ahl al-Bayt (a) . [16] Intercession: Based on a hadith from the Prophet (s), the first interceder on the Day of Judgment is the Holy Spirit. [17] Supporting believers: It is stated in some hadiths that the Holy Spirit supports believers as long as they support the Prophet (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). [18] Ibn Athir reports that the Prophet (s) asked God to support Hassan b. Thabit , a poet who composed poems in defense of the Prophet (s), with the Holy Spirit as long as he supported the Prophet (s). [19] Notes References"}
{"title": "Seven Heavens", "text": "The Seven Heavens (Seven Skies) or al-Samāwāt al-Sabʿ (Arabic: السَّماوات السَّبْع ) or Sabʿ Samāwāt (Arabic: ٍسَبْع سَماوات ) is a word in the Qur'an referring to the existence of the Seven Heavens. Other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity , also talk about the Seven Heavens. The notion has explicitly occurred in the Qur'an seven times. Muslims have proposed different views regarding what is meant by the Seven Heavens in the Qur'an . There are hadiths talking about Seven Earths as well. According to Quranic verses, the creation of the Seven Heavens occurred gradually in six days. According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the \"Dominions of the Heavens\" that is said in the Qur'an to have been shown to Abraham (a) was the same as the Seven Heavens and Earths and the creatures in them. According to hadiths concerning the Prophet (s) 's Mi'raj , he ascended to the Heavens, up to the Seventh Heaven. In Different Religions The Seven Heavens are mentioned in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Qur'an has mentioned explicitly the Seven Heavens seven times in the suras al-Baqara : 29, al-Isra' : 44, al-Mu'minun : 86, Fussilat : 12, al-Mulk : 12, Nuh : 3 and al-Talaq : 15, and two times implicitly. The Seven Earths Unlike the word, \"sama'\" (sky or heaven), which is used in the Qur'an in the plural form together with number seven , the word, \"ard\" (Earth), is used in the singular form, with no mention of how many earths there are. Some people say that the Quranic verse , \"It is Allah who has created seven heavens, and of the earth [a number] similar to them.\" , implies that there are Seven Earths from a Qur'anic point of view. There are explicit hadiths according to which there are Seven Earths. Also, the phrase, \"al-aradin al-sab'\" (Arabic: الأرَضِینَ السَّبْع ), (the Seven Earths), appears in a dhikr which is recommended in manual of fatwas to be recited in the prayer 's qunut . Views of Muslims The debate over what is meant by the Seven Heavens has a long history among Muslims. Muslim scholars have proposed various views and accounts of the Seven Heavens. Some of them have tried to interpret the Seven Heavens in terms of their concurrent scientific theories. Here are some accounts of the Seven Heavens: The number of heavens is nine, where al-Kursi and 'Arsh are the 8th and the 9th heavens. The view was espoused by 'Allama Majlisi and Mulla Hadi Sabzawari . It was proposed in order to interpret the Seven Heavens in terms of Ptolemy's theory [11] of the nine celestial spheres. [12] The Seven Heavens are the same as the seven planets. This view was proposed when Uranus and Neptune were not still discovered. The view was espoused by al-Fakhr al-Razi . [13] The Seven Heavens are the circuits of the seven planets. [14] The Seven Heavens ARE material, but all the planets, stars and galaxies of our world are inside the first heaven, and the other six heavens are outside the realm of human knowledge. The view was espoused by Nasir Makarim Shirazi . [15] The Seven Heavens are NOT material heavens; rather the phrase refers to spiritual phenomena, such as closeness to God. The view was propounded by 'Allama Tabataba'i in his al-Mizan . However, he did not totally reject the existence of material heavens. [16] The number, seven , has been used in the Qur'an in the case of the heavens just to imply their abundance. Thus, by the \"Seven Heavens\" the Qur'an means that there are many heavens. [17] The Seven Heavens are material heavens that were, according to the Qur'an , one single heaven at the beginning, which were produced from gas (or as put by the Qur'an , smoke. [18] ). The Creation of the Seven Heavens in Six Days According to seven verses of the Qur'an , God created the heavens and the Earth in 6 days. According to Sura Qaf , \"And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days. According to a hadith , Imam al-Baqir (a) considered the objection that when the heavens were not still created, time did not exist either. So, how does God say that He has created them in \"six days\"? He then replied that there is another heaven known as the \"Highest Sphere\" (al-Falak al-A'la) on which the time is based. The Reason for the Gradual Creation According to a hadith from Imam al-Rida (a) , God had the power to instantaneously create the heavens and the Earth. The reason for the gradual creation was to show each creature to angels in order, so that they could argue for the existence of God from their incipience. Inhabitants of the Seven Heavens According to hadiths, creatures such as angels and some prophets (a) live in each of the Seven Heavens. For example, according to a hadith cited in Tafsir al-Qummi regarding the Prophet (s) 's Mi'raj , the prophet Adam (a) and some angels, such as the Angel of Death , inhabit the first heaven; prophets John the Baptist (a) and Jesus (a) live in the second heaven; the prophet Joseph (a) lives in the third heaven; the prophet Idris (a) lives in the fourth heaven; Aaron (a) the son of Amram lives in the fifth heaven, and Moses (a) the son of Amram lives in the sixth heaven. The Prophet Muhammad's Ascension to the Seven Heavens There are frequently cited hadiths in Shiite and Sunni books of hadiths according to which the Prophet (s) ascended to the heavens in an event known as Mi'raj in which he went up to the seventh heaven. This is pointed out in two Quranic suras of al-Isra' and al-Najm . There was a dialogue between God and the Prophet (s) during the Mi'raj, which came to be known as the Hadith of Mi'raj . The hadith is cited in Irshad al-qulub . The Seven Heavens and the Divine Kursi Riyad al-salikin has quoted from Sunni sources of hadiths that the Prophet (s) introduced the greatness of Kursi compared with the Seven Heavens to be a ring in a vast desert. Dominions of the Heavens and the Earth In Sura al-An'am , verse 75, the Qur'an talks about showing the malakut or the dominions of Heavens and the Earth to the prophet Abraham (a) . According to hadiths, the heavens in this verse are the same as the Seven Heavens. According to a hadith from Imam al-Baqir (a) , the verse implies that God has shown the Seven Heavens and Earths and creatures inside them to Abraham (a). According to this hadith, God has done the same for the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) as well. Notes References"}
{"title": "Tawhid", "text": "Tawḥīd (Arabic: التَوحيد ), or monotheism is the most fundamental doctrine in Islam , which means believing in the oneness and uniqueness of God and not ascribing any partners to Him. The message of the Prophet Muhammad (s) since the beginning of his mission was based on the call for tawhid and the rejection of polytheism . Tawhid is a major theme in the Qur'an and hadiths . Al-Tawhid is also one of the names of sura 112 of the Qur'an, which presents a brief but deep expression of the doctrine. In Islam, tawhid stands in contrast to shirk (ascribing partners to God). Muslim theologians have counted a number of levels for tawhid: al-tawhid al-dhati (unity of the divine essence), which refers to the belief in God as the only God and negating any partners for Him; al-tawhid al-sifati (unity of the divine attributes), which refers to the identity of divine essence with divine attributes; al-tawhid al-af'ali (unity of actions), which refers to the fact that God is the only independent cause and that He needs no assistance for His actions; al-tawhid al-'ibadi (unity of worship), which refers to the fact that no one other than God deserves to be worshiped . There are various arguments for tawhid in the Qur'an, hadiths, and the works of Muslim philosophers and theologians. The argument of tamanu' (Argument of Antagonism), the argument from appointing prophets , and the Argument of the Impossibility of Multiplicity are some of the arguments presented by Muslim theologians and philosophers for tawhid. Some Sunnis, including Ibn Taymiyya , Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab , and 'Abd al-'Aziz Bin Baz, have regarded asking for shafa'a and tawassul as instances of shirk. Based on the teachings of the Qur'an, other Muslims reject this idea and maintain that there is no problem in asking for intercession when the intercessor is not considered divine and asking for intercession is done just to honor the intercessor and get closer to God through them. Shiite scholars have written extensively on the topic of tawhid. Some of their works are devoted exclusively to tawhid, and others are parts of works on theology. Some of these books are al-Tawhid by al-Shaykh al-Saduq , Gowhar-i murad by 'Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji , al-Rasa'il al-tawhidiyya by Allama Tabatabai , and Tawhid by Morteza Motahhari . Meaning Tawhid, in the sense of believing in the oneness of God, is the most fundamental Islamic doctrine, according to which the One God is the sole creator of the world and does not have any partners. Tawhid is also used, as seen in some hadiths, to mean confessing this doctrine. Sometimes the term tawhid refers to the theological discussions related to God, His attributes, and actions. According to hadiths , the Prophet (s) used the word to mean the affirmation of the proposition \"lā ilāh illā Allāh, waḥdah lā sharīk lah\" ( لا إله إلا ألله، وحده لاشريک له , there is no god except Allah, he is one and has no partner). In response to questions about tawhid, Imam al-Sadiq (a) and Imam al-Rida (a) have brought up some theological discussions such as negating human attributes from God. There are three different types of tawhid, Theological tawhid, which refers to the belief in the oneness of God based on theological arguments; Philosophical tawhid, which is the belief in the oneness of God based on purely rational arguments; Mystical tawhid, which goes beyond concepts and refers to witnessing the One [4] Being from whom all beings originate. In Mulla Sadra's Transcendental Philosophy , all these types of Tawhid are combined and mystical experiences have been juxtaposed with intellectual arguments. Place in Islam Tawhid is regarded as the most important characteristic teaching of Islam. As the Qur'an stipulates, all the prophets (a) called people to tawhid. Although the term \"tawhid\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an, there are many Qur'anic verses that are related to the affirmation of tawhid and negation of polytheism, such that the main purpose of the Qur'an is considered by Mulla Sadra in his exegesis to be the affirmation of tawhid. Confessing tawhid and rejecting polytheism are among the first teachings of the Prophet (s), which he proclaimed at the beginning of his mission in Mecca . The representatives that the Prophet (s) sent to various places, such as Mu'adh b. Jabal , would first and foremost call people to tawhid. Imam Ali (a) states that believing in the oneness of God is the foundation of knowing God. Tawhid is emphasized in the Qur'an in various words and expressions. Negating other gods, emphasizing the oneness of God for all, condemning polytheists, rejecting the Trinity, and negating anything that is similar to God are among the themes related to tawhid in the Qur'an. Some of the Qur'anic verses about tawhid are, Say, 'He is Allah, the One'. ( Qur'an 112 :1) There is no god except Allah. ( Qur'an 37 :35, Qur'an 47 :19) Your god is the One God, there is no god except Him. ( Qur'an 2 :163) Your God is the One God. ( Qur'an 18 :110, Qur'an 21 :108, Qur'an 41 :6) There is no god except Allah, the One. ( Qur'an 38 :65) Levels In accordance with the Qur'an and the sayings of the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) , many theologians, philosophers, and mystics have counted several levels for tawhid: Al-Tawhid al-dhati (unity of the essence), Al-Tawhid al-sifati (unity of the attributes), Al-Tawhid al-af'ali (unity of actions), Al-Tawhid al-'ibadi (unity of worship). [13] In Islam, tawhid is in contrast with shirk (ascribing partners to God), and thus eliminating shirk is one of the main themes and aims of the Qur'an. Just as different levels have been mentioned for tawhid, shirk also is considered to have different levels: al-shirk al-dhati is the belief in more than one God; al-shirk al-af'ali is the belief in more than one independent cause in the world; al-shirk al-sifati is the belief in the ontological multiplicity of God's attributes and their distinction from His essence, and al-shirk al-'ibadi is worshipping something other than the one God. Unity of the Essense Unity of the essence is the first stage of monotheism, consisting in the belief in the oneness of divine essence. That is, the divine essence is not subject to plurality and has no peer. In the terminologies of theology and philosophy , Unity of essence has two meanings: God is one, it has no peer, and it is inconceivable for Him to have a second. The divine essence is simple, in the sense of not being composed of parts. [21] Qur'an 112 (Sura al-Tawhid), refers to both kinds of Unity of essense: the word 'Aḥad' at the beginning of this sura refers to the simplicity of divine essence, and the last verse ('there is none like unto Him') refers to the rejection of any peers and partners about God. Unity of the Attributes Unity of the attributes is the view that the divine essence is identical with divine attributes. Thus, the divine knowledge is not distinct from divine power; all His being is both knowledge, power, and other attributes through and through, and all His attributes are identical to one another and to his essence. Contrary to other beings, in which attributes are distinct from their essence, and they gain the attributes. Qur'an has cleared God from the attributes. In a speech narrated by Abu Basir , Imam al-Sadiq (a) attributes divine knowledge, hearing, sight and power to divine essence and has stipulated that God has been able to hear and see before there had been anything to be heard or seen. Unity of Actions Unity of actions (al-tawhid al-af'ali) is the view that in order to do His acts, God does not need anything or anyone other than His own essence—He is independent in all His acts. According to the unity of actions, nothing in the world can have any effects or do anything except in virtue of the power it is given by God; all actions, movements, and effects are originated in His essence. He has no partners in His essence, He has no partners in His agency—including creation, monitoring, owning, and governing the world. Qur'an introduces God as the creator of everything and the one, all paramount. Imam al-Sadiq (a) has considered God as the only one who can create something from nothing. Unity of Worship Unity of worship is a sort of theoretical monotheism, which amounts to the thought that nothing except Allah is worthy of worshiping—that is, there is no god except Allah. Therefore, every person has to worship God and on the basis of His commands. According to Qur'an inviting to worship the One God is the primary mission of all of the prophets . Monotheism in worship has been referred to by some Qur'anic verses, such as Qur'an 6:102, Qur'an 1 :2-5, Qur'an 21 :25. This is taken to be implied by other types of monotheism: if our existence is from Allah, our survival depends on Him, the only truly independent cause in the world is Allah, and it is only Allah who has the right to command and legislate, then no one else is worthy of worship. Any non-divine motivations involving in worships reduces their value and it sometimes leads to their religious invalidity. Arguments In the Qur'an and hadiths and in the works of Muslim philosophers and theologians, a number of arguments have been mentioned for tawhid. Some of these arguments are as follows: Argument of Tamanu' (mutual exclusion), which is based on Qur'an 21 :22 [34] , seeks to demonstrate tawhid by refuting shirk. [35] This argument has been formulated in the following way: If there were two gods and one of them willed to do something and the other willed to do its opposite, one of the following would happen: Argument of Multiplicity is among the arguments set forth in Islamic philosophy for the oneness of God. According to this argument, if there were more than one god (or necessary existent), each of them would have a common aspect with the other gods—as they all are necessary existents—and an exclusive aspect. This means that each god is combined of a common aspect and an exclusive aspect. However, this is impossible, because a necessary existent cannot be a compound being, as every compound being is in need of its parts, and therefore its existence is not necessary by itself. Therefore, there is only one necessary existent. [37] Other arguments have also been presented by Muslim theologians and philosophers for the oneness of God, such as the Argument of Specificity (ta'ayyun), the Argument of the Impossibility of Multiplicity , the Argument of the Multiplicity of the Objects of Power , and the Argument from Appointing the Prophets . The latter is taken from Imam Ali's (a) letter to his son Imam al-Hasan (a) , in which it is stated that if God had any partners, they would send their prophets to people. Accusations Against the Shi'a Wahhabis regard the Shiite practice of asking the Prophet (s) and Imams (a) for intercession and seeking the blessings of their graves and relics as shirk. However, the Shi'a reject this accusation and believe that those who do so never intend to worship these friends of God and do not believe in their divinity. Their intention is only to honor those righteous servants of God and to get closer to God by honoring them. According to Ibn Taymiyya , whoever asks Imam Ali (a) for intercession is an infidel and whoever doubts the infidelity of such a person is also an infidel . Moreover, he maintained that whoever visits the grave of the Propeht (s) or anyone else and asks them for something is a polytheist , who must be required to repent or be killed if he refuses to repent. Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz, the contemporary Wahhabi mufti, also considered asking the dead for healing or victory over the enemies as instances of the greater shirk. Based on the Qur'an , the Shia reject the act of asking for intercession only if the one who is asked for intercession is considered as acting independently of God and His permission. It is this case that is an instance of the greater shirk in the lordship of God. In response to Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab and his followers who adduce the Qur'anic verses that criticize polytheists for seeking the intercession of their gods, Shiite scholars point to the fundamental difference between their action and the Shiite practice of asking the Prophet (s) and the Imams (a) for intercession, which is the fact that, unlike the polytheists, Shiites do not believe in the divinity of the Prophet (s) or the Imams (a) and do not regard them as independent agents of intercession. Bibliography Shiite scholars have authored many works related to the topic of tawhid. These works include the ones that are exclusively on the topic of tawhid and the ones that discuss this topic along other beliefs and doctrines. Some of these works are as follows: Kitab al-Tawhid by al-Shaykh al-Saduq , which is basically a collection of hadiths related to the oneness of God, His attributes , free will and predestination , and so forth. Sharh bab hadi 'ashar by Miqdad b. 'Abd Allah al-Suyuri about the principles of Shiite beliefs. Its first chapter concerns monotheism.

{"title": "Prophethood", "text": "Al-Nubuwwa (Arabic: النُبُوَّة ) or Prophethood is a divine selection of a person to whom divine teachings are revealed in order to lead people to the path of perfection and happiness. The main features of the prophets include the reception of wahy (revelation), the power to perform miracles , and infallibility . The necessity of prophethood and the rise of prophets is emphasized in the Qur'an , hadiths from the Infallibles (a), and theological texts. Reasons given for its necessity include giving an ultimatum to human beings, their essential need for revelations, and their need for a community. According to the Qur'an, all the prophets shared common goals, such as calling to monotheism and resurrection , pursuit of justice , teaching and training people, purification of their souls, piety , and liberating people from their burdens and shackles. The doctrine of prophethood counts as a principle of religion , the belief in which is considered as a necessary condition of being a Muslim. In Islam , the doctrine refers to the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and other prophets referred to in the Qur'an or the Prophet Muhammad's (s) tradition . The prophethood began with Adam (a) , and according to explicit verses of the Qur'an, it ended with the Prophet Muhammad (s). This belief is shared by Shi'a and Sunni Muslims. By an appeal to Quranic verses and hadiths from the Infallibles (a), the Shi'as believe that after the end of prophethood, God has selected the Imams (a) to preserve and explain the religion . The Notion According to the Qur'an, prophethood is a divine selection of certain people to whom divine teachings are revealed in order to guide people to the path of perfection and happiness. The belief in prophethood is an essential element of Islam as well as other divine religions. The word, \"nubuwwa\" (Arabic: نبوّة ) and its cognates in Arabic have been used to mean different things, such as giving news , heights , going out of a place , a clear path , and a secret voice . According to the majority of scholars, there are differences between a \"nabi\" (Arabic: نبي , prophet) and a \" rasul \" (Arabic: رسول , meaning: messenger): while every \"rasul\" is also a \"nabi\", not all \"nabis\" are \"rasuls\". A \"rasul\" receives revelations in both waking and sleeping times, but a \"nabi\" only receives them while dreaming. Moreover, a revelation to a \"rasul\" is more transcendent than the one to a \"nabi\", since a revelation to a \"rasul\" is delivered by Jabra'il , while a revelation to a \"nabi\" is delivered by other angels or by an inspiration to the heart or through a true dream . However, some people take \"rasul\" and \"nabi\" to be synonymous. General and Special Prophethood In theological books, prophethood is discussed under two major sections i.e. general prophethood and special prophethood. General prophethood refers to a set of discussions addressing such issues as the necessity of sending prophets, infallibility and miracles while in special prophethood the issues about the prophethood of a specific individual are discussed including the reasons for his prophethood and his miracles. Reasons for its Necessity The necessity of prophethood has been emphasized by the Qur'an, hadiths from the Infallibles (a) , as well as theological texts. Reasons for its necessity include giving an ultimatum to people, as an essential need of human beings, and their need for a community. The Qur'an has emphasized the necessity of prophethood due to the human needs, including their need for justice , purification, and learning. [13] This is explained by the fact that human beings cannot realize justice in their communities on their own and without guidance by prophets, since the realization of justice in all aspects of life requires the clarification of its various instances by the prophets. Moreover, it requires that a justice-based law guarantees the rights of all people in all aspects. It also requires a just, fair enforcer who is not under the influence of his psychological desires and personal needs. [14] Since all these conditions require prophethood, they are considered as reasons for its necessity. Prophethood is also considered as a preliminary for other human needs, such as education and training. [15] The necessity of prophethood has been expressed in hadiths in different ways. In reply to a question, Imam al-Sadiq (a) referred to the impossibility of a direct relation between God and people and considered the prophets to be messengers who should be among people to let them know about divine commands and prohibitions. [16] In another hadith, Imam 'Ali (a) considered the reasons for prophethood to include the confirmation of the human intellect, revival of fitra (human initial nature), prevention of ignorance, as well as reminding divine blessings. [17] In Islamic mysticism , philosophy , and kalam : in the Islamic philosophy, the necessity of prophethood has been explained in mundane, this-worldly terms. They take prophethood to be necessary because human beings are social and civil creatures, and a social life requires prophets. [18] In Islamic theology or kalam, the necessity of prophethood is explained, inter alia , by the Principle of Kindness (Qa'ida al-Lutf). According to this principle, since God is required to help His servants to obey Him and to avoid sins , He is required to send prophets. [19] In Islamic mysticism, the necessity of prophethood is explained in terms of a heavenly outlook according to which the existence of a Perfect Man (al-Insan al-Kamil) is necessary, and thus, prophethood is necessary. In other words, Muslim mystics take the prophet to be a complete manifestation of the Greatest Name (al-Ism al-A'zam) of God, and thus, maintain that the presence of such a person is necessary. [20] Goals According to Quranic verses , all prophets shared some goals, including the call for monotheism and resurrection , establishing justice, education and training, purification and piety , as well as liberating people from their burdens and shackles. The call to monotheism is taken to be the most important goal of prophets. According to the Qur'an , all prophets called people to believe in monotheism and avoid polytheism and idolatry . [22] According to the Qur'an, the call to resurrection was also a goal of prophets. They warned people about a life after death in which all human actions will be examined, and so, everyone has to be careful about what they do in order to avoid being punished in the Afterlife . [23] The Qur'an takes justice to be another goal of prophets. They fought social corruptions and tried to establish justice in their communities. [24] The prophet Saleh 's fight with extravagance and wastefulness, [25] Lot 's fight with sexual deviations, [26] and Shu'ayb 's fight with fraudulent transactions and economical corruptions [27] are instances of attempts made by prophets to establish social justice, as mentioned in the Qur'an. [28] Purification of the soul and piety are also goals of prophets which, according to the Qur'an, play a significant role in the salvation of the human being. Purification is mentioned as a goal of prophets in at least three Quranic verses. Piety is also mentioned in various Quranic verses as a goal of prophets. In Sura al-Shu'ara' and Sura al-Saffat , there are verses with the same composition implying that prophets such as Noah (a) [29] , Hud (a) [30] , Saleh (a) [31] , Lot (a) [32] , Shu'ayb (a) [33] , and Elijah (a) [34] have recommended their people to observe piety. [35] Characteristics  Prophets have certain characteristics, such as the direct or indirect reception of wahy (revelation), performing miracles to prove their prophethood, as well as 'isma (infallibility). Reception of Revelations \"Wahy\" (or revelation)—the conveyance of God's words to prophets—is, according to the Qur'an, a common characteristic of all prophets, including Noah (a), Ibrahim (a) , Isma'il (a) , Jesus (a) , and Muhammad (s) . God conveys religious doctrines and orders to guide people to prophets through Jabra'il or without any mediation. Miracles A miracle is an extraordinary act performed by prophets to prove their prophethood—such acts are the ones that cannot be done by ordinary people. Various verses of the Qur'an refer to miracles by prophets. The majority of Shiite theologians believe that miracles are directly performed by God. On the contrary, the majority of the philosophers maintain that prophets can perform miracles because of the extraordinary power of their souls. Infallibility According to Shiite theologians , infallibility is a grace bestowed by God, and according to philosophers, it is an internal power within the prophets which helps them avoid sins or disobedience of God, although they have the power to do so. Some Shiite muhaddiths , such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq , believe that prophets become infallible from the beginning of their prophethood. According to al-Saduq, the prophet might make inadvertent mistakes (\"sahw\"). However, al-Shaykh al-Mufid , a prominent student of al-Shaykh al-Saduq, criticized his teacher's view, considering the theory of inadvertent mistakes to fail to acknowledge the place of prophets. Al-Shaykh al-Mufid takes the infallibility of the Prophet Muhammad (s) to be superior and more wide-ranging than that of other prophets. Prophets The first prophet was Adam (a) who was created, together with his wife, Eve , in heaven , and was ousted from there because of eating the \" forbidden fruit \". And the last prophet was Muhammad (s) who was born in 570 in Mecca . Five prophets are considered as Ulu l-'Azm , that is, they brought a new religion with new rulings. Other prophets propagated the religion of their Ulu al-'Azm predecessors. Prophets have different degrees. The Qur'an has only mentioned twenty-six prophets. In most of the hadiths , the number of prophets is said to be 124000, 313 of which are \"rasuls\". According to other hadiths, there were eight thousand prophets. According to al-'Allama al-Majlisi , these eight thousand people were prominent prophets. Prophets with a Divine Book Some prophets had a divine book. Divine messages they received were collected in a sacred or a divine book and served as the main source for their followers to act upon. Some prophets who had a divine book include: Noah (a), Ibrahim (a) ( Suhuf or Scrolls of Abraham), David (a) ( Zabur ), Moses (a) ( Torah ), Jesus (a) ( Gospel ), and Muhammad (s) (the Qur'an). Women’s Prophethood No women in the Quran is called a \"prophet\" or \"apostle\" and thus the commentators have disagreed as to whether there were any female prophets. Opponents Al-Baydawi , the Sunni commentator of the 8th/14th century states that it is the consensus of Muslims that women did not reach the position of prophethood. According to some other commentators, almost all Muslim scholars agree that there were no female prophets. Allama Tabatabai believes that women were not prophets, but there is another kind of revelation that is not exclusive to prophets such as the revelation to the mother of Moses . Ayatollah Javadi Amoli maintains that there are two types of prophethood: informed ( inba'i ) prophethood and legislative ( tashri'i ) prophethood. Since the latter involves administrative tasks, it was not given to women, but the former, which is about knowing the truths of the world, is not exclusive to men. Among the reasons used by the opponents of the prophethood of women is the verse \"We did not send [any apostles] before you except as men to whom We revealed\" , which indicates that only men reached this position. Proponents Al-Qurtubi, the 7th/13th century commentator, believes that Mary reached the position of prophethood, because, like other prophets, God spoke to her through angels. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani reports that Abu l-Hasan al-Ash'ari and Ibn Hazm believed in the prophethood of women. The latter counted Eve , Sarah , Hagar , Moses’ mother, Asiya (a) , and Mary (a) among prophets. The Finality of Prophethood Khatamiyya (or Finality of Prophethood) is a theological notion and a doctrine shared by all Muslims. According to this doctrine, there will be no prophets after the Prophet Muhammad (s) and thus, there will be no new religion after Islam . The term has its origin in the Qur'an. According to the verse 40 of Sura al-Ahzab , Muhammad (s) was the last prophet. The belief in the finality of prophethood was a widely-accepted doctrine both in the period of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and later. It has always been considered as an essential part of Islam, that is, if someone denies the finality of prophethood, then they will be excommunicated from Islam and it would be as if they have not accepted the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (s). Imamate The Shi'as appeal to several Quranic verses and hadiths , such as Hadith al-Thaqalayn , to hold that after the end of prophethood, God has preserved the last religion—Islam—by Imams who are supposed to protect the religion. They believe that the last Imam who is still alive and lives anonymously will someday be commissioned to rule the whole world with Islam and guide the human beings to perfection.
